[name]Takuya[line]I'm here at the city hotel, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna climb that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This here is a utility pole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Chuushingura」 is actually one of my favorite dramas. Look it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to be doing this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm looking for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a warm light, giving this place a nice atmosphere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light that illuminates the road.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I'd know if Ayumi was around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to this, the entrance is on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The layout of the hotel and a simple map is drawn on here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be a directory of the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the entrance is on the right side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place looks well kept.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at it is pretty pleasing to the eye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't be ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd need heavy duty equipment to take that with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the signboard for the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way I can bring that home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The biggest hotel in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called the Millennium Hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty fancy name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This hotel is huge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the largest resort in all of Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a love hotel, by the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think this used to say okonomiyaki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, it's a sign for monjayaki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. That creepy bellboy is glaring at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like I can get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the entrance is on this side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should try going inside.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Boy[line]You can't go in here without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Who needs permission to go inside a hotel?[%p]
[name]Boy[line]You do. Do you have an appointment?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Boy[line]You look like a student. This isn't a place for people like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Boy[line]Only VIPs with appointments can enter here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just looking for somebody.[%p]
[name]Boy[line]That's completely out of the question. We respect our customers' privacy here and would never do anything to compromise it. That's our policy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk.)[%p]
[name]Boy[line]Students shouldn't be here this late. Go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯don't push![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He pushed me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, this place is fancier than I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No college kids allowed, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's all about money. And I look like I don't have any⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyways, looks like I can't search inside the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came all the way here though. I should look inside the hotel.[%p]
