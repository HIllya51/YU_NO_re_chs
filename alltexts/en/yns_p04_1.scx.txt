[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hilly neighborhood. The houses are all jammed together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house, on the other hand, was order-made in a conceited move by the old bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I actually really like the interior design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind comes in from the ocean. Feels like I'm right by the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house where Ayumi and I live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]â‹¯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the house I live in. I want to get inside fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One of its merits is the view of the ocean from the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really like how spacious it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, one of the demerits is that if you leave the windows open, it's easy for machines to rust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That salty breeze is a pain in the ass, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's not a bad place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, standing here in the ocean breeze isn't gonna increase my savings or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't I just come back from there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't forget anything, so I don't need to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the coastline?[%p]
