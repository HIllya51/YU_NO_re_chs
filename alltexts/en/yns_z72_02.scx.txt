[name]Takuya[line]What is this man doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would be Ryuuzouji be imprisoned here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should talk to Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Release me. Quickly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I promised. I should hurry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This place is huge.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji has been⋯crucified.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before I do that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I talk to Ryuuzouji? He's right here in front of me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh⋯ It's been a long time since I've seen another person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is really strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is it in the middle of this huge chamber?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a crucified man, right here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a giant, circular main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a cylindrical stone in the center.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Man[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His eyes are open. Is he awake?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is this guy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is he here like this?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Mmm⋯ Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His eyes are opening![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you awake?[%p]
[name]Man[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is this guy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is he here, looking like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's been hanging here for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can he even eat from that position?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they free one of his hands so he can eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, there's dust around his hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He clearly hasn't been freed for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His hair and beard have grown long, and his clothes are practically rags.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His hair and clothes would suggest he's been here for months, at least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long has this man been here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ryuuzouji. He's in terrible shape.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should release him like I promised.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His hair and beard have grown long, but it's definitely him.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯ The man in front of me is Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's right, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Only trust what you see with your own eyes. Didn't Koudai teach you that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is tied to a stone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's tied to a stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heheheh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pillar of stone. It's not going to budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are two pillars of stone standing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His hands are secured to an iron bar running between them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a crucifixion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Free my hands. Quickly.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I have much to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's secured to an iron bar.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I can't feel my hands anymore.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've lost track of how long I've been here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's secured tightly to the iron bar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I could get him loose if I hit it with my sword or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's tied really tightly to the iron bar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way to free him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one reason they'd take this much care to make sure he can't get free.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why else would they have him tied so securely?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He must be a prisoner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. He doesn't seem so bad.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Where are you going? You promised.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. A promise is a promise. I should release Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't right now.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, maybe you'll listen to what I have to say instead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. I want to talk to Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to know why he's here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I can't do that right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came all the way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this guy can give me the information I need.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Cut me loose, and I might be able to help you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]It's not like you and I are strangers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know you.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, yes you do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]Don't you recognize me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, that's impossible!)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Koudai led you here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Man[line]I didn't recognize you at first. You look like you've seen a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Long time no see, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't joke around.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's not a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Why are you here, Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Man[line]Th-This⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you talk?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Heh heh⋯ Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the⋯hell?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I can't believe, in a place like this⋯a person like this appears⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he saying?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not responding. He must be unconscious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. He can't be dead.[%p]
*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Man[line]Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thank god. You're still alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he's unconscious. He must have fainted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you okay?![%p]
[name]Man[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Man[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no good. He's not answering.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You promised. Release me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I promised I'd free his hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You have hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, and⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The priestess is always sleeping on the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The altar?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Her mind is nearly gone, but not completely⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Every night, the priestess prays at that altar to prepare for the ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She prays at the altar?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. That's your best chance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Chance?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]They use the prayers to brainwash her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They brainwash her?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. It's one of the God-Monarch's tricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They brainwash the priestess, so she'll do their bidding.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You must interrupt the prayer. Bring her to her senses. You still have time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You need to press the switch beside the pedestal. That will stop the brainwashing device they use on her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Brainwashing device?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Just try it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's the altar?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Calm down. I'll tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There are stairs behind this dungeon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stairs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean the stairs against the wall?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Those stairs lead to the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, I need to go to the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. It's a garden with a beautiful fountain, very different from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Yu-No's altar?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There's a place down a corridor deep within the garden where she's praying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The altar is deep within the garden.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So, will you release me now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then you have to tell me something. Where's Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What do you plan to do once you know where the priestess is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You already know that I'm going to save her.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You might want to reconsider that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Takuya, what if she refuses to be rescued?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No won't refuse, she's waiting for me![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What you hope for conflicts with her current condition⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's lost⋯herself.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Rescuing Yu-No won't matter if she's lost her memories.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. What am I going to do?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's wrong? Are you giving up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll never give up. There's so much more I want to ask.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So, about these restraints⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I can't help you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Are you still mad at me for pointing a gun at you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that was you![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ha! Well, aren't you a master of deflection![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji, will you answer my questions?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I won't talk for free.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you talk to me, I'll release you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Can I trust you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't lie.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Very well, then. Ask what you will.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All righty⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then, can you open these restraints?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Long time no see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Why are you here, Ryuuzouji?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The way you hold that sword, and that look in your eyes⋯ It seems you've been through a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer my questions![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Before that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Can you open these restraints?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The restraints?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's harder than it looks to talk in this position. I'd like to speak a bit more freely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I thought I already told you about the priestess.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's all the information I have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So, you are interested.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I sure am. So?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]In order for her to take on the consciousness of the god, she must seal away her own consciousness. She must give her mind over to the god.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's terrible. Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You want to save her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I do![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Then I'll tell you⋯ She's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But she's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Ryuuzouji, I'll release you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I have to go to her first.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Huh⋯ I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that all of your questions?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot I want to ask, but it'll have to wait. Yu-No comes first.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heheheh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happens during this gifting of the mind?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know the details. I only know what I overheard from the Royal Guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me everything.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]When the god inhabits her body, the priestess must give the god a gift from her own body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of gift?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The last priestess gave the god her voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp* Her voice![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She offered her voice to the god and lost it as the ceremony demands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, she's⋯ They say that priestess is dead now.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know much about that, but now they're talking about a successor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it's hard to find one.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Rumor is, if they share the same bloodline, the ability will be passed on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They have to share the same bloodline?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's what I hear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shared bloodline?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a second.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If the last priestess was Celes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then the one who shares Celes's bloodline is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No! The priestess is Yu-No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, when did she become so beautiful?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She had just reached adulthood the last time I saw her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Amanda told me something about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once her people are through their childhood, they mature very rapidly. Childhood is very short in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've finally found you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I haven't seen you for years⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was right to come to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good. Nothing's wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's⋯wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second, she pointed a sword at me and threatened to kill me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would she do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does this have to do with what Ryuuzouji just told me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A priestess must offer the god a gift from her own body⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means Yu-No has offered something of hers.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Looks like you're lost in thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really⋯ There's something else I want to ask you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said the last priestess offered her voice to the god.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've heard rumors. That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what has the current priestess offered?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Her mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her mind?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You heard me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does it mean to offer your mind?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It was carried out by the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That one scares even me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji, I know you're not my enemy, not really.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]At least you know that much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the enemy of my enemy doesn't necessarily mean you're my friend.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're certainly careful. Heh heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't let the God-Monarch get away with this.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You should probably quit while you're ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got any other advice?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sure. If you're going to do something, do it fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying? Is that disaster going to happen soon?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know, but the priestess's ceremony will soon commence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean it's starting soon?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The time is upon us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The ceremony of the priestess will soon commence⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The priestess⋯must be that woman who pointed a sword at me.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ They only come here once a day, and only long enough to feed me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But from here, I can overhear the Royal Guards muttering among themselves⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When exactly will the priestess hold the ceremony?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sometime in the next two or three days. They said this priestess offered up her mind to the god.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her mind?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does it mean to offer your mind?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that your next question?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I suppose so, yeah.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh⋯ All right.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The God-Monarch⋯that's right. It's hard to say⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that hard.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The general consensus is that they're the supreme ruler of Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that not true?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I said that's the general consensus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The God-Monarch is the reason I'm here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you do something bad?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Good or bad is all about perspective. Not everything in this world is bad for everyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I tried to prevent them from killing the priestess. And this is what I got for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Judging by the look on your face right now, I'd say you don't have all the facts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean they still plan to use the priestess?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's correct.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To stop the coming disaster, they're gonna channel a god in some sort of holy ceremony, right?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sounds like you have the basic idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard a rumor that the God-Monarch's just a fraud ruling through a false religion.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh? I wonder⋯ Heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that's wrong?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, they say the God-Monarch is the real thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course they do. They'd say anything to protect their own terrible leader.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're looking grim. Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing, really. I just want to punch the God-Monarch directly in the face.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]How brave. Do you plan to kill 'em too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Depends what he says.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ That's impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may have failed, but I won't. No matter how closely he's guarded, I'll get him.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No. I still say it's impossible. Heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Ryuuzouji talking about?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm here, because I was captured by the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But this place isn't so bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not so bad⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I can still get away. At least while I'm like this, I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But I can't stay like this forever. I'll have to do something soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously, what are you babbling about?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The reason I'm hanging here is very simple. The God-Monarch captured me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Gonna hear me out after all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of person is this guy?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you really want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm the scary kind of person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]As for the reason why I'm here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh⋯ I've been here so long, I've nearly forgotten.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Don't look so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me why you're trapped down here.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Right. I've been here for many years⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No way⋯years?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Dela Grante is a dimension that has branched off separately from our world.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]At least, that's my theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Dela Grante exists parallel to the world we live in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean parallel?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I can't explain it properly. That's the best I've come up with so far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The world we live in isn't the only one. You've seen that for yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Dela Grante is one of many worlds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, it's too different from our world.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's a branched timeline. Actually, a better way to look at it is more like a branched phenomenon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't understand.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let me explain it more simply then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Take right now, for example. You have no idea who I am, but say 20 generations ago, we might have been as close as brothers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela Grante is a separate branch from our timeline?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know which one is the tree and which is the branch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's ridiculous![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]This is all just conjecture on my part. Mere theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't have any solid evidence to back it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, the culture is so different.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The culture?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Have you ever thought about how many different cultures actually exist on the planet? And those are just the ones we know about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, but the people here are really different from our world, too.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Exactly how are they different?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, what about their pointy ears?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's hardly any difference at all, less even than the difference between Mongoloid and Germanic peoples.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. What about how quickly they mature?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]They mature quickly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. They have a physiological phenomenon that allows them to mature rapidly, in the span of just a few years.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sorry. I don't really know much about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you've been here for a long time.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Exactly. I've been right here for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm not exactly a common sight around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Why are you in this world? Why are you shackled?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that your next question?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Your questions are too vague. What truths are you seeking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, stop acting like a Zen monk.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If I don't understand your question, I can't tell you what you want to know. And I have no doubt you'd cut me down with that sword if I'm not careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then answer my questions. What does this world have to do with our world?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm not sure about that either. All I can give you are guesses and theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's fine. I need to hear some kind of logic right now.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ All right then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got to listen carefully now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Very carefully.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I already told you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father⋯ He's here?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that another question?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, of course![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll answer all your questions. Let's start with the first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There is an ancient race that I believe created the people of Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people of Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]And now for your second question about Koudai. I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh come on, that's not an answer![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I can't answer what I don't know. I could lie to you, but I know that's not what you want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then, I'll rephrase the question.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's⋯change the question.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Getting confused?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You told me this Reflector could show me endless possibilities.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Did I? It was a long time ago, so I'm not sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what is this?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You just answered your own question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want the specifics. Where, why, how, and by whom was this made?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You sound just like Koudai. Heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You look like him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's an old man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back then, you pointed a gun at me. Why? What do you want?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's a lot of questions. I suppose I can answer each of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I pointed the gun at you because I wanted to hear what you had to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not an answer. The answer I want–[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I know. That is the answer to your second question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm listening.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What I wanted back then was the Reflector you have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh ho! I see you got it back. It appears your destiny hasn't changed much, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you want this?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was curious. That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop messing around and tell me the real answer.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Fine. I was going to sell it for a profit. Does that answer make you happy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way it was something so noble as intellectual curiosity.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I don't think he'd be so dumb as to sell it, either.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does this guy want?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Close your eyes. I'll cut the bonds with my sword.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Thanks. Though I feel like I should do more to show my gratitude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll tell you one more thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The God-Monarch will be nearby.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Every morning, the God-Monarch walks through the corridor to check on the priestess at the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He checks on her personally every morning?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. You could say it's part of his daily routine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The God-Monarch walks the garden's corridor every morning, alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not trying to trick me, are you?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I wouldn't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why wouldn't the God-Monarch have guards?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]With such unusually high security outside, he doesn't think there's much need for security inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sounds about right.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Consider it a small token of my gratitude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The God-Monarch goes to the altar every morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Alone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Will that help?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your information will help me a lot.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh⋯ That's a good face you're making.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll rescue you just like I promised.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's a big help. So, what's your plan now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to rescue Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Good. The inhumane conditions here are unforgivable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those are some big words for someone who hides behind a gun.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was just trying to scare you. I wouldn't have shot you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you plan to do now, Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now that I'm free? I'll think about it and get back to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure. A promise is a promise. You should get out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji limped away⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had so much more to ask him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no time for that, now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go save Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The garden is supposed to be at the top of those stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that means this is underneath the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, not yet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll do that after I ask where I can find Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I can't do that now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know there's a reason that Ryuuzouji is being held here like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be a reason he's imprisoned here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. Ryuuzouji pointed a gun at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He wanted to steal the Reflector from me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this the Ryuuzouji I know?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Come on. Hurry up and take these restraints off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a second.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is Ryuuzouji tied up here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what to do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What is the matter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
