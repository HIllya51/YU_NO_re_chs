[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Toyotomi anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. Nothing interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A utility pole. Having fun looking at it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I can't just leave that bastard Toyotomi or Mio alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear her father is the mayor of this city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Politicians make a lot of money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Princess Shimazu's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I gave in to temptation and went there once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a super big mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll probably find Mio there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go after her now, she'll just ask me why I'm there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I walked her home just fine, so it's no problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Meiunji Park, where couples gather every night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The characters mean 「bright clouds.」 There are lots of men and women hoping fate will bring them together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are tons of couples getting together again today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like a park that impedes a guy's healthy development.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the promise of the prosperity of mankind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! Don't they ever get tired of all the hugging and kissing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, looks like more people interested in continuing the human race just entered the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way it's Yuuki and Mio. Hahaha, that's ridiculous. Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are three people, which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's three guys being led by⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Toyotomi. When did he get there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what he's doing here so late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't be surprised if he was a peeper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I kind of hate that guy, and I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go over this guardrail and down that grassy hill, it's right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This apartment building always interested me. It's bigger than most.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an expensive-looking building. I wonder what kind of people live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get there from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a bird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the coastline over there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The next town is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fact is it feels good just looking at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view from here is pretty good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say that gazing at the sky will clear your mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But looking at the sky won't clear away what I went through today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way I could get to the ocean from here is to fly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little far from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at it won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what the people living in this city are thinking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do they live their lives?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many houses. It's distracting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The distraction isn't a big deal, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People live in each and every one of these houses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Every one of those people is living their own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like me to think like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This town never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no guarantee that will always be the case, especially for me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go back downtown yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did we come here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't use that item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you have something better to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! I can't use that there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just give it some more thought.[%p]
