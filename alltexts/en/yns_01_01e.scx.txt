[name]Takuya[line]I need to call Mitsuki first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the desk![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried: she said it was urgent, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to make the call. It's on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wasn't I about to call Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I wonder what was so urgent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and call Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? No one's answering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'll see her tomorrow. She's teaching the remedial classes I'm taking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](From what he said, it didn't seem particularly unusual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'll never forget what happened.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I won't forget staring down the barrel of a gun last night.)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems there's something special about this Reflector I've got.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When I showed this to Ryuuzouji before, he made a strange face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, that would be reckless. What if he points a gun at me again?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And that old woman, Ryuuzouji's mother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think that old woman was even more strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What did she want to say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](According to Ryuuzouji, it's just dementia.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It could be that, of course, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Other things were strange too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was Ms. Eriko doing there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She was in that⋯peculiar position.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stuck to a branch, unable to get down⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess even a hundred-year romance can turn sour⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or not.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was she doing over there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how you look at it, she was sneaking into Ryuuzouji's mansion.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko said she was going to pick up a ball.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looked more like a burglar.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ah⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sleepy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that I think about it, I barely slept at all last night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I spent so long waiting for Ayumi, there wasn't time to sleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I eventually saw Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I ought to sleep like a rock tonight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll sleep⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯all night⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dreaming⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's up? Did you go skinny dipping or something?))[%p]
[name]Woman[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I can't understand if you don't answer. You know, if you go on those rocks naked, you'll get all scratched up.))[%p]
[name]Woman[line]((Oh⋯ Ah⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a peaceful expression.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like I'm back safe in my room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or like I've finally found the place I belong.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old man⋯)
[name]Takuya[line](I don't need anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be using stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this really the best time to use that?)[%p]
