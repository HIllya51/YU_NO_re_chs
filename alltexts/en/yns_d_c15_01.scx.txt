[name]Takuya[line]It's a dim, small room, surrounded on all sides by rock walls.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be careful Takuya. There might be traps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's a primitive sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not rusty⋯ It's really heavy though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What an amazing discovery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We don't know that's what it is yet.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you going to do with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might come in handy.[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Iron Sword][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Iron Sword][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing out of the ordinary here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air feels so heavy here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls, the ceiling⋯ It's all stone, through and through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's the air coming from, anyway?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I just noticed it's not stuffy in here at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made of pretty sturdy stuff.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It feels like some kind of secret chamber.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are pebbles on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't really anything on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing but pebbles⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be careful. There might be traps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure why, but there are seams in this wall⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This wall looks different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't slide side to side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
Gah⋯ Grrr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. No good. Pushing won't even make it budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pushing doesn't work.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And there's nothing to pull, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see a dividing line here⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This wall looks different.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't think we need to push it anymore, do we?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. The left door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a small button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Mitsuki[line]The door closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll open if I push the button again.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder what it could mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But do we have anything else to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a small button.[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh⋯ The door opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Each time I press the button, the door opens or closes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But⋯ Won't the door open if you push it again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It looks like a button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯ The door on the right closed![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I just said we don't know if there are any traps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We're trapped here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calm down, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the door closed when I pushed the button⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then maybe if I press it again, it'll open.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. You shouldn't push it so much.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The door is already open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Forget the button. I should focus on moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a small button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? It looks like if the right door isn't closed, the left door won't open.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But why would they have to set up such an elaborate system?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is there some reason they can't be opened at the same time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, something is strange here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Every time we move forward, our path to go back becomes blocked somehow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well either way, the door is open. We can go forward.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Looks like there's a small button on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Nothing happened. Maybe this button doesn't do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. You shouldn't push it so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It looks like a button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange⋯ Nothing's happening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. You shouldn't push it so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. There's no turning back now.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's be careful going forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We just came from that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What we need to do is move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, we just came from there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So what do we do, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
