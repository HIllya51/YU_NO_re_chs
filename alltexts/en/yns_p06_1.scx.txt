[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no more students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The announcement called me to the laboratory. That's on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Actually, we're breaking up.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Huh, I said that yesterday?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That's must be your imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a couple here a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]We're in the middle of breaking up. Can it wait?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm just kidding.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]You're the walking libido.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Wh-Why are you hitting me?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You're Arima, the walking libido, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Why the long face?[%p]
[name]Student[line]I already told you yesterday. Huh, you weren't listening?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Okay, one more time. Once the main story starts, talking to me is a good idea.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Huh, how is it good?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Seeing is believing. Make sure you talk to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in front of the bulletin board now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Talk to me once the main story starts.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Oh, hi.[%p]
[name]Student[line]You came all the way to talk to me, so I'll tell you something good.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Once the main story starts, talking to me might be a good idea.[%p]
[name]Student[line]What? You don't know what the main story is?[%p]
[name]Student[line]You'll know if you just keep playing the game.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall is open all the way to the third floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was built in hopes to foster open minds in the students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air conditioning works well. It's really open and feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Taking a left at the hallway ahead takes us to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ms. Eriko isn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Taking a right at the intersection? I wonder what's that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I actually don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the hall isn't helping anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see any students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they all went home already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are still some students left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're probably all in afterschool clubs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still see students here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably by some famous artist and normal people don't understand it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see the point of art that normal people can't understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I don't understand this art.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Let's go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, yeah⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's true⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I don't want to go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was summoned, okay? So let's go to the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going up to the second floor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't anything for me up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the laboratory is at the end of the hall on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what this is about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I've been summoned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I turn left at the intersection, I'll arrive at the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go there now.[%p]
