[name]Takuya[line]Seeing Triangle Mountain at night reminds me of the night before last.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It all started then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the shrine. No one's here, as usual.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, aren't you Ayumi's Minion A?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Who are you calling a minion? You shouldn't point at people. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is a public place, last I heard. There's no reason for you to ask me that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. You're a cheeky one. This area is under direct supervision of Geo Technics because of the construction expansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, oh really?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't pick your nose in front of other people. Listen here, kid. You can't go near the shrine without my, the construction director's, permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Can I get your permission?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all the same even if I ask you, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No, it's not the same as me saying no and not saying anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the difference?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Me saying no or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy stupid?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, this old shrine is going to be torn down soon anyway. Might as well enjoy it while you can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! You're kidding, right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No, I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is one of our town's most famous locations.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]There's no law against tearing down famous locations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people who live around here won't be quiet about this.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Unfortunately for them, we got permission from the mayor, and we already finished the legal proceedings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯why?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's confidential.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're tearing down this shrine with nothing but the mayor's permission, and you're not telling anyone why?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The mayor acts as the representative for the people of his town. That means the decisions he makes are also the decisions of the people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Man, this guy is just talking nonsense now.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If you have any objections, I suggest you take it to court.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Don't be ridiculous![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, it's that Shimazu⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know it was wrong, but I was listening from the shadows, Mr. Toyotomi![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Uh, all right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You intend to destroy the Sword Cape? Are you out of your mind?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I-I'm not sure what you mean. I was merely following company policy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The Sword Cape could easily be designated as an important cultural monument.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]B-But we have the mayor's permission⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This is a democracy. My father's decisions don't take immediate effect.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But it's only a matter of time before the council agrees.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The government functions as a democracy. Waiting to get approval after the fact is outrageous.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, I-I, uh, have to be somewhere. Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. Don't look so pleased with yourself. Justice will prevail in the end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Has all the construction addled that guy's brains?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was an amazing speech, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It wasn't just for you. I want to protect the Sword Cape with all of my heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. That really got to your history nerd side, didn't it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't call me a history nerd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about frenzied college girl?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't get mad at me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm disgusted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you want to investigate around here again?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes. I think those Twin Boulders hold some kind of secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Up until a few decades ago, they were the Triplet Boulders.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. But it's more than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did something happen with Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp* Why do you ask?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with the weird answer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, ahem, when you say Hatano, I assume you mean Kanna. What about her?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I heard Hatano has told the school she's dropping out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! But Ms. Eriko said she didn't mind if she dropped out.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, so you knew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've only heard rumors, but it seems the school found out about her behavior.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her behavior?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Um⋯ I would never try to slander her, but it seems her relationships with the opposite sex have been⋯extensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I understand it was her decision to drop out. It's all over the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯ When was this?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just heard it myself. Maybe this afternoon?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's after I saw her at the park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seemed pretty concerned. Maybe I shouldn't have let her go.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, don't look so serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not. It's about her.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph, you don't even go to your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do my remedial classes have to do with Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as usual⋯wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a woman crouched down by that rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mio. I wonder what she's doing.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There isn't enough information about the Twin Boulders.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So this engraving isn't suspected of being man-made⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But if that's the case⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mio[line]Ahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey pretty lady. What're ya doin'?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, Arima? What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my line. What are you doing in such a rocky place?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if she was examining the rocks.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would she need to examine the rocks though?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the foot of Triangle Mountain. I can't believe last night happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ There's a woman crouched down by that rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, why am I so worked up?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I always feel so strange when I see her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep running into you today. What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't think you should come over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't go over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it is under Geo Technics management now, so it wouldn't be good to just stroll in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That must be what she meant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, these are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Flowers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are flowers here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she leave them there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the shrine. No one's here, as usual.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a bad feeling about this.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line](Nothing I can say to that. Dammit.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Just don't forget that Chief Arima is an employee of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Make sure you don't do anything scandalous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by 「scandalous」?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]For instance, a family member of an employee joining protests against the company.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯ I see.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't think that'd be good for Chief Arima, nor for you. Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You are the chief's son, so I can't say much more than that. Enjoy your memories of the shrine, but get going once you're done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr, arguing me down with logic like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's right about most of the stuff he says, but I refuse to separate logic from emotions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're going to tear down this shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth has Ayumi gotten herself involved in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like anyone's here right now.[%p]
