[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He is looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm⋯ It seems our talk has digressed. By the way, Takuya Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Can I ask you one thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as it's something I can answer, yes.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Did Koudai give you something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of something?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've been scouring his research, and some things seem to be missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So I thought you might have what I'm looking for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything. My old man died suddenly.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. Then is there anything he told you to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Maybe he showed you some sketches at some point? Or did he ever talk about a time machine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not at all.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's better not to mention the Reflector⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sure of it.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then, that's about it. Ume.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ume?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]My mother's name is Ume.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, what a problematic woman⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for having me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yeah. I am really sorry about Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you never know. He might still be alive somewhere.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe he's even in the same location, but in a completely different space.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Immortality means not dying old, right?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's what it means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But don't you think it was a little unexpected?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think my old man's that crazy.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So you are saying it's not realistic?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not at all. You aren't making any sense.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What you're saying is that I should judge this by conventional knowledge?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course. There's no evidence to support a hypothesis.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No hypothesis has support. It's the scholar's job to demonstrate it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]For example, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What do you think the beginning of the universe was like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beginning of the universe?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Well, rather, how about the beginning of the world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's say a scholar hypothesizes that the universe has existed forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not realistic. Forever?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's the basis of an entire Asian faith. How about another hypothesis? What about the Big Bang Theory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've read about it. It's the theory that a small, high-density nucleus exploded and became the universe.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. How about that theory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it makes more sense than the universe existing forever.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, that's a more realistic theory to you? Okay, then what was there before the explosion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before the explosion?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. What existed outside of the nucleus you mentioned?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was⋯ There was a universe, wasn't there?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The universe formed by a bunch of explosions. Therefore, that theory makes no sense either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, the Big Bang Theory itself was pure chance.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's go back to my question: how did this world begin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, exactly. There are actually a lot of mysterious and inexplicable things in the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Our scholars have made it their mission to establish a hypothesis and to prove it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'd do that no matter how silly the hypothesis is?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If we can prove it, then we know it's the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's not proven, is it?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's why it is a hypothesis. Remember the words of Galileo, 「And yet it moves.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you think immortality is possible?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nobody knows that. However, it is a very interesting research subject.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you, Ryuuzouji, are studying immortality too?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No. My approach is a bit different. We three had different research focuses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We? Three?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, Koudai Arima, Professor Imagawa, and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is the focus of your research?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]My current focus is humanity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Humanity?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Ryuuzouji's research focus?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, you two are so alike.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*chuckle* The Koudai Arima I remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Your father used to look at me with the same expression in his eyes. He was always deep in thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think you're giving him too much credit.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Are you saying I'm wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Because I clearly remember your father behaving as you do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]May I ask you one thing?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was my father researching?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You want to know what his research focused on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought you and he collaborated.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's right. He and I are old colleagues from college. We've shared a common interest since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We were trying to learn more about the mysteries of history, the stuff you don't see in textbooks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mysteries of history?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That was just our approach. Are you familiar with his theory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it was something about Japanese ancestors being people from a far away continent.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph, I see. You're reading his book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that wrong?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No, it's not a problem. It's just a little superficial.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Even co-researchers like us kept some things hidden from each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was my old man researching?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]His true focus was immortality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Immortality? Really?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, that's right. Of course this is only an inference on my part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My father was researching immortality.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Did she surprise you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That old lady you saw just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. She is quite a unique woman.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. You're very tactful. That was a good response.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just telling you what I saw.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]As I mentioned earlier, my mother has mild dementia. She does not recognize me as her son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dementia⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this why Mitsuki felt weird?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I try not to let her go outside very often. Did she say something strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should answer carefully.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]How about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know this sounds weird, but the definition of strange is kinda relative anyway.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, what she says is a little unusual. Mostly nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of nonsense? Oh, uh, never mind. It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯(Well, from my perspective, it was⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Just?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said you are not your normal self.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Did she really say that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, and she's right. Even to me, it's clear you aren't acting normally.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]How am I not normal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earlier, you said you sold household goods to support academic research.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A normal person doesn't do that. It's a worthy cause.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's significant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious about how you live your life.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's pretty ordinary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where do you sleep?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I sleep on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't like beds or futons. I can only sleep when I'm on a hard floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's so strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He can only sleep on a hard floor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's quite a large mansion.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ah, you think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is several times larger than our place.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The trouble is, managing it is several times more difficult.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's a very old house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't feel like it's old. It feels like a new building to me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We've rebuilt and renovated a few times.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this house is about 400 years old.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's correct. Who did you hear that from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]A Voice[line]Heehee![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gah!)[%p]
[name]A Voice[line]Would the little man like some tea?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, don't worry.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Go to your bedroom. We're having an important discussion right now.[%p]
[name]A Voice[line]Heehee![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is wrong with that old lady?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He looks so serious.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, you resemble your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sometimes Koudai would make the same face you're making right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want him to talk about my old man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He is staring at me with a stern face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've never seen the headmaster smile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is sitting right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He sleeps on a hard floor with only one cushion?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Between that husky physique and the stern face⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd say he looks more like a yakuza boss than a schoolteacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But he was my father's old schoolmate, so I'm sure he's no ordinary guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing in this living room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can he live in a place like this?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You must be really curious. Koudai used to stare around the room like that too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Are you curious about the furniture in our home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was thinking simple is a good thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hm, I thought you were just observing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a living room with almost nothing in it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's empty.)[%p]
