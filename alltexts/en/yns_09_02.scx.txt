[name]Takuya[line](Wow, Ms. Eriko is in the school infirmary for once.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you know something?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you interested in that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I guess the biggest reason is that it's close to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because you're the homeroom teacher?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly. There have been complaints from female students. You could say it's within my responsibilities as the homeroom teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's also of personal interest to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. Why are women so curious about everything?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, you don't know women very well, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Women are attracted to mysterious things. Whether those be incidents or men.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Anyway, I have to clean up the rest of these documents, so off you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that wave of your hand?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't you know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't cause Yuuki too much trouble now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Women are attracted to mysterious things.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko was so passionate about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that difficult to understand.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll bet Mio⋯ I mean, Shimazu knows more about it than I do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I find it easier to talk to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know if I should be happy or upset about this.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So how about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know about the big mansion kitty-corner from the front of the school, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That place is apparently the origin of the curse.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who knows? Walking around there at night would probably give it that impression.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see⋯the atmosphere of a place is significant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Humans are surprisingly perceptive. They can sense things out of the ordinary just by the atmosphere around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Go on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't know if I can agree or disagree, but there are strange sightings being talked about.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of stuff. A four-legged creature, a giant over 7 feet tall, a beast that's not human.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯ Stories are all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some people say it's pranksters, too. People that just want to stand out. They covered it a lot on TV, you know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So when you put it all together, what can you make of it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't put it all together, that's the thing. It's all too different.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But they must have narrowed things down to trustworthy sources by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're saying the four-legged nocturnal animal is the best lead they have.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then, there was a victim.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right, I think I read about that in the newspaper⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ A body with no head nor arms.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The newspaper wrote that it looked like it was torn apart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why they think it's a wild beast. Some expert on TV said it was too difficult for humans to do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. A wild beast, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fortunate that only one victim came about from all this.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What about afterward?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing never showed up again. They say it might have migrated somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph, I see. And the origin of all those rumors is Ryuuzouji's mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, I guess that would be correct.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like she has an idea.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Actually, I heard something from Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, my measurements?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you, an idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Who wants to know the size of your hips or bust?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I want to know yours.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What does that have to do with anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Like hell it does.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It does to me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What the hell are we talking about here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your measurements. My guess is that you're a 34D, 24 waist, and 33 hips.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How rude! My waist is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong with your eyes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're filled with expectations.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*inhale*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough* Don't blow smoke in my face.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Talk to the hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! Are you not going to tell me after all?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, talking with you is so much fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she messing with me?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't make that face. It's a compliment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then why don't you pair it with a hug and a kiss? That's how we do things in Japan.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, yeah. Now, back to the point at hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've heard Yuuki likes all kinds of strange stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope, but the girl he has a crush on does.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. I haven't been around for too long, so can you fill me in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]About the curse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](About the curse?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Also, how are you even here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, I have feet?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought that was a good Yuuki-type joke.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm less tense now, for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's good.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now, how about the real reason?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Uhh⋯ Oh yeah, I have a headache.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Rejected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If it's a headache you can forget about, you'll be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Besides, there's no headache medicine here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We're fresh out. I put in a request at the office to get some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A school infirmary with no headache medicine is like a beef bowl with no beef.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What brought you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I said it was to come see you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That joke is as funny as your own face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch, that hurt.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm trying to find out why you're here when you should be attending your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that is a problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I've confirmed it's a problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But you just can't imagine trying to do something about it, can you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, about passing my class?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have that covered, so don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You have it covered?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I have to do is show up to class and they'll let me pass. It's no problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Considering you're here instead of class, I find that hard to believe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I've got Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So that's what you were talking to him about at the front gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were watching us?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, I can see out there from my office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So that's what you were talking about in the main hall when you mentioned him sitting in for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me just make it clear that he asked me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He wanted to be in that class so badly, and I thought I should help him out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph. It must be for Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you know?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the homeroom teacher after all. Well, I won't scold you about your remedial classes. It's also my responsibility to get you to graduate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That speeds things up.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The way this school teaches is by rote memorization. It's not completely meaningless, but I don't see the need to intentionally memorize everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, you've certainly got an opinion there.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, it serves as a starting point for further study. I don't see any harm in doing it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sure seem to love people watching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is hidden by her hair, as usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, I want to be buried on those hills.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, what are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Curiosity is a good thing. Even school teachers say that![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]While we're on the subject, don't try sneaking your hand up to touch anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, no?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No means no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what about that magnificent fullness?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's bothering me, though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chest and those thighs. I don't know. It makes me a little excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not to mention that V-neck⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can feel your face pressed right between my breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a whole different kind of encounter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those clothes are pretty short.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you bending down in front of me like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You do look more official when you wear that coat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, I've never seen a doctor wear clothes as form-fitting as those.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bangs are covering most of her eyes. She ties the rest of her hair back and throws it over her shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong with your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets as always.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
