[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate. I don't see Mitsuki or Yuuki anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they still looking for Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of the school. I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can see the samurai mansion from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said I could see the mansion from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are the club activities over already?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really want to fix this misunderstanding as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to meet up with Mio to fix this misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Mio went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I saw her go into the school before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoaaa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯ N-Nothing happened last night, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm so disappointed in you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're the worst. We promised![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She went into the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Disappointed? The Worst? Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me I–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no. That would never happen. I don't remember anything after I fell asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aww, that just makes the problem worse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But thinking about it, I can't understand why she said we promised.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did we promise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was I sleep talking and accidentally promised her something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that can't be. What on earth is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet by the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate. I think Mitsuki said she was on night shift.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I should head downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's been waiting for me for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope the entrance is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already so dark.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, how about we stop at a cafe on the way home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously? That's not something a teacher should be saying.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Looks like you had a nice long talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You haven't been waiting here the whole time, have you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you trying to be funny? I'm just waiting for Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki? It's late, where is he?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]He said he got busted for sitting in class for you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, you should have told me about it. I could have done something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's why I'm waiting for him, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is really trying to avoid Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's fine. I think he's with the guidance counsellor, so I'll go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, you don't have to.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's getting late. Miss Mio, let's get you home.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯ I mean, Arima. Please take her back to her house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure, I can do that, I guess.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heh, don't pull anything funny on the way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Careful, she'll hear you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Leave the rest to me. Good-bye, Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You shouldn't treat people like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You blatantly ignored Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just didn't want to talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't want to talk, huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I have the freedom to talk or not talk to whomever I want, don't I? Japan is a free country, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't justify ignoring someone and then turn around and say you're a patriot.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What about you? Did you and Ms. Ichijou do something in the lab again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just stop. We didn't do anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. Oh really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do things have to be this way?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, I'm leaving now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll walk with you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because Ms. Ichijou told you to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, Mitsuki⋯ I mean, Ms. Ichijou has nothing to do with this. I just want to walk you home because it's late at night.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. You two are on a first name basis, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine. You're free to do whatever you like, Miss. I'm going home.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're walking me home, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You said so yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's completely switched up her stance on this.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, which is it? Are you taking me home or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you want me to walk you home now?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No. You said you would, so I figured that might be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want me to walk you home, I will.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If you want to walk me home, you may.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well.)
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did everyone leave already? I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, it's pretty quiet. There aren't many people around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because remedial classes are over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still see some students around though. Staying for club activities, maybe?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She came from inside the school. I don't recall having such an eccentric teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been a while since that lightning incident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did that briefing or whatever end yet?[%p]
