[name]Takuya[line](This is the laboratory.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is sitting on the desk.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You've always been so blunt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a compliment or an insult?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's a compliment. Okay, I don't really know what you want. But if it'll make you feel better, ask me what you need to ask.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't apologize, you idiot. You don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha! You idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](At least Mitsuki agrees. Well, I think she agrees.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she smiling like that? Maybe she understands, but disagrees?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was worth investigating.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thanks for talking to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I should thank you. I embarrassed you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't be an idiot. Just let it go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not a big deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's go. It's already dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We talked for a long time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels late already.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's leave separately. I really want to walk out arm-in-arm with you, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll lock up and leave last. See you tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Bye, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should get out of here anyway.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You always run away when it counts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's fine, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, 「It's fine」?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's getting hot in here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is really coming on to me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki. Um.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I, uh⋯ It's hot in here, don't you think? I'll fan you with this book.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. Perfect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're with Mio, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you ask?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You are, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a kid. Stop treating me like one.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You are![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about. Aren't you a little old to be jealous?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm just young enough to be jealous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I could tell when I talked to you today. And just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't stop thinking about you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]T-Time out![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to tell you something. This is my chance.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay. Tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like you, Mitsuki. My heart doesn't lie⋯ I think.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're getting more and more vague.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make fun of me. It's possible that I'm me, but not really me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you feel like the Takuya in front of you now isn't the same Takuya as before?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya is Takuya. There's no difference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need you to wait until I believe that myself.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know this just sounds like some weird excuse to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm me, but I'm not me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not the same Takuya that Mitsuki knows.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is–)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe this is what Mitsuki is trying to say about Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is different from before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's not the Ryuuzouji that she knows.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You got quiet all of the sudden. Are you going to just leave me like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wouldn't do if you caught a cold.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that face? It's really not a good look for you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can I explain?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll end up hurting Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I feel like doing this here is worse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell am I supposed to do now?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You've been distant since the incident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I haven't seen you much. And now here we are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And what about that girl?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What girl?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, come on. Mio. She likes you, doesn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. There's no way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! You're just as oblivious as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean? We⋯got caught in an awkward situation. That's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what? I can't help that the door opened like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! You should have seen the look on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! You looked pretty ridiculous yourself, you know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mio's face was so red. She was furious⋯ Then she looked sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha! She was so surprised, she couldn't even speak. And I've had a new nickname ever since.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, does Mio take her anger out on you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. She totally hates me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're such a liar. She told me she likes you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*flinch* Why would you say that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She told me not to say anything, but she came to talk to me afterward⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's that look on your face? You look like you got caught doing something naughty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! Anyway, that's when she told me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What did she say?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're making that face again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry up and say it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]「I sort of knew about your relationship with Takuya, Ms. Ichijou. I'm not going to tell anyone, but please stop.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Surprised?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! You're quite the lady-killer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid. Sure, Mio said she wanted to talk to me about something⋯but it's nothing serious.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She wants to tell you she likes you, dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She's a good one. So innocent. Not like me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say that. There's nothing wrong with you, Mitsuki. You have your own unique charm.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I thought you'd say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But to be honest, I was worried you wouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are those tears?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*sigh* I didn't have anyone to talk to, so this helps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure it's okay to talk to a jerk like me?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wouldn't talk to anyone but you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm honored.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Now that I've told you, it's like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, isn't there still a ways to go?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm glad you're happy. Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little late for that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I mean, when your father died⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's not talk about the past.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was only a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like a lot longer to me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were losing it a little back then. But there was nothing you could do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound disappointed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well I was. You punched your advisor, skipped your classes, and quit your club.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That stuff just happened around the same time. It was a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! I was just thinking that was a cute excuse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. You were the one chasing Ryuuzouji around, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, you're right. I was tired, too. Impossible and fictional love⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds like something out of a television show.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! I certainly felt like a heroine in a TV drama.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ryuuzouji is single, isn't he?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sort of. He lives together with his mother, but apparently he and his wife are separated. He's married on paper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His mother? You mean that strange woman?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's not very nice. Ryuuzouji is caring for her now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think you and I were both lonely and needed someone else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]With the way I felt about your father, I completely panicked when he died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't go so far as to say I was out of my mind, but I wouldn't deny it either.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not really strange that we sought each other out. Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Back then⋯ I felt like I was burning with love for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Every day, all I could think of was you. In the bath, while I was eating, even while I was brushing my teeth![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of example is that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wasn't our first time in my room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I said I don't want to talk about the past.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think I was arguing with my old boyfriend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I just stopped by and there was a guy there. I didn't know what to do.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He was drunk, and you went at him all fists and rage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did that, didn't I?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it was only because he was saying bad things about you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was really happy then. I was smitten with a younger man. That's why he was so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Was I your first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No comment.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's what it felt like. I'd be happy if I was your first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're not supposed to ask that kind of question.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you regret it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. I learned a lot.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't ask me that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were so innocent then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't make that face. It was a compliment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No man is happy having the past dug up like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. I'm no good at talking about the past.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I want you to help me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I've been his secretary for the past few years. That's why I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Know what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I know that he's changed a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Men change. They say a man can completely change in just three days.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not like that. Hmm⋯ How should I explain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He just changed. The way he acts toward me, the way he acts toward his mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His mother? That weird old lady?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't remember when, but we had a few conversations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she ask you to marry her son?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't make fun of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She said that he had changed, that he was almost unrecognizable. She said he started researching something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I study things that interest me sometimes.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Not like that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't get angry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji is obsessed with something. That might be the reason he's changed. That's what she said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]At some point, his mother changed too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did she change?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's hard to explain. I guess you could say she got more normal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Normal? But isn't that a good thing?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But she was so frightened⋯ She even came to me, his secretary, for help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she was just trying to understand her son's work?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm not sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Listen, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you want me to help you search for Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm lonely all by myself. Won't you help?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know he pointed a gun at me in another world.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And he stole the device I had with me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I thought Ryuuzouji was strange, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That being said, I don't know a damn thing about that guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But shouldn't I help Mitsuki now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think it's the same Ryuuzouji as my world, but I think they're related somehow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And maybe I can find out what happened to my father⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you so quiet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm thinking.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, there was one more strange thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, it's kind of weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lot of things are weird.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found part of a journal in Ryuuzouji's garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, his garden. It's pretty rare to have your own house in Japan, let alone a garden.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's an old storehouse in his garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is that strange?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, how could a new building already look so dilapidated?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not impossible. A movie crew could easily make a building look old quickly.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But, well, it's hard to explain. I want you to see it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* You're really asking a lot, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Won't you help?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have remedial lessons. I can't just go wherever I want whenever I want.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll mark you as present for your lessons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, let's do it then.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh, you were just trying to get something out of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Getting my fair share is my motto.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ha! You never change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Investigating Ryuuzouji can't hurt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what I'll find. It's kind of exciting.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But isn't it strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Read this portion of the journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll read what I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「So, here I found what is called⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯is it? Her proposition was very intriguing. It would be a great historical discovery.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A great discovery for history seems like a bit of an exaggeration. That is a little strange.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No. Read the next part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The next part? Here, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯terrifying. What kind of person is she⋯ask for my help?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯to me, that is something of Koudai's. I'm sure of it.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「If she has, then⋯terrifying⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The Koudai that's being talked about here. Is that–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man, yeah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I thought so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was supposedly good friends with Ryuuzouji. I'm not surprised he shows up in the journal.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Who is the 「she」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That I don't know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right, so that's what we don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She, huh⋯ Well, considering half the population is female, it's not really that surprising for a woman to be mentioned in the journal.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And look at the letters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The letters⋯love lett–[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know what I mean![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I didn't say anything.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I knew what you were going to say. It's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the letters?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Did you notice anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's handwritten, not typed like most people do nowadays.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]For some reason⋯his writing frightens me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That may be the case, Mitsuki, but⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you just ask him about it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The one who wrote this journal. That's the fastest way to get the information you want.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not my place to ask something like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But there is one thing that's different than before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He started smoking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smoking? You mean cigarettes?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. Not cigarettes. Cigars. He used to criticize smokers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Non-smokers become smokers all the time.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But he says he can't quit, like he's already addicted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, boy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't enough information to be sure this fragment even came from Ryuuzouji's journal.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm sure it did. He's showed me his journal before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The handwriting is his. I know that's certain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, so say it is Ryuuzouji's.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with the weird context?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Exactly. Haven't you noticed something's different about Ryuuzouji lately?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really know the guy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've only spoken to him recently.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji is different from before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is he different?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know how to explain it. It's like he's haunted by something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like in a horror movie?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Of course not. But he's different, preoccupied.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. He's probably just preoccupied with research.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, I wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think he is. Just the other day he took my old man's research papers from us, that's probably why he's been acting different.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But how does that explain everything else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Mitsuki worried about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You wanted to talk about Ryuuzouji, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, that's right. First take a look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's part of a journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A journal?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just read it first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were pretty late. Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I was busy sorting his paperwork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yep. But that's no excuse. I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't apologize. It makes me uncomfortable. It's fine, waiting didn't hurt me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's been a while since we've met alone like this. Almost a month, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it has been that long.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We used to stay at school and study like this a lot. Just the two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that and other things.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, other things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh boy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a bit further in. Let's see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, that sentence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯to me, that is something of Koudai's. I'm sure of it.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「If she has, then⋯terrifying⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I picked it up in Ryuuzouji's garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Garden? Like with chickens and stuff?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There aren't any chickens, idiot. Just a garden. Ryuuzouji's garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh. And?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea, as usual.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. You're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The writing is unusual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll give it a read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「So, here I found what is called⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I told you. It's part of a journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so damaged. I can hardly read it. You want me to read this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I want you read a little past there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A little past, um, here I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯is it? Her proposition was very intriguing. It would be a great historical discovery.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯terrifying. What kind of person is she⋯ask for my help?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't read it anymore.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right. Just read a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Mitsuki trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how I look at her, I still just see Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a while since we've stared at each other like this.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong with my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing at all! It's lovely and gorgeous.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah, same as always then. Ha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so mature.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair looks good cut in a bob with that slight wave to it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's something only a sophisticated woman could pull off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter what Mitsuki wears, it suits her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whether she's wearing casual clothes or professional, she always looks good.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course, independent women seem to make any clothes look good. Must be something about them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something stuck to the bulletin board.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you have any plans?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now isn't really the time to goof around.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What did I say?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I won't⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She yelled at me like I was a kid.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were trying to do something just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I wasn't trying to touch your breasts at all.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just as blunt as always, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nah, she'd just dodge me with that practiced ease anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Blouses that accentuate the bust are the best.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Buns? No. Biscuits, marshmallows? No. Rice balls?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ah! I just can't properly put this into words.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Are you hungry? Why are you talking about food?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, y-you heard me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her breasts are pressing against her blouse like two huge, pillowy rice balls.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a weird choice of words.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her voluptuous breasts are squeezed tightly within her blouse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I sound like a gross old man. This is pathetic.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really want to see those mountains, but this isn't the best time to be looking there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But my eyes are just drawn right to that spot. This is sad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm saying the same stuff I always do.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're always so frank. Seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just what I said. You're really forward. My eyes are up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm shameful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A little deeper. A little deeper. A little more![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Take a picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It'll last longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Yeah. Very funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's no good. I'd have to bend over like a perverted old man to get a good look at her skirt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, what if she sits on the desk in that short skirt? She sat!)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you stooped over all weird like that? Does your back hurt or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, but who has more adult charm, her or Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko has the body, but Mitsuki has the elegance.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're smiling a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Really?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were sizing up the goods, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're so bounc–I mean, of course not![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh, come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is, um⋯*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a book full of paper. I don't have to read it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a laboratory. It's got all the books and papers I could ask for.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We used to study here together a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such perfect skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Look at that desk Mitsuki is sitting on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only she were sitting on my lap instead⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's sitting up on the desk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only she were sitting on my lap instead⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mitsuki. She's such a mature, elegant woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a while since we've met like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the laboratory.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kinda nervous being alone like this with Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be using stuff.)[%p]
