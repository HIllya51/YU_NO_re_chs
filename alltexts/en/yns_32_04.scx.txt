[name]Eriko[line]I think I'm on to something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah⋯ Have you noticed anything about the storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like⋯what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Like something strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something strange inside the storehouse⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not it. Look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So maybe over there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it's not here⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You've been choosing strange places this whole time, don't you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if Ms. Eriko is talking about over there.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's strange about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing, I guess.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't strange⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The window isn't strange⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't think the window is very strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the window isn't strange.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You already knew that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I thought this was strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desk seems strange enough.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's strange about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dirty and rickety. You couldn't study at this desk if you tried.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Nobody studies here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think it's the book.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange. Look! There's S&M pictures in this![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You found something like that in here? Show me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it isn't this book⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I should bring this with me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I'm taking this rope.)[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Rope][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Rope][color index="800000"].
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. Let's see. Something strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is where the rope was hanging⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not there anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This doesn't seem like the right time to use that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something strange inside the storehouse. What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why would you reveal something so strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry⋯ I just gave into temptation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said there's something strange inside the storehouse⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll have you know, my breasts are above average.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think that's the point.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My breasts aren't strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. I just wanted to look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop before I get a fist to the face.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]From what I heard you sounded sincere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You heard, huh? Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess her face isn't strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your face is strange⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The next time you say something like that, you'll get a fist to the face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, I'm kidding![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's my arm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's so strange about such a smooth, beautiful arm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no reason to get upset⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have a nice body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I think I have a nice body⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look so sad.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right⋯ I'm surprised you noticed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The plaster over there is white, that looks strange.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Nailed it. Let's take a closer look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's right. This part of the wall is strangely white⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The plaster looks new⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does it mean?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why does it feel strange that the wall is only white here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if you were going to repaint, you'd do the entire wall, right? I doubt they ran out of funds halfway through.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly. Which means that this particular wall had some reason it needed to be repainted, but not the other walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that reason be?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I think I have an idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That being said, this is my area of expertise⋯ I wouldn't normally show something like this to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After all we've been through? I want to know more about Ryuuzouji too.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was a mistake to bring you here when you don't know anything about what's going on. Here, you'll–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know more than you think. I have information that even you might not know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, what do you know about Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ Let's review everything that's happened so far⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](One piece at a time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji is⋯[%p]
Normal gentleman
Not normal
[name]Takuya[line]He's a perfect gentleman.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The headmaster is a perfect gentleman⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, that's not right⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like I was wrong, but I shouldn't give up just yet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji is not an ordinary guy.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh? What makes you think that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm⋯ I'm about to explain myself.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯ Looks like I cleared the first hurdle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's next?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Recently, Ryuuzouji has been obsessed with something.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Interesting. What's his obsession?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, uh⋯[%p]
Affair with Mitsuki
Some kind of experiment
[name]Takuya[line]He was obsessed about his affair with Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, that's not it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* That's enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, I've saved the best for last.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to mess this up like an idiot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got to be careful⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was obsessed with his research.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. Headmaster Ryuuzouji has been preoccupied with his research⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know⋯ Uh, I mean, I definitely know what's he researching.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯ I nearly admitted that I don't have a clue about his research.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Think, Takuya. Think about everything you've learned so far⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Didn't I have some more information on Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What about⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's the matter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. Ryuuzouji moved to Sakaimachi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When was it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yuuki told me one day at the school gates.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was⋯)[%p]
Two months ago
One month ago
[name]Takuya[line]Two months ago![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One month ago![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, that's not it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whatever.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah that's it. Considering when Ryuuzouji moved here⋯[%p]
Something to do with the curse
Something to do with Ayumi
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like he has something to do with that curse.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're sharp. Maybe I was wrong about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something going on between Ryuuzouji and Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! That can't be right. I'm an idiot![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're the one who said it. You can't take it back now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just kidding. Ryuuzouji has nothing to do with Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But that's what you said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji seems to be connected to the curse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](People started talking about the curse at the same time Ryuuzouji moved here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was Ryuuzouji doing there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wasn't he devoted to his research?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, wait.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It wasn't just him⋯「She」 was guiding his research.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right, 「she」⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could it be?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong? Is that all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet. Yeah⋯ I think the 「she」 in Ryuuzouji's journal is some kind of clue.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph. So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah, Mitsuki said that last night⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji has been acting strange ever since the 「she」 from his diary appeared in his life.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 「she」 must be⋯[%p]
About Ryuuzouji's Mother
About Mitsuki
About Eriko
Still a mystery
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's mother, the old woman who hanged herself.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Haha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 「she」 is still a mysterious person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not quite it⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]At first, I also thought it would be someone close to the headmaster. But in the end, it's still a mystery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This 「she」 stumped me too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I thought that maybe it was Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But she was hypnotized. The only person who could perform hypnosis is the 「she」 from the diary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the 「she」 from the diary did that to Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. Ryuuzouji's mother died because she learned that secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, do you mean⋯[%p]
Committed suicide
Killed
[name]Eriko[line]You really think that was a suicide? Give me a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ It wasn't?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you think an old lady could toss a chain up to a crossbeam twice her height and hang herself on it with no stepping stool or anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that she mentions it, she's right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was murdered.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm surprised you noticed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First off, a little old lady wouldn't be able to hang herself on a crossbeam that high.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plus there wasn't even a stepping stool. Suicide just doesn't make sense.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I think the old lady may have discovered the secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She did?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, it's more than that. Her killer found out that she knew the secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A secret?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mhm, do you understand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a minute.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The pieces are coming together⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But there was more written in that journal⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just skimmed over it when I first read it, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, there was something strange written there. I'm sure of it.[%p]
Ryuuzouji's Remaining Days
Ryuuzouji's Mother
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah! It was written in the journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My body hurts⋯ My eyes hurt⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll die soon⋯ I can't even stand anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's mother is written about in so much detail⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, wasn't there something else written down somewhere?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, anyway.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's enough. As expected, it looks like you don't have much information.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, wait.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Come on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait a second![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Open up⋯please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's wrong. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]This is troubling. Breaking and entering, destruction of private property, and even theft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I, uh⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So you have an excuse, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I say? I don't think I can talk my way out of this.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. It appears there's another rat somewhere in the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll have time to hear your excuse later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](M-My head!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Agh!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](M-Mitsuki⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wh-Why⋯?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Just one more rat left inside.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, sir.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm⋯ It was very fortunate she could be taken care of here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, sir.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do the same with this brat.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could this mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything is⋯fading⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No good⋯ The ground is cold⋯ It feels⋯comforting.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So what's your conclusion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, that's completely insane.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But that's what my reasoning leads me to believe.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it's true, then inside this wall is⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing, I think I got it⋯ Just hear me out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside these walls⋯[%p]
Human
Treasure
[name]Takuya[line]Could be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯a treasure trove of silver and gold. Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, you had me there for a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. What I meant to say is⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're looking over there, right? It's hard to argue against the brilliance of a mere student, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, why don't we break down the wall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, this is the part where it'd say you'll have to stay tuned to see what's happens next.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If my reasoning is correct, then behind this wall⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Let's do it![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sound reverberates a lot inside the storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oof⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]One more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm starting to see something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's white, and it looks rigid.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I knew it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]One last swing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah!!![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I knew it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is th-that⋯ Wh-What I think it is?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Calm down. It's not going to attack us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But it's a skeleton![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes⋯ And it's only the head, hands, and feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just the head and limbs⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you notice something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a skeleton, but it's just the head, hands, and feet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Head, hands, and feet⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait. Doesn't that have something to do with the curse⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So you noticed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, though I wish I hadn't⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you remember the condition of the curse's victim?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Their head, arms, and legs had been ripped off⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's the case, then this is⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right, this is most likely that victim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who does this body belong to though?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You should already know. This skeleton⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Is me. Is that what you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯and Mitsuki?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki! Hey, Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's no use. She's hypnotized.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it that Niarb thing again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's keep the talking to a minimum, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, headmaster. How exactly are you going to explain this?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Explain what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The reason there's a skeleton in your wall.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You don't need to know. What are you two doing here, anyway?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, I was just on a little walk and accidently stumbled in.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]This storehouse was built 400 years ago. The body is most likely a remnant of the Tokugawa era.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's wrong. This storehouse was built six months ago. That's what Mitsuki said![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The jig is up, headmaster! Or should I say, #&□※![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What did she say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said something super bizarre.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I have no idea what you mean. Besides, we should be talking about this terrible sight.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Terrible sight?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Breaking and entering a private residence, destruction of private property⋯ These aren't exactly things a teacher should be doing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph, cheeky. Going to play dumb the whole time, are you?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was just thinking about taking you on.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Who, me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]For what reason?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know why better than anyone else.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know what you're talking about. I'm nothing more than the headmaster of Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How convenient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's unfortunate we didn't find the device.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The skeleton, your journal, the Niarb affliction, and the curse of this mansion⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They're all clues that point to a single object![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A gun?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](N-No⋯ It looks completely different from a normal gun.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko⋯ What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ Muahahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Say your prayers.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]When did you realize I was not myself?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When I heard about the rumor. The victim of the curse must have been the real Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯was the victim of the curse?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So those rumors about a beast⋯ That was Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means the Ryuuzouji in front of me is⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. You're a sharp one.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]While you kept him here, he would wander outside the mansion at night, begging people for help.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But when people saw his ghastly appearance, they were terrified. That's how the rumor about the curse began.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A limbless, headless body is hard to identify, and would only fuel such outrageous rumors of a curse. That would make it easy for you to dispose of the corpse, too.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There's no proof. This is all just conjecture.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have proof.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Like the journal your mother was holding when she died.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, I see⋯ Mitsuki has failed me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When the hypnosis wore off, Mitsuki must've used the last of her willpower to give the old woman the journal.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]To warn someone that I was not myself?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, very well then, it can't be helped.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I wanted to unveil the secrets hidden in this town and overcome the walls of even more events.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But that's all over now.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I shall do as you say. Violence isn't the answer.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's only one result. Give it up.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, but there's one thing you didn't notice.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That boy is another factor changing the event density.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Because of his father's inheritance, he was able to cross the Neumann boundary at will. Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's impossible![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is it? You should ask him.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I don't know anything⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you have a factor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you mean⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's something that doesn't belong in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something that doesn't belong in this world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I, uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji's putting his hand in his pocket.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is just like the time back at Triangle Mountain⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a gun in Ryuuzouji's pocket![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hahaha⋯ Die!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did he get me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't hurt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nothing feels out of place⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I read that the body will actually numb itself to an incredible amount of pain.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](However⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I heavy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like something's leaning on me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it's soft and warm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Gah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you just protect me and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He⋯told me something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't talk. Save your breath.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He said you're Takuya, but you're not Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But to me, you're⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki⋯ Hey! Hey!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're kidding. Wake up![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She's dead⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Damn⋯ Looks like he got away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He ran off? The bastard did this to Mitsuki and ran away?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He is cunning. Have you ever spoken alone with him for a long period of time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you⋯ Did you ever speak with him for a long period of time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Maybe once.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Look at me. Hmm⋯ Hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It looks like you're fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Who cares about me? Look at Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's heartbreaking, I know. But this ending was already decided.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean it was already decided?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, putting it scientifically, it's called fate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You knew that she would die?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why didn't you save her?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Even if Mitsuki hadn't been shot, the results would be the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I mean that the event potential flux is too high. This is an unavoidable event.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An unavoidable event?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. It's what we call 「fate.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seems you really don't belong here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm not sure of the particulars, but remember this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You, who wandered into this dimension, will be returned to your original place. You will go back to where you belong.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You may repeat the same things, but remember the subtle differences between events.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you meet another me, give her my regards.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, I guess you can't do that. You can't fight against causality. You might forget.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm getting⋯dizzy⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So it's begun. The powerful backlash of the laws of causality, the Chaos Correction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going to happen⋯to me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You'll go back to where you belong⋯ And I have to return to where I belong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯ I will remember Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Remember⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You should have forty to fifty hours before the correction.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you don't go back before then, the backlash will happen again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything's⋯turning⋯white⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My head hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My cheeks, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They sting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi pinching me again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Always pinch yourself when you wake up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is it⋯cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a bed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, this is where I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I crying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯a lot of tears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like something sad happened, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
