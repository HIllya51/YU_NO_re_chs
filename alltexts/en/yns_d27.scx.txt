[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Where would Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not in the city. I checked every shop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go look somewhere else![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, where would I go if I were Mio?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If anything happens, we should meet at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Yuuki said he was going to search around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is he looking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights. You can see all of Sakaimachi from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way Mio's father is home, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's Heights. You can see the whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My house is the big mansion on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. You're the daughter of the mayor, the most prominent person in the city.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't say it like that. I don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, let's just go.[%p]
