[name]Takuya[line]Dammit! I have to save Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the emblem got to do with it?! It doesn't matter![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes[%p]
[name]Man[line]What are you looking at? Look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are a couple guys holding Celes down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who are these guys?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're sneering at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](White armor?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're covered in sturdy armor.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]What are you looking at? Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're wearing some kind of creepy masks.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The masks completely block their faces from view.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]That's not where you should be looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like some kind of crest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something red painted on their hip.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]That's not where you should be looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's almost like a uniform.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means they must be from an army.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That armor looks pretty well-made, and they all match.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're pretty annoyed that I don't recognize the insignia.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]So? Are you surprised?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Are you telling me this symbol means nothing to you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't recognize it![%p]
[name]Man[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A red crest?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like it's important.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Where do you think you're going?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're not going to let me leave.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Where do you think you're going?![%p]
[name]Man[line]We've got something for you, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]We have to talk to you. Don't move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These guys sure are pushy.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Where do you think you're going?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]You don't know who we are?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, and I don't care! Let Celes go right now![%p]
[name]Man[line]Sheesh, whadda bumpkin. You'd better watch who you talk to like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Man[line]We are the Royal Guards of the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're from the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]According to record, the knight Illia should be here protecting the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯died.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]I see. Then you're useless to us. Leave. Now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, this is my house![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]So, the outsider's settled down in someone else's home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is my house. Celes is my wife![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]What?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya, no⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]Run! Get away from here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you don't let Celes go⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]Please, run![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! I can't take it anymore!!![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Halt![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Outta my way! I won't go easy on you![%p]
[name]Celes[line]It's no use. Run![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming, Celes![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]I'll admit, I like your spirit. But that's enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough what?![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Are you part of the rebellion against the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rebellion? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]The treasonous rebels who plan to overthrow the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So, there's a rebellion⋯)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]We're taking her to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way I'm letting you get away with that![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Get away with what? Are you suggesting we let this priestess get away with valuing her own desires above the welfare of the people?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her job as a priestess is over![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]She is a criminal. We're taking her with us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like hell! Don't you dare touch her![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Are you really in such a hurry to die? Fool.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]It was fun. I'll never forget you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]I love you.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]CELES![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]I can't believe it. The fool bit her own tongue off.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]She killed herself⋯ So ends the life of a lousy priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, answer me.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't be serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, answer me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes? Celes! Celes!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gaaahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bastards!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not a single one of you will leave here alive![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Idiot. You are unarmed and outnumbered. Do you really think you can take on the Royal Guard of the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You killed Celes!!![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]She killed herself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's dead all the same![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]You truly are a fool. You nearly escaped with your life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Clearly, she killed herself trying to save you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]I have no interest in a dead priestess. Shall we return to the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not if I can help it. I will kill every last one of you![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]You fool![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Raaaaahh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saying four years passed in no time is the best way I can describe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was such a mysterious woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She never spoke. She just trotted along after me like a lost puppy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Imperial Capital? And what the hell is a priestess?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her smell always brought back memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was⋯a scent from a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what did I feel for her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You, me⋯and Yu-No. It will always be the three of us.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((It's all right. I'll protect you⋯and Yu-No, too.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'll protect you⋯))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad⋯ Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Ah, Dad![%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, wake up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aah, thank goodness. You're okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ I couldn't protect you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯ Where's your mother?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She's outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Outside?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]There were some scary people with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯ Is she still alive?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did they do to her?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]They buried her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Buried her?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What do you mean they buried her?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]They sent her back to the earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not one of them will leave here alive. Gaah![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! I can't move.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Stay still. You're really hurt, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is the back of my head wet?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You're losing a lot of blood, Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Blood?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Stay still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So they beat me.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes⋯)
[name]Royal Guard[line]((Fool. You thought you could fight us. Ha!))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((What should we do now that she's killed herself?))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((A priestess should be returned to the earth with reverence.))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((What do we tell the God-Monarch when we return?))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((If there were someone who could replace this priestess⋯))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((A successor, someone who shared her bloodline.))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((For now, we will inform the God-Monarch. Then we will await our orders.))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((Hm⋯))[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]((A successor⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)
[name]Takuya[line](I couldn't protect Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Liar! You said you'd always protect her!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You worthless bastard!!!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You should have died with her!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](With Celes!)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad! Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah. Yeah, I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What will I do if you pass out again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm okay, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, really.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on now, don't cry like that. Your pretty face will get all blotchy.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The tears⋯feel nice.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, *cough* I'm still alive.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'm alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. I'm alive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm still alive!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I will live.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I will survive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And then, I'll crush those men from the Imperial Capital!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll make that high and mighty God-Monarch bow before me!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right⋯ What am I doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to mourn with Yu-No. I'm barely holding it together.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know I have to be the strong one, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her headstone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is buried right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got rid of the stone those bastards from the Imperial Capital put up. I made this one myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been two days, and I can finally think straight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For two days, Yu-No and I mourned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No hardly ate anything. Even that lizard, Kun-Kun, lost its appetite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Yu-No didn't cry. At least, not in front of me. She's strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I can't let on how upset I really am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be comforted by my own daughter⋯ Ha! Celes would smile at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to find out why those guys tried to take you away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said it was for some kind of ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was supposed to save the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Save the world? Does that mean your death doesn't matter, Celes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't deserve to die for the choice you made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sacrifice a few to save the whole. That's what they'd say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Machiavellian bastards⋯ It makes me sick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet they happen not to be among those who get sacrificed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's how it always is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll make their God-Monarch explain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it had better be a good explanation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯ I'll make them grovel in the dirt and apologize to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If not⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know it would make you sad to hear me talking like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'd probably make that face and ask me to stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop⋯ That's exactly what the look on your face would say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this is non-negotiable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't compromise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good-bye, Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, things should be ready by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's head home⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go ahead. Keep running your mouth! What gives you the right to touch Celes?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Who is Celes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The woman you and your buddies are holding down![%p]
[name]Man[line]You mean Sayless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sayless?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Yesterday, a messenger bird arrived with word from the knight, Illia. The message was written four years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Messenger bird⋯from Illia?[%p]
[name]Man[line]The message claimed the priestess Sayless was here and that Illia intended to care for her. It was dated four years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see. The letter Celes found⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! How could I have been so stupid?!)[%p]
[name]Man[line]That was her last wish, but now, she can never fulfill her role as a priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]The fact that she spoke, the fact that she had sex with a man. She was corrupted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean corrupted?![%p]
[name]Man[line]She abandoned her duty to chase her selfish desires. A priestess has no right to do that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who the hell are these guys?!)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Before you question who we are, take a good look at us![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Take a good look at what?)[%p]
[name]Man[line]First, take a good look at us.[%p]
[name]Man[line]There's no way even a bumpkin like you doesn't know who we are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is he telling me to look?)[%p]
