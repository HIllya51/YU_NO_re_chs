[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get this painkiller to Ayumi as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The downtown area is full of various shops and tons of neon signs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess I should buy it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The drugstore is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The downtown area is full of various shops and tons of neon signs.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I should follow him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The downtown area is full of various shops and tons of neon signs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big bank in Sakaimachi. It's called Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's closed now. If I come back during the day, I might be able to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A Saikyou staff member will come out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting tired of doing stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Just one more time.[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi. A salesperson?[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]I'm Suzuki of Saikyou. Nice to meet you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Suzuki of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, Suzuki may be the strongest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go in one more time?[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]Hi. Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi.[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]I am the receptionist for Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go inside for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]Hi. Welcome. Welcome to Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi. Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]I'm the branch manager of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The branch manager of Saikyou. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does the sign say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Bring your money in right away!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Powerful staff are waiting for you.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Saikyou Bank?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In such a big city, it's not surprising that there are a couple of banks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tree-lined street in front of me leads to the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the tree-lined street downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The look of the city changes considerably between spring, summer, fall, and winter. It's a nice view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boutique.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a French boutique selling women's clothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boutique, not a drugstore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boutique. I don't need anything from this shop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a boutique in this building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi buys clothes at this store fairly often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are various buildings lined up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the downtown area, neon signs are shining late into the night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an ordinary building. There's no drugstore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's under the signs over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are various buildings lined up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a long row of buildings downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area is mainly shops and offices, and the residential area is to the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is a signboard that stands out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coffee shop itself is quite large and relaxing, so it's perfect for meetings and killing time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright sign.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the sign for the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's bright lights make it impossible to see the stars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I look like a lunatic staring up at the sky all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky stretches on forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the building won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I need to get this painkiller to Ayumi as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! My house is that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did I come here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious about Toyotomi. I should head home right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Toyotomi didn't go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just got downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't imagine she would be at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go over just in case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'm supposed to meet Yuuki at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The last time I saw him was there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I saw that bastard Toyotomi too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll head to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really have anything to do here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the residential area, so there aren't any shops here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just don't trust that guy. And I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm following Toyotomi to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That road leads up to the Heights. It's got a great view of the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a few parks where men and women like to hook up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that's the hotel where Kaori lives.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check out the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm wondering about something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Yuuki's territory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I check out some other places?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go to the hotel right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I have to do at the hotel?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the hotel, not the drugstore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do at the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go there alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi didn't go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toward the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go, I want to go with a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go there. I can sleep at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll check inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Mio is here, but just in case⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As the name implies, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll check one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take a look just in case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that woman Kaori were in this caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko was watching that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The drugstore is below the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Old man![%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]I'm not an old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry. May I please have a painkiller that's good for headaches?[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]What kind of headache?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean 「what kind of headache」?[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]Hey, young man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What⋯[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]There are a lot of different kinds of headaches. Even if you gave me a partial explanation, I probably couldn't help you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe a hangover, but I haven't been there for two days⋯[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just have to ask you to do it.[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]That's too vague. I can't sell you something based on that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't this a drugstore?[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]That's right. But if I sell you the wrong medicine, I'll have to listen to you complain about it later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Customer[line]If it really is a hangover, this one is good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who this is. She is beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Female Customer[line]This works. Take this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]What are you gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then, I guess I'll take this.[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]That'll be twenty dollars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Twenty dollars? Isn't that a bit much?[%p]
[name]Female Customer[line]It might be a bitter pill to swallow, but good drugs are expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, then. Here ya go.[%p]
[name]Saleswoman[line]Thanks. I hope it works.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is with this shop?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At least I got the medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did that woman go? I need to thank her properly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like she went inside that caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's a seedy drugstore belowground, but I've never been there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, whatever. I don't feel like having tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am already at a coffee shop. Now I am worried about the crowd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I follow him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's that coming out of there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Toyotomi, isn't it? Is he meeting someone at the caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just return this picture to him and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's strange. There are two other people with Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting a weird vibe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strange. They look like gangsters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Toyotomi with those guys? And what are they whispering about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's odd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was walking towards the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something just⋯bothers me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The building over there is a major downtown coffee shop called the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As the name implies, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
