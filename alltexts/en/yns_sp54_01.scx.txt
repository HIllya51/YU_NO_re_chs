[name]Takuya[line]This is Celes's cooking. I'm hungry, so let's eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes is sitting right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should eat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A meal for just the two of us.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's sort of relaxing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just what kind of person is she, exactly?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can she smile even now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like she's enjoying herself.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can she possibly smile like that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gotta eat while you can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So let's eat.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](For the time being, it seems like we can eat this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gotta eat while you can. My dad always used to tell me that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He was right. You never know where your next meal might come from.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes made this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's still some food in the storehouse that Illia left behind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I still don't know what's edible and inedible around here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't just go around picking random grass and eating that, after all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's why I'm eating what she makes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must have been really hungry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Considering you made this for me, I'll eat it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to sleep![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But before that, I should eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I already ate enough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All I want after that is a goodnight's sleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I already ate enough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](After filling your stomach, the next thing that comes⋯)[%p]
My libido is through the roof.
I can't keep my eyes open⋯
[name]Takuya[line](⋯is the need for sex.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm feeling so hot right now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I wish I had the energy to say that. Ha ha ha.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm tired, so the only thing I need is some sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I did run all over the place today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm completely exhausted.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa-ho-ho, Celes was right next to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should watch what I say.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You went into the forest all alone, without telling me?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could you?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I told you not to go out by yourself![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sob*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't forget what happened to Illia, did you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would you have done if something happened to you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, I don't claim to know everything⋯but if you know I'm here to protect you, start acting like it.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sob*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is with you, anyway?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you just going to stay here and never go home?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me tell you something.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just because nothing's happened in the last week doesn't mean I've given up on trying to get home.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't just stay here dilly-dallying all day, after all. I still⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯try to be careful from now on.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was a little harsh. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk, oh well.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, these nuts are really good![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The way you cooked it was absolutely amazing. Maybe I can get some more the next time I go to the forest.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You cook so well, Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*blush*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Man. What am I even doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's good, but I just don't feel like eating that much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She'll probably be sniffling if I don't.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sorry, but I just don't feel like eating.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, I've been wandering here and there for the past week.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like the phrase 『searching in vain』 was made just for me.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay! I'm eating.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just not hungry right now.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone gets a little homesick sometimes, right?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's exactly how I feel right now.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've been waiting for me every day this week. Just what are you hoping for?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's pretty pointless questioning someone that doesn't talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I get that, but I just want to talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm eating. I mean, isn't there any bread or corn soup in this world?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Corn soup has yellow corn all mashed up in it to make a thick soup.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I even have to explain this?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, actually this food⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did we have this stored in the house?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's on the table.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it isn't from Illia's stock supply⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*point point*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why are you pointing at yourself?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait. Did Celes get these?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*munch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*chew*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is with you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Jeez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thinking everything's all peachy. Doesn't she know how I feel?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I to gain by getting angry at her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm so homesick that I don't even want to do anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ack! *cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for smacking my back.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This time she laughed at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is stupid. I should just stop it and eat my food.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grrr⋯ Hmph![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tremble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something is funny about this, though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grrr⋯ Hmph![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's getting startled. I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no point in me taking it out on her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's getting frightened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You idiot![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nothing will come from me taking it out on her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just eat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You know, I'm not really in the mood for messing around like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I already yelled. Just give me a break.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]YES, DRILL SERGEANT!!![%p]
[name]Celes[line]?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing. Everyone needs to scream sometimes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she's been convinced.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sorry, but I just don't feel like making jokes right now.)[%p]
