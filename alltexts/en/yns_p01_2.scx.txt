[name]Takuya[line]I'm in bed, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't seem to fall asleep⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's the school physician at Sakaimachi Academy, and my class's homeroom teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She smokes a lot and talks like a man. A pretty tough woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She lived abroad for a long time, so she doesn't really think like us locals.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She asked what was the style nowadays, then went ahead and got right on board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We told her that tight dresses, miniskirts and thongs were in. The next day, she showed up wearing just that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might just be susceptible to trends. Hmm, it's kind of funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't seem like a teacher. It's like she's more approachable. She's different from all the other teachers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really like her, actually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not the most normal person, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I really like her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That junior in my club always hanging around me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I helped him out once when he got involved with some bad kids.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's stuck around ever since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd never really had a close friend before he came around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My homeroom teacher said I started being more cooperative and outgoing. I guess some of that was thanks to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ever since he met her, he's been trying to catch up to that girl⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not much of my concern anymore, which isn't really bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But of all people, he's into that girl⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My club junior.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He makes some jokes to lighten the mood, but I wish he'd stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio Shimazu.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That stuck-up princess is always making jabs at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her grades are always perfect, and she's gorgeous. Beauty and brains, as they say. Describes her perfectly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only she'd be more honest with herself⋯but that would make her too perfect, it wouldn't be interesting at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say God doesn't give three gifts, so maybe that's good enough for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki also said she only ever gets cross with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would she get cross with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't know. Well, maybe there's one reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She did witness me in that one situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was working as a part time history teacher until recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's really a nice, mature woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She had been working as Ryuuzouji's secretary until she began her part time job as a teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People liked her classes because they were so easy to understand. Such a shame.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's still much more, maybe too much more⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of things I should mention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's Ryuuzouji's secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's really a nice, mature woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's apparently the headmaster at Sakaimachi Academy, the school I go to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man said they were best friends, as well as research partners in historical science.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Half the reason I went to that school is because my old man recommended it. I'm sure that bastard just wanted his friend to take care of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A research partner, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of research they were doing together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could have sworn he worked with my old man on one of the books he published.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it wasn't just the two of them. There were three⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember there being a third person that published that book together with them. I forgot their name⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a woman, wasn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, something was mentioned about my old man during lunch today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think something was said. What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((We spoke over the phone, but is there anything that he⋯or she left behind?))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((It doesn't have to be addressed to me specifically.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, he asked about “he” or “she”⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean my father left something behind?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know there are still books in his study. His study is right next to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look over it tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Headmaster Ryuuzouji. My old man's best friend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, I should get some sleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*zzz⋯zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who am I kidding, I can't sleep that well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is no use, I can't get to sleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*snore⋯snore*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm hungry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Uh oh, I was making that snoring sound and now my stomach is in sync. It's making me hungry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's not make any fake snoring sounds. It makes my tummy growl in sync.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]*grumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ My stomach is growling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just ignore it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ignore it. Just ignore it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm dizzy, but I'm not sleepy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aggghh! Shut up! I can't sleep![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I never thought skipping dinner would come back to bite me in the ass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Dammit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm so hungry that I'm dizzy, yet I feel wide awake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What an absurd system my body has.[%p]
