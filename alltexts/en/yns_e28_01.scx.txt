[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is close to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that necklace you're wearing important to you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]How did you know that, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well that's because⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It just seemed that way when I saw it on you, shining in the light of the school infirmary as you slept.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's important to you, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]If I lose this, I'll die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Die?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I get it. That's how important it is to you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why are you so interested in this necklace?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just thought it was beautiful, that's all.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]We're near the fountain, so we should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This gemstone will deteriorate if it touches water. That's why I can't go near the fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you put it in water it⋯deteriorates? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, how are you feeling?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You fainted twice yesterday. That's why I ask how you're feeling today.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm fine. Relatively speaking, for today⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Glad to hear it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you always like that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grumpy.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm not grumpy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes you are.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This is normal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You looked really cute smiling in that picture though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you actually can smile, huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I can't believe you snuck a look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought maybe I shouldn't, but I did anyway.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is that why you're interested in me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's part of it. But not all.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What else is there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about you makes me curious.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What about me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to say, but I just feel so excited around you. I feel it all the time, recently.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean that in a weird way. It's a strange feeling.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's just your imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you ever feel that way?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I-I really don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like you stuttered there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I did not![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, if you say so.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why don't you ask me any more questions?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you answer if I asked?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If my old man⋯ If that old bastard did anything to you, I take full responsibility.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]He's not that kind of person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would a girl like Kanna know about my old man?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You don't know much about your own father, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I know him. He's a pervert with no principles. He has no right being called a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm leaving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you for your help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to thank me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm sorry. Thank you. Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna! Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know my own old man, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does Kanna know that I don't?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many things I want to ask her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That ended on a pretty awkward note though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she was trying to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna already left so there's no point in me staying here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to head back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A little puppy. How cute.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't have a collar, so it must be a stray. Someone around here must have let it loose.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big societal problem. There are lots of people who get pets but can't take care of them, so they turn them loose.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Humans are so selfish. They buy animals thinking they're so cute, then get bored with them and toss them on the street.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I think humans are selfish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From an environmental conservation standpoint?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm not involved with any activists.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say that, but you were pretty angry with the construction director.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I said that for their own sakes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, what goes around comes around. So environmental destruction would eventually cause them problems.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm not involved with any activists.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's nuzzling up to you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe he thinks you're his mom.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm⋯no mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell that to me. Tell it to the puppy.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I⋯am not very fond of animals.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Because I hate them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sounds logical.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I ask why?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't force you to talk.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm sure humans would be much happier enjoying their lives without thinking much about anything, like this puppy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you'd say that not thinking brings you happiness, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I didn't say that. However, you could live without anger, worry, sadness or loneliness that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But life is so fun because we have anger and sadness. They can make happiness seem that much better, too.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Only someone who hasn't experienced true anger and sadness can say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](True anger and sadness?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you've gone through that, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I've been betrayed, hated⋯ I'm done with all of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, this little guy really seems like he's not thinking about anything. He's working on nothing but love.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He really likes you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No he doesn't. This dog has no idea what kind of human I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of human are you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm⋯not who you think I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you think I think about you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's not fair. You ask me all the questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. I'll stop.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯he left.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]He must have gotten bored of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was really into you though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Puppies have an innate ability to differentiate between good people and bad people.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's not true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I've never met a person like you before, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're so hard to figure out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're one to talk.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why didn't you do anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't do what? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, did you get hurt?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, but I've never met someone like you before, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to interpret that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's never met a guy too pussy to make a move?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's basically insulting me⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You look angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, no I'm not. Hahaha. I'm laughing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of which, you barely ever smile.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is that so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you give me a big smile?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll just have to make you laugh then. *tickle tickle*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]All men say the same thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, some pervert said stuff like that to you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I guess that pervert would be me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmn, so close. I was right there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Do you get some kind of benefit from making me laugh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me happy.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sometimes I laugh just looking up at the sky.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's just like⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to finish that thought. Whenever I do that, girls always gather around and whisper stuff about me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you smiled a little bit.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I did not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes you did.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I did not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. Can you say that looking me straight in the face?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't they say that a smile is like lubricant for the heart?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Who says that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do, anyway.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're strange, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not as strange as you are.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How peaceful.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Birds are singing, the fountain is glistening, kids and their mothers are playing on the side. What other word besides 「peaceful」 could you ever use to describe this?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It might look like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. Do you think otherwise?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You never know when the birds may be targeted by predators. The fountain is simply a pardon for the people who destroy nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Our lives rest on a strangely tense balance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, you have a point.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's not a point. It's the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talking about the truth now? That's incredible.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look at me like that. It's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I think seeing things as peaceful is better than not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Children playing with their parents⋯ It's a peaceful scene.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It does look peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like you have a little spite to your words.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can hear children laughing in this park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how many people are here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of moms with their kids here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has a shadow cast over her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what she's thinking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I probably shouldn't mess with her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to hear more from her anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*yawn*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sometimes I don't understand the things you do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw, was that a compliment?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't give me that look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beautiful hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd probably feel good to comb through with my fingers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair, there on her shoulder⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She says this is a pardon for environmental destruction.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a fountain.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's a pardon for environmental destruction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a fence here so people don't fall in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wouldn't make much of a difference if you just climbed over it. I guess it keeps people from falling in by accident.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is something the matter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should try talking to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what she's thinking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
