[name]Takuya[line]This is the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My homeroom teacher, Ms. Eriko, is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It's so cool in the infirmary.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You come to sleep here all the time, so I have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hate sleeping alone. I bet it'd be fun if you slept with me, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't be stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff* So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's my line.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I know how you think.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That reminds me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, what kind of student calls their teacher by their first name?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you call students by their first names.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's because I'm your advisor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, my money pays your salary.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just kidding. So have you seen Mitsu- I mean, Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You could have just started by asking me that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯ You haven't seen her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I thought she was substituting for someone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know that, but I heard she wanted to talk to me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder where she is.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, Ichijou is Headmaster Ryuuzouji's secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I hear.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wonder if you know something about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Rumors maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? Are you considering a job as a gossip columnist?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's my job to keep an eye on the students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Anyway, have you heard any rumors like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not really interested in listening to gossip.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh. You're that type. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if something happened to Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff* You have remedial classes tomorrow, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, it's going to be a long summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The school infirmary is filled with a weird smell.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, it is the school infirmary. I guess if it smelled like beef bowls or something, that'd be a problem.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](With the air conditioning going, it's pretty comfortable in here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, the school physician, is my advisor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you looking?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's exactly what I mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She has a nice body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The cigarette in her mouth is Ms. Eriko's trademark.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't say it like that. To make matters worse, the guidance counselor is watching me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is with her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just puffing away in front of a student. What a strange teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grrrr⋯ Woof![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sometimes I really don't understand you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'd better stop before I end up as some kind of deviant.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I think you're already there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I'll just go outside.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you see Ichijou, can you tell her I want to speak to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you just tell her yourself?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I think you'll see her first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm counting on you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does she want to talk to her about?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That goes inside the cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was really tight in there.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come here![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't understand people like you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, maybe it's pink today.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm talking about the color of your shoes, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you think I was talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*clack clack* *rumble rumble*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing to that drawer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't really think logically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really don't want to go outside yet.[%p]
