[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a perfectly normal mountain of rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An awful lot of grass here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing but a bunch of grass growing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing to look at here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I dunno who it was, but it looked like they were bent down to the ground, checking something out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were they examining?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of grass growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anything strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, it's just a normal rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something carved into it. It was too dark to see properly though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like some kind of symbol.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fact that something is carved in the rock isn't weird. I used to draw on the walls and ground when I was a kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However⋯this is the shrine, where that lady was bent down before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it means something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A woman at Triangle Mountain, and symbols carved into the rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mio! Don't scare me like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm the one that's surprised. You'll give me a heart attack screaming like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though you're the one with nerves and buns of steel?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, it wasn't as bad as when your dad came into the room.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about? It was a lot worse after you left. He asked me a ton of questions about if there was someone hiding in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think it was worse for you?! You pushed me out the window head first.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It took a lot of work to get my dad off my back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, whatever. There's no use in talking about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was pushed straight out the window and⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind. (She sounds scary.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What were you doing just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It looked like you were investigating something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uhh⋯ I thought there was a lady over there just now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Feeling a little frustrated down there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's stupid.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seemed like she was bent down looking for something over there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, just like that⋯huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's Hatano.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna? What is she doing?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's take a closer look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A closer look? H-Hey, don't pull me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Dragging me into the shadows like this? You've gotten bold, Mio.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Don't be such an ass.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((She's looking at something on the right side of the rock.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Something⋯ What could it be?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((I don't know. It looks like she's touching it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Is she grabbing and massaging it?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Shut up, idiot!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Who are you calling an idiot?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((You're giving me a headache.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Okay, I'll rub your chest to make you feel better.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((If you do anything creepy, you'll get a sock for it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((A sock? I'd rather have a pair of your panties.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Arima, do you seriously want to get your butt kicked?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((No.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I can't just sit in the shadows and spy on this girl.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((But she's acting suspicious.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I think we're pretty suspicious hiding behind this rock.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Oh, look.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Mm, I saw it. Way to go, Mio.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((What the heck are you looking at?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You're on all fours, I have to look, even if I don't want to.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((What do mean you don't want to?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Don't worry, it's a very nice view.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((That's worse!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Oh⋯))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Don't even try to get out of this now.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Shut up, she's coming this way.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Huh? No way.))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Good evening, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, uh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Say something. Lie if you have to.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem. Ummm⋯ What a coincidence, seeing you here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((That's so unnatural. You suck.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Shut up. What am I supposed to say?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Think for yourself. Be a man.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You should really quit being so sexist⋯))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't think you should come here very often. It's best for everyone to stay away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What were you doing over there?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I was just out for a breath of fresh air.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Liar. We were watching you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mio, try being a little nicer.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shut up, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We were watching you. We saw you crouched down over there, doing something.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What was I doing?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I didn't feel too well, so I sat down.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is there something wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. I don't believe it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Then what kind of answer will make you happy?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You're at a disadvantage, Mio.))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]May I go home now?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why would you ask me that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'll be going then. Goodnight, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See you tomorrow at school.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you sound so angry?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What was that about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was what about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]「See you tomorrow at school」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're so unfair! Why didn't you help me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's unfair about what I said?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because⋯ She's clearly hiding something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know that for sure.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I mean, what if she was?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you going to do about it? Torture the answers out of her?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she doesn't want to talk, you can't make her.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But I think there's something not right about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'd say that she's not-not-all right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's a strange way to put it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a reasonable way to explain the current situation.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm going to go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just did. There's nothing particularly–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Nothing at all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There are cuts here that look like someone carved with a knife.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You knew about that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, I thought this was the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What place? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Idiot. This is the exact spot that matches the location marked on the tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tapestry?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wonder if Hatano was checking that out, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would Kanna be looking for though?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You call her Kanna? When did you two get so close?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hatano was often at the coastline asking the construction director to stop the construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she wanted the construction to stop, maybe she's related to someone who died in the accident.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No. I thought the same thing at first. But that doesn't seem to be the case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Maybe I should ask her again tomorrow. It might have something to do with that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Or that painting⋯ Oh yeah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the matter?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I forgot to copy that dial.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Man, she always does whatever she wants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although, Kanna does act pretty strange sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's only been one month since she transferred.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right around when the old bastard died.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or, I should say when we found out he died.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a minute.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The lightning accidents started happening a month ago, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a strange coincidence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or is it a coincidence at all?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're looking very serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sorry, but when I get focused on something I don't notice anything else. I didn't mean to ignore you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, that's not it. I was just thinking about something else.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]About Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-You can't be serious. How ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she blushing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It must be my imagination. It is night, after all.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're interested in Sword Cape, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I never expected you to say something like that, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, you laughed at me that one time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't laughing at you. I was laughing at my old man's theory.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Instead of standing around, why don't we go to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'd like to sit down for a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've kind of been wanting to have a heart to heart with Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](In more than one way.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't complain like that when you sit down.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This feels great. The stars are beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But the ocean is so dark it feels like I could get sucked in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you mind if I watch the ocean for a while?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have something to tell me, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So do I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal rock. Nothing strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is just normal grass. It's not going to turn into a bucket no matter how many times I look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, want to graze on it like a cow?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass growing in the gaps between the rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal, rocky area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing out of the ordinary about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is, what was she doing here, bent down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure she was bent down right around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not climbing up, that's for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe I should say I can't climb up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, someone went rock climbing here a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He fell and got badly injured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was said something sparked right in front of his eyes and he lost consciousness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The locals around here said it was a curse from the gods. Thinking about the wrath of gods makes me think about lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earthquakes, lightning, and fires. Oh my![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These craggy rocks are sticking out all over the place. Makes me want to climb it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain. It's pointed up to the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something more to this rocky mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, why don't I look around a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
