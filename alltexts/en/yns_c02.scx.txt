[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, are you here?! Answer me please![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet. I can't hear a single sound.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I'll have to look inside the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, Ayumi's shoes are here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means she must be home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should go into the living room and⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's another pair of shoes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're men's dress shoes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They look pretty fancy, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can only think of one fancy-pants guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's him. Toyotomi is here.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey⋯wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Ayumi!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be⋯?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It came from the living room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A-Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she in the living room with Toyotomi?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Listen⋯ Toyotomi⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Chief⋯ No, I shouldn't call you that anymore. Do you mind if I call you by your name?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mm⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I've been waiting for this for so long![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ahhh!!! I⋯oh![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You don't dislike it enough to actually say stop, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're⋯right⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You'll be fine as long as I'm here. I'll remove all the doubt that's been cast upon you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Geo Technics has labelled you a thief and a traitor.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But maybe I can do something about that. I think I know how to find that stupid thief⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi⋯mm⋯ I thank⋯you⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, I'm sure you do. If you didn't, your family might have to live on the streets.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya would⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Are you concerned about him?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Of course I am! He's my stepson.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No, you've been giving him too much attention.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Is it that he looks so much like your late husband?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please, Toyotomi. Not now⋯ He'll be home soon.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]How about showing him? Sex education is important, after all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]D-Don't be ridiculous![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But you let me in. Didn't you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, where is it? You'll let me, your partner, in on the secret, won't you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Where's⋯what?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't play dumb. The 20th document page.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I need it tonight. I'm going to use it to negotiate with those damned thieves.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If I don't have it, I won't be able to help you. Now where is it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯lost it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ayumi, are you really going to say that after coming all this way?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I-I did, in front of the office building⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If I don't have it, I won't be able to help you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That scumbag Toyotomi is spewing nothing but lies!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! I can't take it anymore!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi!!![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What⋯ Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No⋯no!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, look at her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That bastard Toyotomi was trying to⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why⋯ Why are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? I was trying to⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Leave. Please leave now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi, I⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh man, what a brash, unromantic guy you are. You just don't know how to be patient, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! I won't forgive all of your lies and bullshit![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Lies? Where's your proof that I'm lying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The note she left says she'll be home late because of work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you home yet?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's home right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ What am I gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
*ring⋯ring*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's home right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't home yet. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's home right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is at work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange⋯ I can't find her anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Hmm⋯ Hm hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it coming from?[%p]
Hmm⋯ Hm hmm⋯ Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There it is again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it came from the bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be? I'll go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know the washing machine is in there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We have a high-tech washing machine that washes our clothes in some intricate way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I even explaining that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Here we are, the bathroom⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's some kind of garment on my foot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's really small. I wonder what it is?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Two small holes and one relatively big hole.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Th-This is her underwear! Thank god I noticed, I was about to sniff it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ever since I was young I've had a habit of sniffing at unfamiliar things.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I even explaining that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If there's a pair of underwear here, then there must be⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I-I know I shouldn't.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I can't resist it.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm hm hm hmmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi, taking her usual morning bath.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She takes a bath every morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's already lunch time, so I didn't think she'd be in the bath right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hahaha, there was no need to panic at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I laughing at?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's my stepmother. What am I doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I say that, yet I can't bring myself to leave. I can't believe myself.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯ I feel kind of pathetic now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Guess I'll go back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!)[%p]
*ring⋯ring*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she going to see me?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Squish and squash for pretty silky hair⋯ Hehehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah. It's kind of hard to hear the phone while in the bathroom.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And on top of that, she's washing her hair right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew, that was close.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not something I should feel so lucky about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should go get the phone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's ringing so loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She didn't leave a note this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She didn't pick up the phone, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the living room, but now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi still sleeping?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I have to do today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, don't you? I need to make sure I meet with that bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got to ask him about what went down at the park last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, Ayumi is sitting at the counter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayu⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems a little off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks so weak⋯like she has no energy at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't take this anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not home yet. I'm getting worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm past worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting a really bad feeling. Did something happen to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi went out somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wouldn't leave without saying something to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she leave a note somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she go out in that condition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really doubt it. She must be in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll bring this headache medicine to Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, just bringing the headache medicine won't do much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll pour some water into a cup and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That should be good. I'm going to Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, it's me, Takuya.[%p]
⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, are you asleep?[%p]
⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's in the bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house isn't a drugstore, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already 9pm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She usually comes out to welcome me home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means she probably isn't home right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already nine at night, though. I wonder what's up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nine o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't that lady, Kaori, say something would happen at nine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already 8pm. She said she'd be home early.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's⋯seven o'clock now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Ayumi said she'd be going to the TV station around seven.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I have to head out to the office again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You got a call from work?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, I'm so sorry. And we were right in the middle of a conversation. Dr. Ryuuzouji took all of the documents from the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you gave all of them away?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, it was a joint research project after all. It's only natural for him to take the documents, now that your father can't continue the research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew⋯ That was hard work. There was so much dust everywhere. I'm really glad I cleaned though.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew! Losing the key to the study made it really hard to get the door open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key to the study?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. The key actually broke. I'll have to call the locksmith to come fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We'll discuss it more later, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯ I must have been mistaken.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't skip your remedial classes, but if you're tired then make sure you rest. Don't work too hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was definitely Ayumi. It couldn't have been anyone else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might not be the same woman I know. That's possible, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, thinking about all the possibilities is tiring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? She isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you home?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. She hasn't come home yet.[%p]
