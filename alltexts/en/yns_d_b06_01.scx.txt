[name]Takuya[line]The path is forked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The left path is a dead end with a rock blocking the exit.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]If we go to the right, it leads to another fork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The left path is a dead end.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's where the boulders are blocking the path.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. The same place as that strange pattern engraving⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The right path leads to another fork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll have to proceed very carefully.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please be careful, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should we go?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll leave it all to you, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looking at it another way, he means he takes no responsibility.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well, I'll decide.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's damp here too, just like everywhere else.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Water keeps dripping from the ceiling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the humidity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be from the water dripping down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
