[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not even 10pm yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's been a long time since I've seen you, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You make it sound like I'm never around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's exactly what I'm saying.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough* What are you doing to me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's enough talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out on a walk again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, over to that samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, the samurai mansion, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Can we resume what we talked about yesterday?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]About Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's a lot about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems so serious all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear the voices of club students inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]School at night is meant for ghost stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, there's someone at the front gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing I need to hide from. It was just a natural reaction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a girl. She's wearing a uniform, so is she a student here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯it's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's she doing at the front gate by herself?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she's waiting for someone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But for who?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe her boyfriend?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did Kanna have a boyfriend though?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, she might be dating someone in secret.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I do hear she has lots of guy friends.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those are just rumors though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does she really have that many guy friends?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't explain it that well, but I just don't think that's the case.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've never seen her talk to a single person in class.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, you can't judge a book by its cover.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if she's into older men?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She might not even be able to stomach the idea of dating a guy the same age as her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's been standing there for a while.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is she waiting for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know if it's her boyfriend or whatever, but I can't forgive them for making her wait for so long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I talk to her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing out here by yourself?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meeting somebody?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I'm waiting for someone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I saw you hanging around for a while, so I came over to see what's up.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you for your concern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoever is keeping you this long is obviously not very faithful. I wonder who it is?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I've been waiting to see you. Am I inconveniencing you right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Me? *thump thump*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not! I'm so amazed I'm nearly crying.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't say that so seriously.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, I need to do something about all this heart thumping.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is going to hear my heart pounding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you been waiting here the whole time?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, only for a little while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. What do you need from me?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I wanted to thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I do something you should thank me for?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You took care of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is that all? You don't have to go out of your way⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel weird being told that so seriously. Anyone would care for someone fainting in front of them.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Maybe if everyone were like you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I just wanted to thank you. I'll be going now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's going home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are you doing?! Stop her!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Kanna! Wait up for a second.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes? What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already dark. I'll walk with you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It only got so late because you were waiting for me, right? I should at least make up for that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But I don't mean to take your time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it. That way is toward downtown, right? I'm going the same way.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's rumors about that silly curse, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Plus, there's something I want to ask her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She'd be disappointed if she knew I had an ulterior motive.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]If that's what you really want to do, then I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Then please, allow me![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Of course. I'll walk with you until we get to my place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her guard is tighter than I thought.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should try talking to her a little on the way home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something about her has me curious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why does she make me feel that way though?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're downtown now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](As usual, it's a city that never sleeps. I actually like this place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's already night. The sun went down fast while we were walking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I haven't said a word to Kanna the whole time. I'm surprised I didn't suffocate myself trying to stay so quiet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is a lot worse than her having her guard up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know if she has any experience with guys at all.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that was just⋯the sound of a heartbeat. What is it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Where do you live?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house? What makes you ask about that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Because you said you were going in the same direction as I to go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, right. I did say that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We passed my house a while ago though.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]If we went past your house already, you can see me off here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She can see right through me.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'll be going then.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, my house is right over there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pardon me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You see that bright, neon sign?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The red one. It says 「EVENING」 on it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my house. How about coming up for a cup of tea or something?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't hesitate, it is my place after all. Oh yeah. What kind of drinks do you like?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I enjoy barley tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Barley tea, huh? (She went for a mature selection.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is that weird?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-Not at all. Okay, barley tea it is. Let's go then![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Excuse me. Hey, aren't you Koudai's son, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That girl is in uniform. She must be one of our students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's my classmate. I'm taking her home right now.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]You're not taking advantage of her on the way, are you?[%p]
*push*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, it's that woman.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hello, my boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not your boy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oops, sorry. I'm just so honest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That doesn't excuse anything.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, don't make that face. I know! How about we go karaoke?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There's a lot I want to ask you about.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*cough* Asakura?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oopsie. I still have some work I need to do.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, exactly.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your name was Takuya, right? Dr. Arima's son?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I want to see you again if I can. I'd love to talk to you about some things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Having tea with a girl at Evening? I didn't know you were so youthful, Headmaster.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's a work related meeting. Now, if you'll excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Work related, huh? I wonder what kind of work it is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, this woman⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Excuse me. I was in a rush.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no doubt in my mind. That's the woman I saw in the main hall at school.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seemed to be hurrying after Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, sorry about that. We were just about to go get some tea, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Who was that person?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They smelled different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They smelled different?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Shall we go? To your house, I mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Didn't you say your house was the place with the neon sign outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, right. That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lucky us. It's pretty empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The atmosphere is cool, and it's nice and quiet. Good little hole in the wall. It's a little bit pricey though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, there are some seats open. Why don't we take a seat?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Your house is really big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You have a big family, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's not serious, is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If she's joking, I'd rather she not have such a serious expression.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyways, let's go to the back. We can sit over there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said you like barley tea, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, can we have one barley tea and one iced tea please?[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Aye aye, sir![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is she your sister?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What was it you wanted to talk to me about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, did I say I wanted to talk about something? I just wanted to get some tea.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I just thought there might be something you wanted to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell if she's sharp or dull.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That earthquake or whatever has me curious though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still see some students around though. Staying for club activities, maybe?[%p]
