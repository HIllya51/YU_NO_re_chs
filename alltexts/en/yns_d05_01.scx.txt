[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate. I don't see Mitsuki or Yuuki anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they still looking for Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of the school. I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said I could see the mansion from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are the club activities over already?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really want to fix this misunderstanding as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to meet up with Mio to fix this misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Mio went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I saw her go into the school before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate. I think Mitsuki said she was on night shift.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I should head downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's been waiting for me for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope the entrance is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, it's pretty quiet. There aren't many people around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because remedial classes are over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still see some students around though. Staying for club activities, maybe?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been a while since that lightning incident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did that briefing or whatever end yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do, climb up there and pretend to be a cicada?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll say this: I don't like the plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. It holds those electric cables in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I explaining things like a dictionary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see it from here, but I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top one says 「Stop」 and the bottom one says 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's any space in the streets of Japan, these signs spring up like bamboo shoots.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's also true that looking at green makes you feel calm and relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these plants are here almost apologetically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they're not hurting anything so whatever, but I just don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's pretty bad to destroy nature only to turn around and say 「we love nature.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guardrail is tough enough to take a hit from a car.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course our tax dollars paid for it, so if anyone were to break it, they'd have to pay to fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I also pay consumer taxes, so that makes this partly mine⋯maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember Yuuki telling me a bunch of stuff yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said that was the origin of the curse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That must be the samurai mansion Ryuuzouji told me I could see from the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I always thought it was quite an extravagant mansion. So that's Ryuuzouji's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of person lives here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A traditional Japanese house with lots of nature around it. What a place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sparrows in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sparrows like to rest up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're stretched all around like spider webs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hot during the day, cold at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This asphalt is just like sand in the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really hot. I bet heat waves will come off it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The temperature of asphalt rises above 120 degrees at the peak of summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I'll be seeing mirages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school isn't very tall, but it's on a large property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd take a while to walk all the way around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this type of construction is called an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior design is actually pretty nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Sakaimachi Academy, the school I attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A safe name for a university, I guess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring up at the sky like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not many people around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, so I should have assumed that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that place matters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. Mitsuki must be going to Ryuuzouji's place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she'd leave soon, so I better hurry over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Time to run to Ryuuzouji's mansion![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go check out Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Ryuuzouji said he'd show me anyways.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not only Mio, but that old bastard of mine even went to see that tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll try going back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quicker to get to downtown from my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I came all this way only to go back to my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll try going back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Could Mio be there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyways, I'll start by going to the coastline to get there. All right, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio might be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Mio went that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I can go to Triangle Mountain from the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Mitsuki searching inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I think Mio went inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki said something about night watch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might be inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came out of there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyways, I'm sure Mio is waiting for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the front door open?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I can get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try going inside.[%p]
