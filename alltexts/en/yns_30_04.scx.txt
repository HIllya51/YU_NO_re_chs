[name]Takuya[line](This is just what they call force majeure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I always say shit like this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh⋯ D-Don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess we shouldn't say things we don't intend.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You haven't changed, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Please⋯ I'm lonely, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, me too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But⋯ You said it last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Said what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You said that⋯you can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Past words are made to be revoked.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Dummy.[%p]
Mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, you don't have to.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I've been really lonely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Liar⋯ You were so happy with Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the only one for me, Mitsuki⋯ I think.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What was that at the end? Mm.[%p]
I covered Mitsuki's lips with my own. Men and women in love don't need words.[%p]
Her lips were soft and had a bittersweet scent. I guess you'd call it the scent of a grown woman.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah⋯[%p]
We were both so excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no⋯ I'm getting dizzy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki. I love you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Me too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm yours, Takuya⋯only yours. Only yours.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Aah⋯ Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaah⋯ Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Say my name⋯ Say my name like you used to![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
Mitsuki's endless kisses gave me a pleasure beyond words.[%p]
I gave myself over to the comforting sense of exhaustion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Was it good?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it was.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mmm⋯ Good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're funny.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heheheh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you smiling about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]At times like these we don't talk much⋯ Neither of us do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess so.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because we're elated and our brains are tired?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Dummy⋯ Say something more romantic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want to hear?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Like⋯ Like two people in love don't need words.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pfft![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're more romantic than you look, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well excuse me. I'm actually a romantic type of girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that so?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's⋯gone.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We kissed even though we're in Mr. Ryuuzouji's garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, does that excite you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't ask me that kind of question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you just ask me, 「was it good?」[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It should be okay for me to ask too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was excited. Happy now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I am.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you know something?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never would have thought⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This mansion.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking from outside, there are so many trees.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're right. They say it's an old samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But when you look at it from outside, it's really spooky.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like you'd definitely see ghosts at night. Plus, there's a bunch of rumors about the curse.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know what you're trying to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just saying I was surprised when I actually stepped foot on the grounds.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look around you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't it feel like we're in a different world?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A different world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Laying on the grass like this with the sunlight coming through the leaves, hearing the birds singing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And a beautiful woman beside me as a bonus. There's nothing more I could ask for.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha! You idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think my image of this place is gonna totally change.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's an old saying by a poet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, let me hear it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]With my true love by my side, the roughest landscape becomes covered in flowers, darkness turns to light, night to day, and rainy clouds turn into a blue sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're slow. Everything looks nice because I'm beside you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pfft![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey! Are you laughing?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I'm not making fun of you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Fine⋯ It's been a long time since we could relax together like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Has it been so long?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you remember what you said to me with that light in your eyes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I forgot.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I will make you happy, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaah! Don't bring up the ancient past like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was just over a month ago. Did you already forget?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I didn't forget. But you pushed me away. You said I was emotionally unstable.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, but now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you serious?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you thinking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So, you've already made up your mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, um, that's not what I mean. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I should have taken you with me then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You would have regretted it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wouldn't mind if it were you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd be the kind of guy that gets blind drunk everyday and flips over the coffee table.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And I'd make plastic plants on the side at night for extra money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I'd go to the horse track every day, play mahjong all the time, and go to the arcade.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'd be in the background watching you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pfft![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just joking⋯ Forget I said that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm a teacher, and you're a student, so we can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, we can't. Besides, I hate guys who have an Oedipus complex.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Where did you get that idea?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You once called out Ayumi's name in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She is really cute. I don't blame you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmph. I'm younger though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're only two years apart.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?![%p]
*bite*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow ow ow! You don't have to bite me![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's Ryuuzouji like?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The professor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's he like? He was my best professor in college.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the same as Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]When she met Ari–I mean, your father, she would study with me occasionally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you acquaintances?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Not really. We were just in the same lecture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. What was my old man like?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It seemed like he was very close with Professor Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you don't really know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to apologize.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]However⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The professor⋯he changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Changed how?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He'd look at me with these eyes that sent shivers down my spine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's no reason really, I just got that feeling. And that note⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The one you found in the well, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, but it was in the professor's lab first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Laboratory?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The professor was looking through the lab for the diary. He asked me if I had seen it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the lab?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So did he find it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He stopped looking for it as soon as I got there. When I asked him if I could help, he refused.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But then⋯why was that one piece of paper found in the well?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, so Ryuuzouji was looking for his diary in the lab. That's strange.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He still looks for it when he goes to the lab sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The diary?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, that's kinda weird.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of weird, what about the storehouse?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If you came here, then you already saw it, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, he told me last night. He said everything got out of hand.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]When do you think that storehouse is from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like when was it built?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, something like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the mansion itself was built around 400 years ago, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You sure know your stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you know. So that means it's at least several hundred years old.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Bzzz! Wrong answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was built six months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I didn't even notice it was like that until about a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A month ago? That's pretty weird.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was built six months ago, and it was all messed up a month ago. That means it was destroyed in just five months.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's what the math says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how bad the construction work was, wouldn't five months be a little quick?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But that's how it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must have been built like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No⋯ It looked much better six months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So someone intentionally messed it up a month ago?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why would someone do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no clue.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Isn't it strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, it is strange.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To tell you the truth, I talked to Ryuuzouji a bit last night.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The professor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. We talked about my old man, research⋯ We just went on and on.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is that so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji seemed scared in the diary, but last night, he was completely put together.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did that one page of his diary say?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think I remember. Um⋯[%p]
「⋯terrifying. What kind of person is she⋯ask for my help?」[%p]
「⋯to me, that is something of Koudai's. I'm sure of it.」[%p]
「If she has, then⋯terrifying⋯」[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It must have been right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, leave it to a history teacher to have such a good memory.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't make fun of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who 「she」 is?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He wrote, 「I don't know what kind of person she is,」 so Ryuuzouji doesn't seem to know either.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Possibly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of person 「she」 could be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're so quiet all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing. I just thought of something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know the show News Presence?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I heard its viewership is really good. She's only on a few times a week, but that's the show with the cute woman as a news anchor, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen her meet with Ryuuzouji before.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So could it have been that woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure. That's all I can think of for now though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, I'd like to meet with that Kaori woman again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder where I'd be able to meet her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, that's quite the problem.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*yawn* I'm starting to get sleepy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, you can't sleep yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm all warm, and you're so soft.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Care to elaborate?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, at this rate⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Never mind. It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
