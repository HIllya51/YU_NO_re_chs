[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I know I heard a scream. It came from this park![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The woman who screamed should still be here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯ Where are you?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Aah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A voice. I heard a woman's voice.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Please, stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She came running from over there⋯ Oh, two guys are after her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's surrounded![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some gangster guys are attacking her![%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Don't be so cold, baby.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stay away from me![%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Come on, don't be like that. Let's get to know each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, Ayumi⋯ I'll be there soon. Wait, what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen those two before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it was at the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That skinny guy and fat dude.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Now, give that to me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]G-Give you what?[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Don't play stupid. The envelope in your hands.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]B-But this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go rescue Ayumi![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, we seem to run into each other often. It must be fate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get out of my way. I don't have time to chat with you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I said, it's okay. I think Chief Arima will be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How would you know that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Because that's what's written in the plot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck is this woman even saying?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But if you go out there, things will turn out differently. Unexpected scenarios will be deleted by force.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Meaning Chief Arima might be okay, but you might not be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ahh! Stop![%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Give it up![%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Would you hurry it up? You little⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?! Dammit, I can't take this anymore.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Stop, don't be stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't be serious! I can't just let them do that![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It wouldn't be a smart thing to do⋯neither for you nor for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It means exactly what I said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't have time to listen to excuses. Just get out of my way.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, wait a second.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sheesh, can't say I didn't warn you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you guys![%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Who the hell are you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Was he in the script?[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Nope⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]He must be an improv or something.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Must be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I called the police already. They'll be here in five minutes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Bluffing counts as a tactic, right?)[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]What, you two know each other or something?[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Don't let a young man like this get to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you hear me? The police are coming![%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Haha! Hey, you hear that?[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]He's bluffing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll see if I'm bluffing if you wait around long enough.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Hmph, talking big, eh?[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]According to this kid, we've got five more minutes to spare.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Right. A whole five minutes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did I mess this up?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should have said they'd be here in one minute.)[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Five minutes is enough time to beat him half to death.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Should we get down to it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]S-Stop! Please, I'm begging you![%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]We're just gonna break his arms.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Yeah, maybe give him a few bruises while we're at it. No big deal.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I-I'll give you the envelope! Just stop, please![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, you don't have to give them anything. That's important to you, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here, you can have it. Just please, stop this. Take this and leave![%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Well, as long as we got what we came for.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]That's damn right.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]We'll be takin' that.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Deal's a deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, you don't have to give them anything![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, just be quiet![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯ Why?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]All right, looks like this is it.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Yup, looks like it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please leave. I'm begging you.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Heh, heh⋯ Hey lady.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Yeah, lady.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]We're way better than that little man over there.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Judging by the look on your face, you probably haven't had a man in a while.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]If you get tired of sleepin' alone, just come to me.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]You're probably out here trying to pick up guys anyway, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These bastards⋯ They think they can say whatever they want!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't listen to this anymore!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Uh oh. This isn't working at all.)[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]This guy's a moron⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Ya left us no choice.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]No choice.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]S-Stop! Please, I'm begging you![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'm not letting anyone get away with hurting Chief Arima![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that who I think it is⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That asshole⋯ What the hell is he doing here⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My vision is suddenly so white⋯now it's black⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm getting an odd sensation of floating⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck is going on⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel something cold on my cheek⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](For one second, it felt like someone was branding me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But now it's cold⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The ground is right next to me⋯ Is something wrong with Earth's gravity?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gosh, these pesky little pebbles digging into my cheek really hurt⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Somehow⋯it feels good though⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Takuya⋯ Takuya!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hear Ayumi. She sounds so far away⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's she panicking about⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not morning yet, Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She probably set her alarm to the wrong hour again and came to wake me up in the middle of the night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hahaha⋯ Ayumi is like that sometimes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Takuya⋯ Are you okay? Takuya!))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Chief, it's okay. I will take him⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whose voice is that⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just the sound of that voice pisses me off⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm fine⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a little tired⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ I'm sleepy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just want⋯to sleep for a little while⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a little while⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]From here, it looks like there's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees grow thick⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a bench, man. No one's sitting here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An unoccupied bench.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's inside the garbage can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me check things that should be obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In here? Yeah right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one here. Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entire park's only light source.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only other light comes from the moon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lamp. It's dim, but it's turned on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This park has so much greenery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could that voice be coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is an apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way a scream could have come from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A big apartment building is next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That has nothing to do with this right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A private residence next to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the residence next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where the heck did I hear that scream come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fountain at the center of the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They wouldn't be in the water, would they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, is this really a time for jokes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the sound of radio waves. A scream like that wouldn't come from the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, they have to be somewhere. The woman who screamed has to be somewhere around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if she's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are usually a bunch of couples necking behind the bushes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But of course, no one's around tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is the person that screamed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't use that item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you have something better to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! I can't use that there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just give it some more thought.[%p]
