[name]Takuya[line]Who was that on the phone just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is my living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm home from school. What now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living room's quiet⋯ Well, sort of.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is ringing now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only living space Ayumi and I really share.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess the bathroom isn't so much shared as it is common use.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I think it would be nicer if it was shared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living room is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my room and my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door on the left is my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess you could say the matter is settled. We have to start clearing it out soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door on the right is my room. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish I could answer the phone through that TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I just hurry up and answer it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's your typical wide-screen TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not really anything I want to watch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the local broadcasts fit the current dimensions. I don't need to stretch the picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not high definition, and the receiver isn't top of the line or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It just forces the normal picture into wider dimensions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems kind of pointless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, come to think of it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This TV has been left on a lot lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I almost never watch it, so it must be Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's usually watching news programs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder which one she prefers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A needlessly large TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it serves its purpose anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not feeling so good. It's probably from staring at that weird image.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to lie down in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there's a note here from Ayumi. What's it say?[%p]
「I'm working late today. Here's some cash to order delivery. - Ayumi」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's fifty dollars here. That's not very much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's barely enough for a beef bowl, let alone a four-course meal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay. It's probably enough for ten beef bowls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! Who am I kidding? I couldn't handle more than five![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bleh. Just thinking about five beef bowls is giving me heartburn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I don't need dinner after all. I'll just keep the fifty bucks for myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The receiver on the counter is ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and answer that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The cordless is on there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a phone in my room and one in Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, there are three phones altogether.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could be calling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The counter isn't really a great place to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I usually eat at the counter there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to eat now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I wanted to answer the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll pick up the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just answer the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to push the answer button on the cordless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just 「Press」 the button now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell am I talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just, click and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello, this is Arima.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I go to the trouble to pick up the phone, and they can't be bothered to answer? How rude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been getting a lot of silent calls lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somebody's been calling here a lot lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's a girl who likes me? Yeah, that's it. She calls to talk to me, but when she hears me answer, she loses her nerve and hangs up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would be nice. It's probably not true though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are probably plenty of idiots who just call random numbers hoping a woman will answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been the one answering the phone lately, but that hasn't seemed to bother them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which I guess means they don't care whether it's a man or woman who answers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get how people can have so much free time on their hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I was going to order delivery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm craving a beef bowl, no beef. Delivery it is![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course the phone rings right when I'm about to order.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. If I don't answer the phone, I can't order delivery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I want to order delivery, I have to answer the phone first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'm not gonna eat or watch TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staying here won't accomplish anything. I'll go up to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not in such a rush to get outside that I should ignore that phone call.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and answer the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not really a homebody. I just like being at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm tired. I don't want to go outside anymore.[%p]
