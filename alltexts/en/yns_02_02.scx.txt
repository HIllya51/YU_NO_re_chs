[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm looking for Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No use in lounging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No time to be lazing around like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm looking for Mitsuki. Why am I loafing around in the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I hope Ayumi doesn't catch a cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to my room soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go outside so⋯what should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi was talking about video recording. I wonder what she was doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, what to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, what to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi said she was doing an inspection. What am I doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you home?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. She hasn't come home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, I should go to school and look for Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a direct light, but the slight dimness is the one drawback.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light. Indirect lighting has become popular recently, but I'm more practical than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not one indirect light in the house. Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I boast about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtains. I don't think now is the time to be worrying about the curtains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The color of these curtains is beautiful. This must be Ayumi's choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi waters these every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's just a keepsake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard can be so traditional about the strangest things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would a non-normal video tape look like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some kind of video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not an 「adults only」 one though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A family picture⋯ Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A family picture⋯ That old bastard is photobombing a picture with Ayumi and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get annoyed just looking at it. I should ignore it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A needlessly large TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No reason to watch the TV now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough with the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to see Ayumi upset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Video recording? Nothing seems to be recorded on this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was on the TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, this is perfect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time for the popular news program, News Presence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯ I feel like I've seen this woman somewhere before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that chatty lady I met in front of my house and Geo Technics![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No doubt about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, so she's a newscaster. Now I get it⋯[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((⋯so News Presence has invited the head facilitator of Geo Technics back to the studio.))[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((We're here with Head Facilitator Arima.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((⋯so News Presence has invited the head facilitator of Geo Technics back to the studio.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((We're here with Head Facilitator Arima.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Head Facilitator Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman on the left is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's turn up the volume.[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((So, Ms. Arima, you claim the company is blameless?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes. Normally, no one would ever expect lightning to strike coastal construction work, so there was no way to prepare for it at all.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is talking on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pressing her for information about the construction accident.[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((Yet lightning struck again today. And it may strike again in the future.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Well, that is⋯))[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((Are you aware the public is demanding the company take responsibility?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((You are on this show to tell us exactly what caused this, not to make excuses.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((So, Ms. Arima, you claim the company is blameless?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes. Normally, no one would ever expect lightning to strike coastal construction work, so there was no way to prepare for it at all.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is talking on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pressing her for information about the construction accident.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Yet lightning struck again today. And it may strike again in the future.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Well, that is⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Are you aware the public is demanding the company take responsibility?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((You are on this show to tell us exactly what caused this, not to make excuses.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pretty much bullying her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in a real bind. Damn, that reporter is a bitch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure she's just another gossip hyena that calls herself a journalist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She uses mass media to invade people's privacy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow Ayumi, don't yell like that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't look too great on camera, do I? I think the left side is my prettier side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Aww, if only I had better clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what you meant about the video recording?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is bad. It's like a fish on a cutting board, they'll do whatever they want with you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, well the news anchor is telling the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The accident is the company's fault. We have a duty to take the blame for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But on TV⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Would you say the accident is a result of the company's negligence?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((No, I'm not saying that. It wasn't a mistake on management's part. We're viewing this as just an accident.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What a nasty woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, tell me about it. She's so slimy–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, I'm talking about myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's so obvious that I'm just making excuses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯not true.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have to follow the policies of the company. That's my job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the things you said on TV aren't what you really think?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't say that. Not in my position.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It can't be helped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But people might hate you for this.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's the burden of responsibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well I won't have it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks. I wanted you to see a much more wonderful me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯as I've said, the company is absolutely not at fault and⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, it sounds like I'm just trying to escape the blame.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's enough. I don't want to see anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, to be honest I had never wanted a drink more than after that interview. But I had to go back to the office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So even you need a drink sometimes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Of course I do. That's not fair of you to say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I meant⋯ Sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is everything at work okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*laugh* Thank you. But everything is fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you need anything, I'm here. I might be able to help.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's fine, really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is just hypothetical, but⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If my old man⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that old bastard, you know, if he⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If he what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If he were alive, what would you do?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't answer that. I don't want to get excited over something purely hypothetical.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Right⋯ Sorry. I shouldn't have asked.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hypothetical⋯ It might be just that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not even I can believe that bastard is alive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, what should we do? I can cook some dinner if you want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nah, I kind of lost my appetite.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Because of me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Of course not. My stomach is just fussy, that's all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll probably be hungry in a half hour or so.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll cook for you then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll run a bath for you, and you can hop in when it's ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Now, the kitchen. Coming home to chores is so much work.[%p]
*pit, pat, pit, pat*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was I trying to say to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm such an idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A needlessly large TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No reason to watch the TV now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A useless TV that plays nothing but local channels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep seeing news about Geo Technics being criticized on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure there's no end to Ayumi's anxiety.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It smells like Ayumi a little bit. *sniff* Hahhh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a soft couch. I'm sleepy just sitting on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I shouldn't sit down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These cushions are so nice and soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi always sits on these⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And once she leaves, I bury my face in them. I love it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That just makes me a weirdo though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to sit down now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair I can use to sit at the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At Ayumi's height, her toes can barely touch the ground sitting on this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's always swinging her feet in the air like a little kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't cook, so this is no use to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can do is spin it atop a chopstick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plates and bowls for food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi puts the food she cooks on these.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not very thirsty, so I'll just leave it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd love to be drinking with Ayumi, just the two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she only sees me as her stepson.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge looks empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anything is inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh my god![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll buy juice next time I'm out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I'm on my period, so no need to have a staring contest with the calendar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still so hot this season. I hope it cools down soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Although I'll probably be hoping it warms up once it starts getting really cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light. No need to turn it on now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fluorescent lights aren't good for places where you eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes your food look unappetizing. Yellow lighting is better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know art too well, so I should leave this alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is some kind of ethnic thing my old man brought home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be some kind of art piece. I don't know anything about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living room light isn't exactly dim, so I guess this is just for design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi likes green. She doesn't like sticky green stuff though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Neither do I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi likes this kind of stuff. She really likes green, I know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember one time when I handed her some green slime. She let out a nice scream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a pretty steep staircase. Going up to the second floor is tiring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I said that, Ayumi told me I sounded like an old man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a spiral staircase.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One time, I tumbled down these steps like a soccer ball.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rolled right into the china cabinet, and all the dishes crashed down on top of me. The broken pieces really cut me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi was laughing pretty hard until she saw how badly I was hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't slide around though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hardwood floor. It's nice and cool on my bare feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be too cold to stand on in the winter though. What a selfish floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to order delivery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at the phone makes me want to order food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cordless handset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We get lots of prank phone calls lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who would do such a thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no use for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The counter is for eating and drinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi loves shopping for plates and pans and stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's quite a bit piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One time, I tumbled down these steps like a soccer ball. I rolled right into the china cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the dishes crashed down on top of me, and the broken pieces really cut me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the stairs and the china cabinet remind me of that day⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the use of standing in the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have other things to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the living room won't do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Let's go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no reason for me to leave the house now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's late. I should go to my room.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess not.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, nice and quiet⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What did I say?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't get anything past me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can see you! You're not allowed to go out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside and⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're not allowed out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Why not?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You've been going out a lot recently. Couldn't you at least spend evenings with me, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Spending evenings with her does sound nice.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Okay, I got it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm hm hmmm⋯hm hm hmmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is humming to herself while she cleans the kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I should just give up trying to go out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. I doubt I'll be able to slip past Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this time–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Nothing. I was just making sure you were here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She knows me too well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, tip toe⋯tip toe⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey Takuya, what do you want for dinner?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! Uh, I-Indian food maybe?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay, curry it is then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if she did that on purpose or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go outside?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya! Are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! I'm here![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay. It'll just be a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's really sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's late. I should go to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. No point in spacing out right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to my room.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So you're going back to your room? I'll call you when the bath is ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But doesn't it make you curious?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Ayumi said something about a video recording.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to my room, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the study?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt anything is there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing for me to do in the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only thing I can do right now is go back to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was told to wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing for me to do in the study. I'm pretty hungry, so I should wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man's study. For some reason, nothing is left in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's study. I guess I could go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, did you forget Mitsuki's phone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I have time for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really have anything to do here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure Ayumi is changing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's a no-go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing for me to do in Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times you choose it, things won't change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's my stepmother. I shouldn't think about stupid stuff like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no good at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe if it were a coincidence, but to do it on purpose⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I put it down to just a coincidence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No no no, it wouldn't be right to do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, she's changing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯ What am I thinking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Ayumi left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no real reason for me to go there.[%p]
