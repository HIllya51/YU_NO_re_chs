[name]Takuya[line]The coastline is under construction.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]*sigh* You never know when an accident might happen again.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]I applied for the job because of the good pay, but man was that a mistake.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Hey, this is just between you and me, okay?[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]They call these insulated uniforms but they're just construction clothes coated with vinyl.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Can this really protect us against lightning?[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]There was another lightning accident the day before yesterday. One guy died.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]I don't care how good the pay is. My life is more important.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]By the way, Toyotomi will get mad if he catches you here or around Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Huh, who?[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]That's the scary construction director. He only has one volume: yelling as loud as he can.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Oh, but I'm pretty sure he isn't here today.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Maybe we can slack off a little. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Things are so much more pleasant without Toyotomi around.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]That's a secret though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't seem like it when I looked at it from the rooftop, but this is a pretty large-scale construction job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought they were doing some geological survey for the company's building expansions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Building expansions, huh? Does Ayumi's company make that much money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they do, I wish they'd increase her bonus⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this is a large-scale construction project.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That lone mountain I can see in front of me is a famous spot in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only a few hundred feet high. It's a bit of a stretch to call it a mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone in this town calls it 「Triangle Mountain.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Triangle Mountain」 is just its nickname. Its real name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It got its name from the shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really does look like a sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of theories and legends about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The locals around here say the recent lightning accidents were caused by the wrath of the guardian deity that protects Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A warning against the destruction of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of plausible things about that rocky peak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That building up on the hill is Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be more precise, it's a building owned by Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a research company that studies the land and minerals. I don't know the specifics though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics is the one doing all that construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they're really going to expand the building that far⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the company that Ayumi works for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I heard something about the construction director not being around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go check it out. Just for a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're not going to completely destroy such a famous spot, are they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, it looks like it's a restricted area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can go to the Sakaimachi Academy using that road on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came here from the academy, so I don't need to go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house is in the opposite direction of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd rather go to the base of Triangle Mountain than back to my house though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if I can get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if I can get to Triangle Mountain somehow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things might get messy if the construction workers find me. Hmmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like swimming in the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First of all, there's construction going on. Second, I don't have swimming trunks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I can't swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean I can't swim, per se, just that I won't swim right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I can't swim here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I explaining myself to anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not allowed to swim here.[%p]
