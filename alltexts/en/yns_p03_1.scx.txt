[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where the key is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key to the study can wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to stay focused on getting there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like the key to the study is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Oh, the phone. Don't scare me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello, this is Arima.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Takuya?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yes⋯ Oh, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes. Listen to me.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you sound so upset?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((A package arrived for you today–))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She hung up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on with Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said something arrived for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's 9:50 now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so convenient that phones show the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, what was that call from Ayumi about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She says it's work, but it's almost ten o'clock. Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost ten o'clock?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's letter said to go to the Sword Cape at ten o'clock⋯ Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's supposed to be waiting there. It might be the old bastard himself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't stay here doing nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I were to search somewhere else⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the flower vase? No reason to hide it there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Behind the picture frame? Why would he hide it there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Under the cushion⋯ Nope, I don't see anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯maybe it's not in this room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or⋯ Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Panties that are mostly made of string. It'd be nice to find something like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would Ayumi need to hide the key with her underwear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it, closets aren't really the place to put a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Closets themselves are basically hiding places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to hide the key to the study. Which means the key isn't going to be in the closet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then where is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where else can I look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hate to do it, but first I have to check the closet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, a s-s-see through negligee.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course there's nothing like that. Ayumi wears pajamas.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me explain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I'll look a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about inside the drawer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's mostly accessories. All small stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are cute broaches and earrings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wouldn't put the key to the study in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should close it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought it would be in Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells good⋯ It's Ayumi's scent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop. I'm here looking for something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the key isn't in the vanity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel bad rifling through a woman's vanity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this is an emergency. Sorry, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, Ayumi has some really dark lipstick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder when she puts this on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should keep searching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eyeshadow⋯ Does Ayumi really use things like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi always looks like she wears almost no make-up at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I'm here for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Necklaces⋯ Rings⋯ Hair clips⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now this really looks like a woman's vanity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It looks like it's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a little girl's vanity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「You're too old for this.」 Nah, that's not something I can say to her face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She dresses pretty young.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to think about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to look harder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I get close to the bed, I get kind of sleepy all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key won't be on the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi's bed smells so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-When I take a sniff at it, it makes me feel good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*flop, snuggle snuggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cute⋯but it's not what I'm looking for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi still loves her rabbits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's inside the rabbit? There's no way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a detective story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if I don't leave soon I'll be late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, I'm in the room anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look for the key to the study.[%p]
