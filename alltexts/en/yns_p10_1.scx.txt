[name]Takuya[line]This is the school rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There doesn't seem to be anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can smell the ocean. You can see the ocean over by the handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because summer vacation starts tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like everyone went home already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I can see the ocean over the handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's still under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, that big pointy rock in front of me is Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can see it if you go to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I look at it one more time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it'll change if I look again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yep, still the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it'll be the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it'll just be the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I got called to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't hurry, I'll lose points again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, why did I come the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Ayumi is inside the school. Should I look for her?[%p]
