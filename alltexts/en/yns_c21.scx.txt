[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When people eat out, they usually go somewhere around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there are so many restaurants and coffee shops around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they go inside one of these places, it will be really difficult to find them.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Isn't that Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see her a lot around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was walking toward the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hotel and a beautiful woman⋯ That's not a bad combination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hotel has an observation room and a restaurant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a great spot for dates.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is going out with who?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Yuuki is looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A place Mio would go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not downtown. I looked all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not in the downtown area?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's getting into evening, so there are more people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That coffee shop will also open soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't imagine she would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to ask as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I walking around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get this painkiller to Ayumi as soon as possible.[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems she was following Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The downtown area is full of various shops and tons of neon signs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess I should buy it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The drugstore is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The downtown area is full of various shops and tons of neon signs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The downtown area is full of various shops and tons of neon signs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is the perfect example of a city that never sleeps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are neon signs lit up over all kinds of shops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a bad place to just walk around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no good. It's practically impossible to find Toyotomi downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unless something happens.[%p]
