[name]Ayumi[line]There's still some time left before the afternoon briefing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So I decided to do some cleaning, see?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is⋯smiling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's grinning for some reason.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has a great smile, but how can she be happy after what happened⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry⋯ I guess I was mistaken.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you really okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Maybe I just studied too much. Haha⋯ha.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, the phone. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was I⋯wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not a misunderstanding. This is probably⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to my room. I have some thinking to do.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Seriously, what's wrong? Was there another problem at school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know I went to the shrine. Ayumi and Ryuuzouji were there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It couldn't have been a dream.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means the only possibility is that Ayumi's lying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But, why would she need to lie?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if Ayumi isn't lying⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that's the case, then what about the Ayumi I saw at the shrine?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, what's wrong? You're acting a little weird today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? Your face is turning pale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did something happen with Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, well⋯ Don't you remember what happened last night, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry, I thought I already apologized.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apologized?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This is about working overtime, right? You had to order take out again–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Overtime?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek! Wh-What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry⋯ What do you mean you were working overtime?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well⋯ I was busy at work and had to spend the night at the office⋯ All-nighters aren't so good for my skin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second. So what about the shrine?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The one at the base of Triangle Mountain? What about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm down⋯ Just calm down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If this isn't some kind of joke, then Ayumi really doesn't remember⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then, what happened last night at the shrine⋯ Was that a dream?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say, Ayumi, do you remember anything happening recently?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, does she seriously⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, what's this all about?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, right, the study. I cleared out the stuff here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cleared it out?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. There were too many research materials lying about. I gave them to Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I just finished cleaning up. It looks so big and spacious now, doesn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah, it does⋯but that's not what I was asking about.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was asking about Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You should really call him Headmaster Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. At the shrine, he⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]More than just 「something.」[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't understand what you're talking about⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this some kind of joke?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's cute with her hair down, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always wears her hair up, but it's down today.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's cute with her hair down, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always wears her hair up, but it's down today.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her neck is sexy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi makes even the most boring accessories look refined.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A pretty view⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I really be looking at her chest now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such a casual outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's wearing comfortable clothes for a change.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi looks good in a suit, but this is nice, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not her hands⋯ Let's talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They look so soft and smooth⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi. I should try to talk to her now.)[%p]
