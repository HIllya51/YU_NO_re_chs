[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. Just don't stray too far from me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could this be⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like some kind of trail marker.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we follow it, where will it take us?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's beautiful. Everything is lined up so nice and neat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lined up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, it does look like all the statues are in the same direction.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Di-rec-tion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. See, it's in order, all the way to the end.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Like a trail marker![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ It might lead all the way to the temple.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What are we going to do, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with all these broken statues?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's⋯kind of creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The heavy aura these statues are giving up is palpable.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]They're all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is all this?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]There are so many buried in this huge desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Let's take a more careful look at it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]There are so many.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, these statues are everywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could they be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I look at it carefully, I can see that they're almost like coffins.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet there's nothing but stone inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, there could be bodies⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What are we going to do, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, there's no apparent way to check if they're coffins.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if I checked, what would I do then?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're heavy, made of stone, and about the size of an adult.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They really look like coffins.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's a cof-fin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A box that dead people go in to be buried.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]So there are people inside these?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nonsense⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with all these broken stone statues? What the hell?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What the hell?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be a copycat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they made of⋯stone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're really hard.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Let me touch them![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, I told you not to leave my side.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay, well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]These are some awesome statues.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Statues⋯huh. There is some kind of design on the fronts of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A relief carving of a person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what it's for, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a figure of a person carved into it. This is a relief sculpture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what is it for?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I get a bad feeling just looking at them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I agree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they're giving a direction to go, let's follow them.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ My heart is beating really fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it? Want a massage?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ I mean it. My chest is getting hot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's been like this before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was when the earthquake happened.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When we got home, Celes was⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just what is she predicting?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hope it's not some kind of bad omen.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's gonna be okay. Just promise not to leave my side.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just keep going for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll do that after we look into this more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on a second. Doesn't this bother you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's keep looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said, we're not going anywhere yet. We need to examine this first.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nowhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, let's go back.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Go back where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where indeed.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Are you okay? You seem tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm having trouble moving this.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We can't even move it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure I can move this with my strength alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only as big as an adult, but it's got to weigh more than 200lbs.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mrrggg⋯ Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way you can move it, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to help anymore.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Don't say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Come on, Daaad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You're holding me in your arms![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aw⋯ I wanted you to hold me longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a strange thing to say to your dad.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I love you, Dad. Never let me go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aww⋯ I wanted you to hold me closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a strange thing to say to your dad.[%p]
