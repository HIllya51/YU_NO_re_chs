[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is a woman who says what she thinks without holding back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But something that was stuck in my heart feels looser now.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh dear, you look worried again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not like your stepmother will take all that responsibility, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ You might be right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You'll get exhausted if you only think about your crush.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. You put this all on me⋯but aren't you the one who's being negligent?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You may be right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Uh oh⋯ I think I said too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, that's what I like about you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just apologizing for being wrong⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There aren't many people who would do that. You should be proud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* I have to go soon. Ryuuzouji is waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hand?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know, noticing what a woman wants in this situation is how you get popular with the ladies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not trying to be popular⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Quit your grumbling. Come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah⋯ Your Highness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, there's a crack in your armor, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing all the sudden, geez.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did she see us?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Um⋯ I wanted to talk to you about before⋯ So I followed you and⋯ I was looking for you, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯ Th-This isn't what it looks like.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm sorry, I was being careless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it. It already happened.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hurry and go after her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh⋯ I said go after her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It looks like she went toward the school. Go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ I'll go after her![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be gentle. Got it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure⋯ I will.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* Now get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See ya![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*sigh* I feel like a relationship counselor.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Even though I need to get my own love life in order.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But lately, Ryuuzouji has been⋯[%p]
⋯
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah⋯ The worries of youth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That reminds me, I heard some gossip, or maybe a rumor that interested me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A rumor?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Looks like there will be an investigation into that company soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?! You mean the police?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Listen, it's just a rumor, but it looks like the mayor may be corrupt and well⋯ It's not looking good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And with the recent accidents on top of that⋯ It looks like these investigations will start all at once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the police will step in?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, I'm sure the company will just blame someone and say they've fulfilled their social and moral obligations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who will they blame?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know⋯ I'm sure they'll just find a scapegoat, like when a politician blames his secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Your stepmother works at that company, doesn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She does.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An investigation, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're gonna blame someone⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's hopeless love, huh? For the both of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For me, it's not really love. I just care for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's called love.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ I don't think that's it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll ask you a few questions and be the judge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really want some irresponsible appraisal.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on, they're serious questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ Or are you afraid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid. All right. Start whenever you want.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No opinions. Just answer yes or no. Got it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Your stepmother⋯ Mrs. Arima. Do you think about her a lot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ I guess so. But that's–[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No opinions. Next question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't let me finish⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Does your chest ache when you think of her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sometimes it aches. But that's–[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, no opinions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you feel like you want to do something for your stepmother?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I do. I mean, we're–[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't need your opinion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, last question. Do you like her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What? No answer means a yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That question's not fair.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right, so based on all those answers–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I object to all the questions.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're in love. And it's heated. Enough to burn your heart and your body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you're wrong. There's a world of difference between familial love and romantic love.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's wrong, too. Love between parent and child, lovers, married couples, brothers and sisters⋯ It's all love.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those are different types.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How are they different?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they're⋯ She's my stepmother and⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No no no no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The concept of her being your stepmother is getting in your way. Your logical patterns of thought are being blocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she is my stepmother.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're not blood-related.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she's still my stepmother.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's just on paper. So what if she changed her name from Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How would you feel about her then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not like I haven't thought about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it possible Ayumi could lose the name Arima?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, there's no reason for her to keep clinging on to our family.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But maybe I'm looking forward to that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Because then I could finally talk to Ayumi as an equal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's stupid⋯ She's my stepmother. What's wrong with that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Aaah shit! Why do I have to worry about this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez. Mitsuki's statements always get to me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Lately, Ryuuzouji been a little⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A little what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That man is a scholar and clearly different from normal people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That man, huh?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But lately, Ryuuzouji doesn't pay any attention to me at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's more than I needed to know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's not what I mean, dummy. He's sort of clerical, or should I say⋯mechanical. You know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't hold out any hope for being with him anymore. I just want to help him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's admirable.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't say it like that. I'm doing what I like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You don't call me at all anymore, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well you don't either, do you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was like some kind of fever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We were together so much just a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](One month ago⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Exactly when they told me the old bastard was dead.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was totally out of control then.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]To use a difficult term, that's an Oedipus complex.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know what that is. That's Freud, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, you're quite the scholar. Yes, it means a son loving his mother and hating his father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, unfortunately⋯ She's not my actual mother. We're not blood-related.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're an idiot. She's your mother in concept. Being blood-related doesn't matter in these cases.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Young people struggling with hopeless love. It's just so innocent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're talking like you're not in the same boat.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We're the same⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The same?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have feelings for Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, I see. Mitsuki likes Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those are full hips. You'll have lots of healthy babies.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I bet you say that to all the girls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her earring is gleaming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You wear earrings, right Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you don't really like dangly ones, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, I'm glad you remembered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a serene smile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's perfectly messy, but not sloppy in style.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A pretty bob cut.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a little mussed by the ocean breeze right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's some dangerous cleavage.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look so soft.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯the blue sky.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're not making any sense, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Bad boy. You shouldn't look there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* You really are straight-forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Pale and translucent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such beautiful skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such beautiful skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki isn't that cheap.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Enough now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe. I really like how straight-forward you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to take that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such delicate hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's covering her knees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be a love bite there she doesn't want me to see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, of course there isn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's gotta be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those bare legs are mesmerizing⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those are the legs of a real woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see the ocean in the distance.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're doing construction there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although, it seems the construction is on hold now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they're still doing construction on the shore.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is a pretty rough time for that company now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rough?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know about those construction accidents, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In any case, I'd say that's a really nice skirt.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're the only one who would say it that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You must be really confident in your legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If not, you wouldn't show them off so much.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, you say it like I want people to look at them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No I don't. It's just a simple matter of fashion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Really?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a skirt. And it's dangerously short.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That may be true, but you shouldn't stare so blatantly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish I had x-ray vision.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just her underwear beneath that blouse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just thinking about it makes me dizzy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This actually is a place we could stretch out.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So? It's a nice place, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Good job finding it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't think many people come here, and you can relax.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is smiling, but I think she might be pretty tired.)[%p]
