[name]Takuya[line]It's still all damp around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long have we been walking?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That sturdy door is up ahead⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yup⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is all wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where the water is flowing from⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't have a single clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the dampness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see some jagged, bare rocks.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It feels nice and cool on your hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'm going to keep moving ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'm going to head back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
