[name]Takuya[line]This should be a mining site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because of the earthquake, everything is ruined. There's no one here anymore.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This isn't good. The buildings were completely destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's⋯gone.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Are you all right, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't you tell just by looking at me? I don't need a god as long as I'm alive.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't decided yet.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, decide soon. It's almost sunset. It's getting cold again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I should tell you, we don't have any food or water. Please remember that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would we need to worry about that?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Because our fate is in the hands of that flying Nogard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]And it only listens to you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯ She's already exhausted from carrying us.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]So you just want us to wait around here, doing nothing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about walking?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]To the Imperial Capital? It could take weeks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too far away from here⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It wouldn't be so bad if the Imperial Capital was closer. You have no idea where you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Would it really take weeks to reach the Imperial Capital?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Without food or water, that's impossible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We can be grateful to Kun-Kun for flying us as far as she could, but now she's exhausted.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If we stay⋯)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The Nogard's not as weak as it looks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If we flew, we could probably reach the Imperial Capital within a couple of days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A couple days⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Or do you want to experience the same fate as everyone else here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine⋯ Let's ask Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What a strange thing to say! Nogards aren't human. It's just a creature. A pet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she's smart.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Plants are smart, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's my daughter's friend. And mine.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Heh⋯ Whatever you say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where would they have taken her?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Your daughter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This isn't funny. It's life and death⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't get mad at me. I'm not the one killing her![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you say that?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Because, if she was that small when they found her, then she wouldn't have been capable of hard labor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, she was useless to them?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, a drunken bureaucrat might keep her as a plaything⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why are you making a fist?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Glare at me all you want, this isn't my fault! It's just a theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where do you think they'd take her?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I have no idea, but the God-Monarch would know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm sorry. Takuya, when it comes to your daughter, you're pretty reckless⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up, leave me alone![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You need to make a decision, fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We've got no choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll just have to ask Kun-Kun to do her best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we stay here any longer, we'll die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to the Imperial Capital. I can think about the rest later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know we'll find a way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. No way.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes. I can't take it anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's covered in cuts and bruises.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her wings are all torn up⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Thanks to her carrying both of us, we made it all the way to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. We already reached her limit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And I⋯)[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're gonna be okay⋯right?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there anything you want me to do?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't just smile at me.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]Thank you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]You've saved me twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You can speak?![%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-We're friends. Of course I helped you.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]My mom thanks you, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mom? You mean that woman?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]Before she died, my mom told me to help you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To⋯help me?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]If only⋯everyone⋯were like you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she saying?)[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]M-My⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't talk anymore. It's okay now.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]I⋯love⋯you a-and⋯ Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I love you, too.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]I loved⋯running around⋯the meadows⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ Let's do it again some time. With Yu-No, too.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]I love Yu-No⋯ I love you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]Let's⋯meet again⋯in the meadows⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We will. So feel better, okay?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]With⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]With⋯you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With me?[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]I want⋯to be⋯with you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]I⋯love⋯you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wake up![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's dead⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's dead⋯?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It was a rather nice lizard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey Takuya, what's wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. Don't touch me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why are your eyes so red? Don't tell me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't even think about teasing me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, whatever. Anyway, we should get ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ready for what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey. What are you planning on doing?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Eating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do we need to eat?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That Nogard is plenty of food. It's right there, after all⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Whoa, don't look so scary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you going to do to her?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't you know?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you thinking?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit messing around, Amanda. I can't let you do that![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because! She brought us all the way here and died for of us![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You don't want to make her death be in vain, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut the hell up![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, just think about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up, just shut up![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda, you knew she was going to die from the very beginning, didn't you? You knew she'd die if she kept flying![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes, I did⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]How⋯how could you⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There was nothing I could do![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Would you rather we'd die in that mine like dogs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I knew it would die. But I much prefer us being alive right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you sacrificed her life instead.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Stop calling it a 「her!」 Nogards are not human.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was my friend![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, you're just emotional right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?! She saved our lives, and this is the treatment she gets in return⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Then⋯ I guess all we can do is lay down our lives right here, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, this Nogard died for you. It went through all that pain to bring you closer to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]We still have a long way to go, though. We can't start off on our journey without securing water and food first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If you shrivel up and die here, the Nogard's death will be completely in vain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That doesn't mean we should⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It said it wanted to be with you, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯are you saying?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I think this is what it meant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It was ready to die. It sacrificed itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To keep us alive?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, it was thanks to both you and the Nogard that we were able to make it this far. I'll follow your orders now, whatever they are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mine?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You can choose to starve here. Or, you can try to fulfill the Nogard's dying wish. It's up to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up to me⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I can't⋯ Not her!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This earthquake is real. No doubt about it, it's happening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me that this earthquake is another one of the God-Monarch's tricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what's real anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Working the mine was just a con, or so Amanda says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said the end of the world wasn't coming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yet, earthquakes are occurring more frequently, causing more and more damage⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the God-Monarch really lying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way for me to know. I do know one thing, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These continuous earthquakes and all the damage they're causing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there some kind of causal relationship between these and the big disaster the God-Monarch mentioned?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the whole wrath of mother nature thing? Just some story made up by the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it all a ruse to capture and imprison those who oppose the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The huge earthquake really did happen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯and everyone died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did everything end up this way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone died because of the earthquake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a huge earthquake like that occur so suddenly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it the rage of mother nature I heard about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm the last person alive in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just an expanse of rubble, piled as high as mountains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The desert sand is blowing all around us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where that mine used to be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The earthquake destroyed everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't sense life anywhere around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all just gravel and rubble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All because of that massive earthquake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where that large mine used to be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯right here⋯
[name]Takuya[line]It was just like that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's just an expanse of rubble, piled as high as mountains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet Amanda is searching over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like hope is running thin⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure there were people sleeping in cells when it hit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They wouldn't have suffered much if they were sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is awful⋯ Everything is destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right over there was the cell we slept in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that big tower is nowhere in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see where it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's completely destroyed, and all that's left is rubble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There were a ton of people working right below it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda's checking out the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's searching over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might not be worth much, but I should take a closer look around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going over there is pointless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't anything left that you could call a tower⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No towers to go to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just look around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Digging isn't going to produce anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything is buried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used to mine in this area⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy, he used to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was his name⋯?
[name]Worker[line]((A lot of people are on your side.))[%p]
[name]Worker[line]((Please do your best.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even him⋯ He must be under this rubble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I'm going to find under this stuff is dead bodies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
