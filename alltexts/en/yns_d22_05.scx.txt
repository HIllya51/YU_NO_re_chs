[name]Takuya[line]What on earth was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I look at it, it won't change. Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some kind of footprints here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they're Kanna's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or Mio's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she was walking around that symbol⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯diligently investigating the rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?
[name]Takuya[line]The footprints stop here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't seem like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa whoa whoa! I'm gonna fall!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* Owwww.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell⋯ Why is there a hole right there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, a hole?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would it be here though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost like a passage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A passage, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like the passage goes deep underground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, could Mio have come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
Heeeeey⋯ Heeeey⋯ Heeeey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it goes pretty deep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's too dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure there was a flashlight in that bag.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might be able to use it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay! I'll go get it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should climb up this for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thankfully, it's not too steep to climb. Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* That sure wasn't fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, there are more rocks falling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. I think that landslide was just covering up this hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So does that mean Mio went through here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, Miss Mio is–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a look at this hole though.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]A hole?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wha⋯ What's going on here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hole.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-Why is there a hole here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's exactly what I want to know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go. I'm going to save Miss Mio and–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't jump the gun, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯ So I guess this is everyone.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is this horrible sight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's exactly what it looks like. There's a hole in the side of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]In there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a good chance.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Mio went in there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mio is in there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure. I spotted what looked like her footprints near the entrance.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What could this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I'd like to know. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're going in to save her, of course.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right⋯ We should probably hurry. The faster we find her, the better chance she's got.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just⋯ I can't believe it. I thought I could stop her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't you think she'd find a way to go even if you tried to stop her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The bag next to the Twin Boulders⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that's Mio's. If it is, that means she went inside without waiting. Every second counts.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is private information, but they will start transporting again early tomorrow morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Even after the accidents?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If we don't find her before then, it'll become a police matter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're going to start transporting again early tomorrow morning.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, it's a cave. Won't it be dangerous?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't let you go alone, can I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk. You're treating me like a kid.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wait just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll come too, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]W-Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we all go, things might end with two tragedies. Someone has to stay here.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]B-But⋯ It's my fault. I want to be the one to save her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't your fault, okay? She just ran off.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No! It is my fault![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I was the one who put that poster up on the bulletin board this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I promised Miss Mio I'd go with her to the coastline last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But when I got there, she was sitting with you, Boss Man⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I didn't think she'd disappear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. You thought I'd drive her toward you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, I know you like groveling, but cut it out.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But, Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not mad.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Do you want me to be mad?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, of course not, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm annoyed, but now I see you in a new light, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'd do anything to get the girl you like to notice you. It's⋯nice.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know me. I don't like passive people.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand people who just stand around slack-jawed, waiting for happiness to find them.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to get her. I'm going in on my own two legs, and I'm getting her out of there with my own two hands.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You overdid it this time, but I like your style. Plus Mio can be a pretty cruel girl.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you so much, Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heh heh. You called that one. I'm impressed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. I meant what I said.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't think all three of us should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I agree.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, please bring me with you. I'll find her or die trying.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm fine either way. But if we run into some kind of problem, my knowledge might help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An awful lot of grass here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing but a bunch of grass growing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing to look at here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anything strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of grass growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same as last night. There's nothing unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know it's some kind of emblem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what is the emblem for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. There was some kind of emblem here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it was carved with a knife.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to be careful from here on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be a good idea to use a Jewel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is just normal grass. It's not going to turn into a bucket no matter how many times I look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, want to graze on it like a cow?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass growing in the gaps between the rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal, rocky area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing out of the ordinary about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is, what was she doing here, bent down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure she was bent down right around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not climbing up, that's for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe I should say I can't climb up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, someone went rock climbing here a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He fell and got badly injured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was said something sparked right in front of his eyes and he lost consciousness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The locals around here said it was a curse from the gods. Thinking about the wrath of gods makes me think about lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earthquakes, lightning, and fires. Oh my![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These craggy rocks are sticking out all over the place. Makes me want to climb it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain. It's pointed up to the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something more to this rocky mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, why don't I look around a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
