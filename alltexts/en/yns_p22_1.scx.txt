[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is completely different from the construction site. It's quiet here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see why this place is a shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The guardian god of Triangle Mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I could see how this atmosphere could make you think about a god.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strangely quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the base of Triangle Mountain, and it looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These boulders always looked weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The two boulders look like they're facing each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're treated as a shrine. They weren't placed this way by anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But for a naturally occurring landmark, they seem strangely intentional.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, it's natural for the human mind to try assigning some kind of meaning to two boulders like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are characters carved into the boulder on the right. Those must have been done by people. They say it was about four hundred years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But we don't know what is carved there. The characters are faded from erosion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And some of them don't even seem to be Japanese.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to my old man, this was the subject of an academic conference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are flowers behind them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're beautiful flowers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But who would put flowers next these boulders?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The boulders are facing each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There were flowers behind them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base is thinner than you'd think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be less than a dozen yards in diameter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They call it a mountain, but it would be more correct to call it a long, thin boulder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But how did it get this shape?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Sword Cape⋯ Sometimes, nature makes some strange stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This craggy mountain is thin around the middle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Staying here like this won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanna stay here a little longer.[%p]
