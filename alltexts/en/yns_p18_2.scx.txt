[name]Takuya[line]The coastline is under construction.[%p]
[name]Constr. Workers[line]*sigh* I should head out early today.[%p]
[name]Constr. Workers[line]That construction director is a real stickler, so I should take a break while I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't seem like it when I looked at it from the rooftop, but this is a pretty large-scale construction job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought they were doing some geological survey for the company's building expansions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Building expansions, huh? Does Ayumi's company make that much money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they do, I wish they'd increase her bonus⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this is a large-scale construction project.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of plausible things about that rocky peak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like there's always strange stories circling around them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Geo Technics, the company Ayumi works for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she's also there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain. That place has a strange ability to attract people to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I guess I'll go to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sakaimachi Academy is right up those stairs to my right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no need to go back there anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to go back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should head home soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's gonna come home late today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like swimming in the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First of all, there's construction going on. Second, I don't have swimming trunks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I can't swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean I can't swim, per se, just that I won't swim right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I can't swim here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I explaining myself to anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not allowed to swim here.[%p]
