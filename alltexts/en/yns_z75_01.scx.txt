[name]Takuya[line]I came out to a strange place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a room full of machinery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I guess that makes sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This operating sound and the heated walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A thick and hard metal floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the mechanical voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All of this is powering the machine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Ryuuzouji said that Yu-No was brainwashed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means this is a brainwashing device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Grand Monarch⋯ System check open⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grand Monarch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could all of this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ The question isn't about whether or not this is a brainwashing device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's about why they put a room like this right behind the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh? You are⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ You're awake.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Daaaad!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a nice charge, as usual.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi, Princess. Awake now?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yep⋯ I was waiting for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Yu-No⋯ It's my Yu-No, for sure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's a full grown adult, but there's no doubt⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I was dreaming about something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Forget it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh Dad⋯ I love you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're okay now. I'm here.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes. I always thought you'd come for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I did, right?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes. You always keep promises.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch⋯ A-Anyway, don't you have any clothes?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you push your chest against me so much⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If I push what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ You're getting stiff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you talking about?! You're my daughter and⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Huh? I meant your facial expression is getting stiff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, you're blushing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ Anyway, let's get out of here.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dangerous here⋯ Let's talk about the details outside.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Thank you⋯ I'm so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm happy that you're safe, too.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Am I important to you, dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course. I wouldn't exchange you for anything. I mean it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, let's go outside. Everything starts from there.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that we've come this far, I think we can figure out a way to escape.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aren't we leaving the castle?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah. I have something to do until morning.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want to sit with me by the fountain?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We haven't sat together like this⋯for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I was always thinking about you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I believe you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't rub against my body like a cat.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Heehee⋯ I love you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. I love you, too.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of father wouldn't love their daughter?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why do you sound so sad?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Because⋯ I'm an adult now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is my heart beating really fast?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez. I've gotta get a hold of myself.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, we'll stay here till the morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And in the morning⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with⋯this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A room covered with iron⋯ No, I should say it's more of a main hall rather than a room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of not fitting in⋯ Why is there such a place behind the altar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a pretty big hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I mean is, the surface isn't made entirely out of metal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A heavy operating sound is echoing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like an emergency light, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, it can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A glass orb⋯or more like a spherical object covered with glass?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's like an emergency light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is an emergency light in such a place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is out of the ordinary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are thin lines carved on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Two hexagons, one large and one small.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are thin lines carved on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something like⋯a hexagonal pattern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The black part is very hot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This black part is super hot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Also⋯it's slightly vibrating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that⋯the sound of the machine running?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Here it is again⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Melgio operation starting in 17,790 seconds⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this voice?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mechanical voice⋯not any human voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ I think I'm starting to understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why this wall is warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Slightly warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall is warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you curious⋯ What this place is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will take a few minutes to go around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is that big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just like a circular dancehall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That is to say, if the wall and floor surfaces were not made of metal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The floor is unexpectedly solid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what kind of metal this is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The floor is pretty hard⋯ Significantly harder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it a metal floor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe the wall is surprisingly thin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like something is inside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how thin the wall is⋯[%p]
