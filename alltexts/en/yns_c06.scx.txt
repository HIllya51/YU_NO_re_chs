[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Kaori probably went home too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Yuuki was looking for me. But where is he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? There's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial classes are over now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means Yuuki must have gone home too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are still quite a few students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is not at school. What about the company building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to deal with school right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just wondering about Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to be here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This hall's as lively as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already summer vacation. What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but darkness that way. I should go see the teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard the teacher is waiting, but where on earth are they going to be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I can't think of too many places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the main hall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's still some students left.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki. It's you. Stop calling me that, would you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I heard some weird noise off in the distance. What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It sounded like a car backfiring. Doesn't that sound like a gun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? You don't look well.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, nothing. Have you seen Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're talking about Mio, she said she's going to cancel a course.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What? Really? She left in the middle of class![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Without permission from the teacher?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah. And now I need to substitute for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll be in trouble if the teacher finds out.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I know. And I definitely don't want to take remedial classes for my remedial classes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure you can sub for Mio with your voice.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It doesn't work that way. I feel sorry for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're too nice.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But Miss Mio is awful. She didn't even tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why should she have to tell you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ugh! It just hurts. I asked Ms. Takeda in the school infirmary, but she didn't know anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's rare for Ms. Eriko to be here.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I should look around a little more. Well then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Mio skipping class?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you want now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What timing. Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just say it casually⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You always skip class. You're the worst![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grr.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think she's worried about me at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't blush⋯ Don't blush.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm down. Just stay calm⋯*sigh*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing. I can't deny that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have something to tell you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, w-wait a second.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I mean⋯ What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you sane?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez! What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the main hall. Remedial classes are still in session.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh⋯ Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I haven't seen you in a long time, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We should probably be a little more formal around each other.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks exhausted.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki&Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, go ahead.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Um⋯ Takuya. I need your advice on something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My advice?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. About Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji?!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're Koudai's son, Takuya, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hello⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Your attendance at remedial classes is a sign of improvement. Good for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's go, Ichijou. What's next on the schedule?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Y-Yes. Next, we're heading to the hotel and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji. Why is he so calm?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I still clearly remember what happened that night at the shrine.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it almost seems like Ryuuzouji doesn't remember anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe this Ryuuzouji isn't the Ryuuzouji that I know?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're kind of out of it. Are you tired?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then, study hard. Koudai is expecting much of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What did he say? I couldn't hear.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seemed important.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, I have to go. I'm in a hurry. Bye![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mitsuki wanted to say something to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many students. Are they participating in club activities?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should find Ayumi and see what she has to say.[%p]
