[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Yuuki said he was going to search around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is he looking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights. You can see all of Sakaimachi from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way Mio's father is home, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's Heights. You can see the whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My house is the big mansion on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. You're the daughter of the mayor, the most prominent person in the city.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't say it like that. I don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's fine, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. Nothing interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A utility pole. Having fun looking at it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not having fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This apartment building always interested me. It's bigger than most.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an expensive-looking building. I wonder what kind of people live there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm human, aren't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Yeah. Very funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get there from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a bird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the coastline over there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The next town is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fact is it feels good just looking at it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You don't have to respond.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The view from here is pretty good too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They say that gazing at the sky will clear your mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kidding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But looking at the sky won't clear away what I went through today.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It clears my mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because you have the mind of an old lady.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looked like an ogre for a second there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way I could get to the ocean from here is to fly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little far from here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey! Stop looking at the ocean and let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at it won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what the people living in this city are thinking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do they live their lives?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many houses. It's distracting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The distraction isn't a big deal, though.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's get going. My house is down there on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People live in each and every one of these houses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And every one of those people is living their own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like me to think like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hm⋯ So even you think about that, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This town never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no guarantee that will always be the case, especially for me now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That was very philosophical of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meiunji Park is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's full of passionate couples at night.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't care about a stupid park right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me, that was a pretty big commotion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what was going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Mio's house. I wonder if she's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are we going to Mio's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care much though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to Mio's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that's Princess Shimazu's house.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going downtown, where the city never sleeps.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, where are you going? That way leads downtown.[%p]
