[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, just like I thought. Mitsuki isn't here either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, she was a part time history teacher. She already quit though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the laboratory. They call it that, but it's really just the teachers' hangout spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, so no one should be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty messy in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels better than having everything be all pristine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki's change of clothes is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯not in here, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some paper cups, and for some reason some extra toilet paper in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's actually quite spacious inside. I bet one or two people could hide in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to be standing around in an empty laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll leave the laboratory.[%p]
