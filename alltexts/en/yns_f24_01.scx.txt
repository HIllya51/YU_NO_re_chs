[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The most talked about company now. And I don't necessarily mean it in a good way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have an appointment or anything. I just kind of showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have an appointment or anything. I just kind of showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I think the coast is clear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be bad if I got chased by the guards again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surprisingly dark. I wish it were brighter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light post. It'll probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime now, so the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lights are shining. It looks like bugs are gathering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's relatively high, and also those are barbed wires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks to be used as a guard fence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it surrounds the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barbed wires at the top of the wall, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's charged with a high-voltage current like in the movies, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't look at it too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of the light post, I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps it is wired in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯ Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics Japan Geological Engineering Laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can climb over it easily, but that might cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it's easy to climb over, that's why I should be cautious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I try going over it, they might shoot me with a laser or something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I could easily go over this railway crossing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But as soon I try going over it, the guards will jump on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anyone in the guard house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They shouldn't complain if someone breaks in when it's like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Best to let sleeping dogs lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll pass for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big antenna⋯ I don't think it's for watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big parabolic antenna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they are doing satellite communication with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dome. But I don't know what they use this for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dome like a planetarium attached to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what they use it for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like my school, the building height doesn't exceed four stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are ordinances that state the maximum height of buildings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is an awfully grim building. Could you really break in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I climb up here, I can probably get to the entrance of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope⋯ I thought I nearly died climbing all the way here, and there's still more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I get to the company building, I'm gonna pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like some kind of directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where I found the 20th page of the document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't find anything in a shrub⋯ Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some difficult mathematical equations and graphs written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's numbered 「20」 at the bottom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the 20th page of a document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a document be in the shrub?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the bushes won't make anything come out of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feels nice with lots of green in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is filled with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think these plants are native to around here⋯still, at least the architect has good taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really matches the building in a nice way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring at the sky won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a clear blue sky. If I keep looking at it, I'll end up having neck pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could just disappear into the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is already inside Geo Technics property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No good. I can't just walk in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The security guard isn't here, but I still can't go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go inside without permission, I'd cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there is something special that I have to do, it's a different story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like now would be a pretty bad time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll do it later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, staying here won't help at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
