[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're not doing construction right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I figured she'd be here, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna always comes to look at the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction is on hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's odd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's usually a sound of crunching and grinding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like they stopped construction. I wonder what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't hear any sirens now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like all that commotion was part of a dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯ What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coast is so quiet at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes it feel like the accident this afternoon never happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like something's burning. I wonder if it's from the accident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What that Toyotomi guy says makes sense, but he still pisses me off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The briefing seemed to have gone a bit awry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope Ayumi's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like something's burning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this smell?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like burning cloth⋯or something. Hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something was definitely burning, that's for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did something happen at the coast?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with that big crowd of people?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a few workers and that construction director, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh! He pushed a girl. I can't believe him![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's that girl?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that Kanna?!)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh. Sorry. I didn't want those hands touching this expensive suit. Now, give me your hand⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. Fine. Stay sitting if that's what you like.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please. Please stop the construction right away.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No matter how deep I dig into my pockets, I'll never find your right to tell me what to do.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, the briefing is beginning shortly. You're one of those protesters, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I'm not.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Anyway, that doesn't matter. However, if you're going to try and stop us, I think you're talking to the wrong person.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Geo Technics has gone through all the legal hoops to properly carry out this construction, you know.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That's right! Don't try to say otherwise![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But there have been lightning strikes.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's just nature. It's not our fault at all.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If you really have a problem, bring it to court. Going through the right steps is how democracy works.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Heh heh, go back to school and get studying, girl.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah, that's what students should be doing. Not slacking off at construction sites.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm asking you to stop for your own sakes.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You think it's the wrath of the gods like the old folks around here say?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The chief is going to give an explanation soon. All we can do is have you listen and hope you'll be convinced of– Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Uuhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What's with this girl?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]She seems out of breath, sir.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. My good looks must have taken her breath away and– Oh![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]She fell. N-Not because of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That bastard!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Toyotomi![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A human.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ah yes, you're the chief's good for nothing stepson, always asking her for money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you must be the porn director.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is wrong with you, pushing Kanna and making her faint like that?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If you saw it, I shouldn't have to explain. I only shook her hand off of me. She was just grabbing at my suit so vehemently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit messing around. She looks like she's in pain.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's got nothing to do with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't appreciate being accused of foul behavior. Now, why don't you try proving that me shaking her hand off and her losing her consciousness are causally related?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. You have no proof. You shouldn't accuse people without proof. First of all, just look at her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Look at the condition she's in. She's sweating and in pain. Do you really think someone would end up like that, just from me shaking their hand off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Actually, he's right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna looks like she's really hurting.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You get my message. Hey, you guys![%p]
[name]Workers[line]Yo![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Let's transport the item! Do it quickly and accurately![%p]
[name]Workers[line]Sure thing! But is everything gonna be okay?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's going to be fine. I⋯no, Chief Arima guarantees that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It may not look like it, but I'm a busy man. I don't have time for the likes of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're just going to leave her like that?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why don't you take care of her then? You must know her, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, if you'll excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He fucking left![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I need to take care of Kanna. Oh yeah, the school is close to here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not too far. I could carry her on my back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko should be in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll take her there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's still under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is still at the office.[%p]
