[name]Takuya[line]The phone is ringing. Who is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, it's on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure it's just Ayumi saying she'll be home late from work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to answer it fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be at this hour? Maybe Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the phone is ringing. I'll answer it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello? This is Arima speaking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Oh, thank goodness Takuya. It's you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((Yeah, you weren't at school, and you weren't answering the phone, so I didn't know what to do.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like we missed each other.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((Right⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you had something urgent to tell me?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((It wasn't that urgent, but⋯ Can you come out right now?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, no problem. Where?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((Mr. Ryuuzouji's house.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! I was just there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((Oh, wasn't Mr. Ryuuzouji's mother at home?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was there. She said you weren't there, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((That's weird. I've been here for a while.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that old woman is losing it a little.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((Anyway, I'm at his house now. Can you come over?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this about that place we were talking about last night? What was it⋯some abandoned building?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((The storehouse.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Is it about that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((Yes, that too.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the teacher there now?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((No, it's just me and his mother.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, that old woman seems okay. All right. I'll leave now.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((I'll be waiting.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I just have to go to Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now isn't the time to be fooling around with stuff.)[%p]
