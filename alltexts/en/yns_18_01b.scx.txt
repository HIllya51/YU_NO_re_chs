[name]Takuya[line]This is the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater to block high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our town is on the right. I guess it's for high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Ayumi's in the plants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants are growing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi wouldn't be among them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a date spot at night before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter where I look, I don't see anyone that looks like Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nor Ryuuzouji⋯ Nor that woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't in the truck, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if they just leave it out here, it'll be bad for the engine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because that ocean breeze never stops blowing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can faintly hear the whispering of the waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is dark and quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is quiet. It's a bit cold for some reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't swimming out there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the proper name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost nobody around here calls it that, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the sights of Sakaimachi. It's known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark. It's night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty late. Ayumi probably isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where she went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the construction site's fence. Apparently they're doing a geological survey inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what I saw from the rooftop, it looked like they're digging up the beach for all its worth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's on the beach.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beach is quiet. Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it'll help, but I should try going to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now I wanna go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like something's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look for Ayumi a little more before I go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sakaimachi Academy is up the stairs on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi would've gone to the school. Why don't I look around here a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it doesn't look like Ayumi's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might have gone back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should go back home! I have to find her fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. There might be someone there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll head to the shrine.[%p]
