[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what are we gonna do in this underground passage?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if we can take this all the way to the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an underground passage, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This city is built around the castle, after all. It's no wonder there's something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An underground passage for emergencies. A run of the mill feature for those in power.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if we can take this all the way to the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty damp in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be careful not to slip and⋯woah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Owowow⋯ I need to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, they're more like glowing ores than lanterns.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, it's not the actual ore that's glowing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like the ores are all alight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this some sort of optical illusion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you can never be too careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not even that huge earthquake could cause this place to collapse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, you can never be too careful. So that's just what I'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If that's how it is, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll proceed with caution.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. Let's be more careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on a second. Should I really be rushing ahead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't go to the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, to the left we go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa there⋯ The left side is collapsed, so I can't go that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must have been that earthquake from before. I wouldn't be surprised if the roof caved in, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I can't go that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's be careful about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to rush.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go outside, I might get caught by those Royal Guards.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is no good. They might be up there still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A priestess, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Poor woman, being tricked like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They said they'd take me directly to the God-Monarch and sentence me to death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They don't even care about my connection to Amanda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just like she said, though. All they have to do is capture Amanda and put her to death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The resistance is so weak right now, it's hard to even call it a resistance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The resistance might not even be a problem for the God-Monarch much longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman said she was a priestess⋯
[name]Takuya[line]She hasn't realized she's been tricked into this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why doesn't she see it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's just that for hundreds, no, thousands of years the same old trick has been going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit⋯ That woman is going to become another victim of the God-Monarch's lust for control.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She certainly was beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She almost looked like Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she escaped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Amanda get away clean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it hadn't been for that earthquake, we both would've been caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda's comrades must have been caught all together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I was counting on them, but something seems off about it.[%p]
