[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch⋯ Looks like Ayumi isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I try looking for her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi wouldn't break promises⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a big courtyard⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The garden is refreshing in the morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this is a hobby of the God-Monarch, I might hate it. But if this is a hobby of Ayumi's, I would understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯ Is Ayumi the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It makes me want to lie on the grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see many windows⋯but I don't see Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there are people in each of those windows?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She told me that this castle only has a few people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi said that?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are a lot of pillars.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There should be an altar straight ahead.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The corridor⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is where I tried to cut down Ayumi yesterday.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If you go there, you'll get to the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard it's drinkable⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's clean water⋯ Very clear.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It seems drinkable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Are you going over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ I should go.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, I haven't seen her.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, you're just wandering around aimlessly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, be quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We haven't seen Ayumi yet⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No is right next to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not looking for Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think I'm at the promised place and time but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see her.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Ayumi yet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't she say yesterday⋯to meet here again tomorrow morning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's now morning⋯which I think she was referring to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see her anywhere.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Morning bowel movement?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
