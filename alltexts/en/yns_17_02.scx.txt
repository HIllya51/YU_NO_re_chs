[name]Takuya[line]The light is on, but I don't see anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know where to start. What do I look for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Mitsuki say something about this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had no idea it was like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He mentioned rebuilding. Was he talking about this too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should keep moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't that many lights. I should watch my step.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now I've hit my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is taking forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm right, this direction will lead me to the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This passage is connected to the back of the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was Mitsuki talking about this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a room in the back of the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did Mitsuki see there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an iron door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can smell the soil, trees, and grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the smell of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dull sound echoing on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that on the other side?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a little noise here, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From this wall?[%p]
*ting ting ting*[%p]
⋯[%p]
*ting ting ting*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Other than the tapestry hanging on it, it's an ordinary wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure, but this wall seems to be a slightly different color.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's definitely strange, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong with being strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The tapestry is on the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall is a shade of white.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal wall behind the tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it slightly more white than the other wall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about this feel unnatural.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no sense of unity here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it was recently painted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is some painting on the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somehow, it is not a pleasant picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The subjects in it are suffering in fire or something. Is it a religious painting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture in the form of a tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little bit dirty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's in the middle?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an ordinary wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Compared to the wall in the middle, it's a slightly dull color.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can feel years and years in this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There seems to be no meaning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some letters are written here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's Chinese characters. I can't read it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ordinary families have nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a transom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's very common in Japanese-style homes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no tool to cut it down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is a big pillar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what will happen if I cut this down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I want to try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are several on the ceiling of this mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a beam.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The large rings in the wood grain make it clear these came from immense trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The height of the ceiling would suggest there's a second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I should walk around the house too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the moment I came in here, I had the urge to walk around a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a closet, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there nothing in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this a tea closet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I open it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This may as well be a vacant house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hardwood floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to slide across it in my socks like a kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The floor is hardwood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The best way to describe it would be to call it hardwood flooring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the living room of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems kind of unnatural though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I guess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any items to use here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time.[%p]
