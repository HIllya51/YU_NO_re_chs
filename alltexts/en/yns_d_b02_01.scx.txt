[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]All I can hear is the sound of dripping water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I look around too much, I'll slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is wet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah. Be careful not to sliiiiip![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's slippery⋯ Be more careful.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the dampness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be from the water dripping down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I should go back⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The exit. Let's go back for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
