[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing⋯never mind. Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is my heart beating really fast?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You've always been so blunt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a compliment or an insult?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's a compliment. You're so awkward around women, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't apologize, you idiot. You don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha! You idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](At least Mitsuki agrees. Well, I think she agrees.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she smiling like that? Maybe she understands, but disagrees?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think I feel a little better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was actually trying to talk to you about the doctor though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The doctor?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about him?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He's been strange lately, but it's fine. I'll do something about it. Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I should thank you. I embarrassed you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't be an idiot. Just let it go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not a big deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Shall we go home together? I'm heading downtown. We can walk together for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We talked for a long time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels late already.)
[name]Mitsuki[line]You've been distant since the incident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I haven't seen you much. And now here we are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And what about that girl?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What girl?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, come on. Mio. She likes you, doesn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. There's no way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! You're just as oblivious as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean? We⋯got caught in an awkward situation. That's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what? I can't help that the door opened like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! You should have seen the look on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! You looked pretty ridiculous yourself, you know.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mio's face was so red. She was furious⋯ Then she looked sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha! She was so surprised, she couldn't even speak. And I've had a new nickname ever since.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, does Mio take her anger out on you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. She totally hates me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You little liar. Mio told me she likes you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*flinch* Why would you say that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She told me not to say anything, but Mio came to talk to me after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's that look on your face? You look like you got caught doing something naughty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! Anyway, that's when she told me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What did she say?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're making that face again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry up and say it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]「I sort of knew about your relationship with Takuya, Ms. Ichijou. I'm not going to tell anyone, but please stop.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Surprised?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! You're quite the lady-killer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid. Sure, Mio said she wanted to talk to me about something⋯but it's nothing serious.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She wants to tell you she likes you, dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She's a good one. So innocent. Not like me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say that. There's nothing wrong with you, Mitsuki. You have your own unique charm.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I thought you'd say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But to be honest, I was worried you wouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are those tears?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm glad you're happy. Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little late for that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I mean, when your father died⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's not talk about the past.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was only a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like a lot longer to me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were losing it a little back then. But there was nothing you could do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound disappointed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well I was. You punched your advisor, skipped your classes, and quit your club.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That stuff just happened around the same time. It was a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! I was just thinking that was a cute excuse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. You were the one chasing Ryuuzouji around, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, you're right. I was tired, too. Impossible and fictional love⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds like something out of a television show.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Heehee! I certainly felt like a heroine in a TV drama.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ryuuzouji is single, isn't he?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sort of. He lives together with his mother, but apparently he and his wife are separated. He's married on paper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think you and I were both lonely and needed someone else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]With the way I felt about your father, I completely panicked when he died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't go so far as to say I was out of my mind, but I wouldn't deny it either.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not really strange that we sought each other out. Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Back then⋯ I felt like I was burning with love for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Every day, all I could think of was you. In the bath, while I was eating, even while I was brushing my teeth![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of example is that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wasn't our first time in my room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I said I don't want to talk about the past.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think I was arguing with my old boyfriend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I just stopped by and there was a guy there. I didn't know what to do.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He was drunk, and you went at him all fists and rage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did that, didn't I?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it was only because he was saying bad things about you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was really happy then. I was smitten with a younger man. That's why he was so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Was I your first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No comment.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's what it felt like. I'd be happy if I was your first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're not supposed to ask that kind of question.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you regret it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. I learned a lot.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't ask me that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were so innocent then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't make that face. It was a compliment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No man is happy having the past dug up like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. I'm no good at talking about the past.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how I look at her, I still just see Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a while since we've stared at each other like this.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong with my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing at all! It's lovely and gorgeous.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah, same as always then. Ha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so mature.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair looks good cut in a bob with that slight wave to it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's something only a sophisticated woman could pull off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter what Mitsuki wears, it suits her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whether she's wearing casual clothes or professional, she always looks good.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course, independent women seem to make any clothes look good. Must be something about them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something stuck to the bulletin board.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you have any plans?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What did I say?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I won't⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She yelled at me like I was a kid.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were trying to do something just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I wasn't trying to touch your breasts at all.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just as blunt as always, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, she just dodged me like it was nothing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Blouses that accentuate the bust are the best.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Buns? No. Biscuits, marshmallows? No. Rice balls?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ah! I just can't properly put this into words.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Are you hungry? Why are you talking about food?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, y-you heard me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her breasts are pressing against her blouse like two huge, pillowy rice balls.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a weird choice of words.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her voluptuous breasts are squeezed tightly within her blouse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I sound like a gross old man. This is pathetic.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really want to see those mountains, but this isn't the best time to be looking there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But my eyes are just drawn right to that spot. This is sad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm saying the same stuff I always do.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're always so frank. Seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just what I said. You're really forward. My eyes are up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm shameful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A little deeper. A little deeper. A little more![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Take a picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It'll last longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Yeah. Very funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's no good. I'd have to bend over like a perverted old man to get a good look at her skirt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, what if she sits on the desk in that short skirt? She sat!)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you stooped over all weird like that? Does your back hurt or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, but who has more adult charm, her or Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko has the body, but Mitsuki has the elegance.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're smiling a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Really?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were sizing up the goods, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're so bounc–I mean, of course not![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh, come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is, um⋯*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a book full of paper. I don't have to read it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a laboratory. It's got all the books and papers I could ask for.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We used to study here together a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such perfect skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Look at that desk Mitsuki is sitting on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only she were sitting on my lap instead⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's sitting up on the desk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only she were sitting on my lap instead⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mitsuki. She's such a mature, elegant woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a while since we've met like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the laboratory.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kinda nervous being alone like this with Mitsuki.)[%p]
