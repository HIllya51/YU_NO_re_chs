[name]Takuya[line]I haven't been resting much in my room lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to rest now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it came from the window. It's like someone's throwing pebbles at it from outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt children would be out this late playing tricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]I'm right here. Down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Down where?[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Right. Here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa!!![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a long way down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that doesn't matter right now.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hello![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you think you're doing?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Should I not be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't say that, but what about the commotion down on the coastline?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayuuuu⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Just take a deep breath.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*⋯*gasp*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯so, uhm, you came back from⋯work?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oops, sorry. I'm not really back, per se. I just came for a change of clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A change of clothes?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. Things at work got a little out of hand. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out of hand? Did a robber break in or something?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no, that's exactly what happened.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. I'm sure it'll be in the news tomorrow morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe someone would break into Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me either. According to the security guards, it was a man and a woman who broke in together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A man and a woman?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]One of them looked pretty risqu⑮, and the other looked like a student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, could that have been Kaori and⋯ I?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A pair of burglars. That's a pretty thought out attack.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I had nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah, you just got chased down and⋯ Mfff. Hey! Why are you holding my mouth shut?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please quit talking.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, who's that behind you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hi, we met in the studio once. My name is Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh. Conducting late-night interviews, are you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's not like that. However, there's a high chance that the theory of it being a team of a male and female culprits is spot on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry, Takuya. I have to go now. Sorry I don't have time to chat with you, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Please, don't worry about it. I'll make myself at home here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi looked like she was in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I guess that's how it is when you're the chief of an office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori, did you really go into Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* There's no proof of that. That means there's no way of knowing it was me, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The guards were chasing you, weren't they?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Weren't you also running away from the guards?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That makes us even.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So you want to hear my story?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your story?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah. I've been wanting to have a sit-down with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you know me pretty well.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Of course I do. You're Dr. Arima's son, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I can't take part in your silly investigations. Try someone else.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Silly? Really? I think it'll be good for both of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Even if it's about what Ayumi does at her company?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see I've caught your attention. I'd like to discuss your father as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just what exactly does she know?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wanna take a little walk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't really want to stand around talking. How about the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know that's a nest for sex-crazed couples, right?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then we won't stand out at all. Everyone thinks of a man and woman together as a couple, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you telling me that the contents of our conversation would draw attention to us?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ooh, you're sharp. That's exactly right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]All right. I suppose if you're worried about tarnishing your sparkling reputation, Mary, I don't mind going somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mary? Like Virgin Mary?! You do know I'm a man, don't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]How about up the hill? It's just in front of the park, so it'll be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going to be fine, exactly?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'd much rather go down to the quiet coastline, but you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beggars can't be choosers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I guess I should listen to what Kaori has to say.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It won't be too late to judge after that.)[%p]
