[name]Takuya[line]Sh-She's dead⋯ She's dead![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The chain is swaying⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must've been the source of the noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is it swaying though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There can't be any wind blowing around in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this old lady just hung herself a few seconds ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guh⋯ I don't even want to think about it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm starting to get a strange feeling about all this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gah!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Footsteps! I hear something outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone must have been in the storehouse![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They looked inside and quickly ran away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're running away⋯ I need to go outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The chain is swaying⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must've been the source of the noise⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is where the sound was coming from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She hung herself on the chain suspended from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never would have thought someone would hang themselves with a chain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks like she was in agony⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must've suffered a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a far cry from a peaceful death⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She died with a look of agony on her face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is like something out of a nightmare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no doubt about it. It's the old lady. Ryuuzouji's mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you do this⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use⋯ She's dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no way I can talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll never talk again⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, enough with the jokes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she actually talked back to me in this situation, I'd piss my pants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sash on her kimono is very proper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the sash on her kimono.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I read in some weird book that a woman hopes her kimono will look appropriate when she dies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a diary in her hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hand is cold and stiff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems to be holding something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-The old lady's hand⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably really cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems to be holding something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There wasn't much I could read in it, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems to be Ryuuzouji's journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Ryuuzouji in this journal seems way different than the Ryuuzouji I know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left to read⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something written on the last page.[%p]
「I will die soon⋯so finally this journal⋯」[%p]
「⋯ I can't stand anymore.」[%p]
「My eyes hurt⋯」[%p]
「My ears hurt⋯」[%p]
「My chest hurts⋯」[%p]
「She is evil⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Ryuuzouji trying to say?[%p]
「⋯you think it will be?!」[%p]
「I can't believe this. She's the manifestation of evil itself.」[%p]
「This isn't some kind of literary allusion. She is truly the devil.」[%p]
「⋯is it⋯frightening⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The words are too blurred to read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The diary page Mitsuki showed me must be from this part of the journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯the devil?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does he mean she's 「truly the devil?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like he's mentally deranged, calling someone the devil⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who 「she」 is?[%p]
「Due to her appearance, my curiosity for research and vigor in general has made great leaps forward.」[%p]
「However, at the same time, it has put me in a remarkable amount of danger. It was⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The page is ripped, and I can't read the next part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to read in the dark⋯ I only have the moonlight to read by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should read this inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all discolored and hard to read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks the same as the other scrap of paper⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means this must be the source of the torn page.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try skimming through it⋯[%p]
「I gained a strong conviction here. No. I'm not quite convinced yet, but the theory does hold a high possibility of being true.」[%p]
「Her theory and the proof behind it is incredible⋯ It reminds me of my school days when I was deeply involved in Asian philosophy.」[%p]
「Mandala are a part of Asian philosophy.」[%p]
「In Sanskrit, it means to give true essence. It is a manifestation of the true universe according to one's own philosophy.」[%p]
「I know this, because I have personal experience with this philosophy.」[%p]
「Her theory is comprised of something very similar to Eastern philosophy. So much so that I can't help but be interested.」[%p]
「The world humans perceive is formed through various impressions gained by intelligence, turning it into time, space, and causality.」[%p]
「My close friend and rival, Dr. Arima, based his research on the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer.」[%p]
「My other colleague, Professor Imagawa, tried finding the secrets to Sakaimachi using Schopenhauer's physics and mathematical models.」[%p]
「As my colleagues continued progressing in their research, all I could do was watch⋯」[%p]
「That is now no longer the case. In proving her theory, I have made great strides forward⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Proving her theory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This pronoun frequently appears in Ryuuzouji's journal⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki said she found some pages of a diary near the well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that have something to do with this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should read it, or at least take it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this? It's like some kind of book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, something's written here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A diary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be a journal of some sort.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A journal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should take a look at it, see what it has to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on⋯*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant, pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get it. She's got a tight grip.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I read something about this in a book once⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A dead body goes stiff a few hours after death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the only thing I can do is peel her fingers back one by one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is blasphemy in the eyes of the Buddha. Forgive me, old woman.[%p]
*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There we go. Got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The signature⋯it reads 「Kouzou Ryuuzouji.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the headmaster's full name. There's no doubt about it. This is Ryuuzouji's journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I read it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's floating in the air⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She hung herself by the chain suspended from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no mistaking it. It's Ryuuzouji's mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She gave me the key⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would she do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside a dark storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside a dark storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe someone killed themselves in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it's not the time to use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here, right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. Is it the time to use that?[%p]
