[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go left, it's the coastline, and the school gate is to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already noon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I was supposed to meet Mio in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was gonna show me a bunch of papers about Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lab, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go left, it's the coastline, and the school gate is to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's where I'm supposed to meet Mio. I should hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door. I already have Mio's book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city is straight down the road on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door. Okay, I turn right at that corner to go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and get that book Mio borrowed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand, but that's what's written.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」 is what it says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some more writing⋯[%p]
「There are also other places where your 『Current Coordinates』 are noted, so please reference that as well.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sign. What does it say?[%p]
「This sign displays your current completion rate.」[%p]
「Your current junction discovery rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As much as humans destroy nature to put up man-made structures, they can't get away from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a strange connection we have with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants in my house, as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sexy fliers inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it would matter if there were. It'd just make me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, are there any fliers for video deliveries?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh! This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electricity bill. We have been using the AC lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the gate. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a gated entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tiled wall. It's not made of bricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall that surrounds the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why do Japanese people want to surround everything with walls?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The spaces are small enough as they are, but everyone puts up walls. Making it even smaller.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna clean it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room's window is on the left, the right one is my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They might start getting dirty if we don't clean them soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A normal antenna. The TV signal isn't bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We need a satellite dish to get satellite TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The antenna for the local channels. It's still the age of analog broadcasting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect 「upper middle class」 house imagined by us middle class people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house where Ayumi and I live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dark night sky. Like it'll swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't waste time staring into space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A clear blue sky with nice sunshine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, not a bad day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. There's not many people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. Probably because the ocean is relatively close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the city in the distance. It's the only busy downtown area in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going back downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope I don't run into Mio's father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going back downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, she must be tired of waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry to the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, am I going back downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline. Construction must be on hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was an accident at the coastline last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I happened to be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I was supposed to meet Mio in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get to Triangle Mountain from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's where I should be going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just left my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do at the house. Oh well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be awkward if Ayumi's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I tell her I spent the night at a girl's house, Ayumi will probably faint.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think my destination is inside my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go back to the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I was looking for Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. I promised Mio I'd meet her in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's at school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She did say she was pulling the night shift tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already have the book Mio borrowed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I have to head to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to get Mio's book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will ringing my own door bell accomplish?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going in the house, I should just walk in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No more.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I rang it again for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it for no reason.[%p]
