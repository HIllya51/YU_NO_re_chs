[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Ms. Eriko walking around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just saw her in front of the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that teacher doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As usual, Ms. Eriko is not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the light is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means, someone was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtain is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is sleeping at this time of day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That teacher's got a case of wanderlust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That teacher's got a case of wanderlust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nobody's around.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The bed right in front of me. Look, over there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The curtain is closed. That's odd.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is someone sleeping?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko said she has a staff meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What was with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, thank you. Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, Mio. I'll send it over to you as soon as I find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio. Why are you in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I asked Ms. Takeda for consultation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A consult with the school physician? You haven't gotten your period yet?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, it's not about that, you idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her slaps are getting quicker every day.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That one was your fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You shouldn't say such a thing to a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish Mio were the kind of woman that didn't take things to heart. She's too tough.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't understand women at all, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, fine. Adios.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have something to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's about remedial classes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the school infirmary, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it, where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no reason for Ayumi to come to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As the security guard says, Ayumi went home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no reason for Ayumi to check out the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means Ayumi is not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the school infirmary. Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
