[name]Takuya[line]It is my old man's study, so the name plate matches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「Father's Study.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who call themselves 「Father」? Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty stupid to just stand around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I do something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of my father's study. Now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock, knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saying it aloud won't help. No one's there![%p]

[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, of course.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a thief ransacked the study, searching for something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a thief ransacked the study, searching for something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know it was locked last night. So what happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was surprised for a second, but I'm the one who unlocked it. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Staying here won't do me any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back to the living room.[%p]
