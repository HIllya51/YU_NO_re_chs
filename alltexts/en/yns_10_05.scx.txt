[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That was scary.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she out on the roof all alone?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'll be going then. Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you for the student handbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna left.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I saw that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know that dumb-ass voice⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm so jealous of you, Boss Man. Cozying up to a cute girl like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you spying on us?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'd prefer to say I happened to notice you. I saw you exchanging handbooks, and I was all like, daaamn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dumbass. I just gave her back the student handbook that she dropped.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, really.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So, eh? What then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh heh, so, how far?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean how far?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm talkin' about that girl just now.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ouchie. That's not nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is nothing impure happening between Kanna and I. Always pure and beautiful. That's my motto.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]More and more beautiful is my motto. Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What's with the long face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's killing me.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that STI flaring up on you again?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Who said I have an STI? I'm talking about that girl just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about her?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You said Kanna. Do you mean Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know her? Mio would be mad to find out you're paying attention to another girl.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Th-That's not it. It's uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why's he being so evasive?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'll be going then. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is that all you wanted to talk to me about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Didn't I have something to give to Kanna?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't really have anything else to talk to her about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, can I ask you something?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you remember what happened last night?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, did you come to the shrine last night?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Shrine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's just what they call it around here. It's at Triangle Mountain, you know, at the bottom of Sword Cape? We can see it from here.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was pretty late, but I thought I saw you there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. I wasn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was pretty sure it was her I saw there but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was I just imagining things?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're the same as me, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're always alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, I see.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. You're always sleeping on the rooftop during breaks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I hear you're not participating in club activities, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's really keeping up on me. Sheesh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? But I guess that means Kanna has been thinking about me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pardon me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like you're always alone.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Even when everyone's goofing around, I notice you just looking outside.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like you talk to your classmates during breaks much, either. Are you having a hard time fitting in?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. There was this lovely person, though, who suddenly started undressing to welcome the new transfer student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp* Oh yeah, that did happen.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]*giggle* It's nice to know there are some interesting people here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if I should be happy about that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always looks so sad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Am I just imagining things?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she doesn't seem like a gloomy girl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How should I put it? It's like there's a mysterious aura around her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She had that headband on when she transferred here, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems more of an accessory than something practical.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always wear that headband.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. It's to keep my hair in place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's girly about things like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she doesn't seem like a gloomy girl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How should I put it? It's like there's a mysterious aura around her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so silky, I can almost hear it shimmering.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, it's so silky, it's like cuticles.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That didn't make any sense at all. What are cuticles, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like it goes down to her hips in the back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she doesn't seem like a gloomy girl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How should I put it? It's like there's a mysterious aura around her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd like to see her in another outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Actually I think I did see her in casual clothes before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](At the bottom of Triangle Mountain.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna's uniform.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even a plain uniform like this looks tidy when she wears it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she doesn't seem like a gloomy girl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How should I put it? It's like there's a mysterious aura around her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna's right hand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just want to hold it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She might be on her guard a little.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hand pressed to her chest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she doesn't seem like a gloomy girl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How should I put it? It's like there's a mysterious aura around her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]

[name]Takuya[line](How should I put it? It's like there's a mysterious aura around her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I said stop it, come on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I might scare her and make her transfer to another school.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, is it really a good idea to be looking there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just transferred here. Now that I think about it, it was actually over a month ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She still almost never talks to anyone in class.)[%p]
