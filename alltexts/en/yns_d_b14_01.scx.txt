[name]Takuya[line]It's a dead end. I can't go forward.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should we do? Should we go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could push, pull, even bite this rock. It's just not gonna budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing we can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A huge rock is blocking our way forward.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It doesn't look like we can go any further.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how far we go, the walls are still damp⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wet here too. The water seems to be seeping out of the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It feels a little humid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's nothing I can do here now.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah. Let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That item won't help me now.[%p]
