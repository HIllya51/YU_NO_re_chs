[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antique-style light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty old-looking light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it really sets the atmosphere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll want to go to the bathroom if I keep looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bathroom's in the back on the left side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like going to the bathroom right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could increase entropy here, but the waitress would yell at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, it's incredibly unnatural for entropy to be small and ordered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meaning this caf⑮ is breaking the laws of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I'm the only one who would think this much about simple tables and chairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tables and chairs are evenly spaced around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entropy is extremely low.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, there is a tendency of things to move from order to disorder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light hanging down like some kind of plump eggplant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the caf⑮'s style of choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These curtains are rather unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rolling screens have become more popular recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are paintings on the walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone said that art isn't determined by the people, but by a bunch of brokers somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand that, I guess. I can't see what's so good about this painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some paintings on the walls, but I have no clue what they're depicting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an innocuous painting.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wait, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I'm Akemi.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wait, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I'm Akemi.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wait, Mayor Shimazu's daughter?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Never even heard of her.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Do I know someone named Shimazu?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Isn't that the mayor's last name? He has a huge house down below the Heights. Oh, I wish he'd make me his lover.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, how I wish you wouldn't say things like that right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Things are so dangerous lately. I hope I locked up my house.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]There was a burglary at a big company down on the coastline last night.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What a dangerous world we live in today.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Yes, it's very dangerous.[%p]
[name]Man[line]By the way, this is it for my scene.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Sorry, we're talking right now.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Yeah, she's talking with me. This is my only scene.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Didn't that company hold a briefing today?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Apparently if you attend, you'll get paid and get a free lunch too.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I was so thrilled at the idea that I went.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]They told me all I had to do was yell 「I disagree」 and I would get 1000 yen an hour.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Actually, you look like a guy I saw there.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Sorry, I don't feel like talking to anyone now.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I'm not in the mood to talk about girls.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh* The company I'm working at might go under tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Where do I work at? Geo Technics, of course.[%p]
[name]Man[line]With accidents day after day, it's no wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]They say the construction is on break, but it's pretty much cancelled.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Well, I guess it's an opportunity to relax.[%p]
[name]Man[line]You have to go with the blend when you come to a caf⑮ at night.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh* Construction was called off for the day. I'm just trying to relax a little.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What does that company even do?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I was working construction on the coastline.[%p]
[name]Man[line]But I've never been more pissed off in my life. That chief continued with the construction and caused another accident.[%p]
[name]Man[line]The briefing they held didn't explain jack. What a slipshod company.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What? A woman with braids and glasses?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Weren't you saying you like the stuck-up princess-type before? You're a skirt chaser, aren't ya?[%p]
[name]Man[line]What? A woman with braids and glasses?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Weren't you saying you like the stuck-up princess-type before? You're a skirt chaser, aren't ya?[%p]
[name]Man[line]If you're looking for a maid caf⑮, there's one outside up on the right. Oh, that's not what you're asking?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Sorry, I don't know.[%p]
[name]Man[line]A girl with curly hair?[%p]
[name]Man[line]A girl that's a little strong-willed, is obsessed with history, and is a princess who's a little aggressive?[%p]
[name]Man[line]That's a very specific assortment of traits. It must be tough going to concept caf⑮s.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I should get a pic with Akemi today.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Now's not the time to think about that though.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I'm wondering what kind of pose to do for it.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Don't look at me like that.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What, you want to know what I've been talking about?[%p]
[name]Man[line]It was a sigh. That's it.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I'm having a tough time right now.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Man[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Caf⑮s and greenery are completely inseparable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is pretty empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fancy, yet it's not that crowded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a jukebox.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like song number 1 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 2 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 3 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 4 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 5 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 6.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 7 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 8 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 9.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 10 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can play whatever song you like in the caf⑮ by pressing the button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want it to stop, hit the red EXIT button on the bottom right and things will go back to normal.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm gonna go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song really makes this place feel like a caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of when I talked to Ms. Eriko on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song has a somber mood to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song puts me on edge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me want to jump for joy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song brings back so many memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm moving outside when I listen to this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason I want to call for my big brother when I hear this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The poppy rhythms in this song sound so fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me feel like I need to stay up all night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of that one game.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listening to this song makes me realize there's some strange music in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, pressing that isn't going to do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Press the button.[%p]
