[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by course adjustment, by the way?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The curriculum here is a bit different from my old school's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. So it's like you're combining the two.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At your old school–[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A student handbook? Let's have a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna Hatano.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna's⋯[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that makes sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I'm the only one stuck here thanks to skipping classes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, you know what?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe the powers above heard my wish to see you again.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would you think if I said that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Interesting, it's just as I heard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]About how you talk the same way to all the girls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of irresponsible person would say something like that about me?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I think it looks really good on Kanna⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Sakaimachi Academy uniform, I mean.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The school rules say you can choose to wear a uniform or not, but most girls choose to wear it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which makes me happy.)[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Um, is everything okay?[%p]
