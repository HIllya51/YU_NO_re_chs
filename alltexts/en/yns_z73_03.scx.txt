[name]Takuya[line]I didn't think I'd meet Ms. Eriko in this world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's ask her a bunch of stuff.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know his warrior house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. That was the source of all that Tatari commotion, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The warriors of that house had an interdimensional transportation device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The device is broken now. He was working on a way to travel to a different dimension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that's why he was after the Reflector![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Possibly. Eventually, he came here to Dela Grante. Though I haven't found him yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I let him go.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯ He was strung up in the castle dungeon. I let him go in exchange for Yu-No's location.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see⋯ So it was beneath the castle. Hrmph. Pretty smart of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I recall that guy saying that if we stay here, we'll be able to escape.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, he also said something like, he should take action soon.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If he'd stayed there, I wouldn't have found him⋯ Why did he make a move?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no clue.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Decades pass in the blink of an eye for that guy. It would have been better for him if he could get me off his tail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he still made his move⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That means there was some reason for him to make a move. I don't know what that is though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, does that mean he's scheming something?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No⋯ It probably has something to do with his own life. Well, let's go check out the underground dungeon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Right now?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You can go to sleep. You need to get up early tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This is my problem. So don't worry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her problem⋯?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You can go sleep in my bedroom with Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-With Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong? You're her parent, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah. But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just saw her again for the first time today⋯ And she looks so incredible⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* (Geez.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You can use whatever you need in the house. After all, it isn't mine to begin with.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got some guts.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Tomorrow morning⋯ Takuya, I hope you can solve this problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh yeah, this is for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure? Isn't this something valuable?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's from the Dimension Inspection Bureau. It's a write-off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, then I'll save my thanks.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way⋯ I want to ask you a question.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]As you wish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said that the needle points toward the flow of the event element, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute, what if we go to the event source you mentioned earlier?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What happens if you use a compass magnet at the North Pole?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe⋯ Bye now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Ms. Eriko. I have another question![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That assistant you mentioned about earlier⋯ Is she⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, if the assistant loved the man, I am sure she wanted to see the same thing he saw.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By working for the Dimension Inspection Bureau, maybe?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Go to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things are happening so fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, I'm really confused.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need some time to think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there's anything⋯waiting for us there?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There might be something, or there might be nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting. It stimulates my intellectual curiosity.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Back in the day⋯well, back in the day in my terms, there was a man. He was a researcher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In your world?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was he researching?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How to come closer to God's domain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If we retrace events and reach the root of it all, what could exist there? This man was thinking exactly what you just asked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. That's an interesting topic.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's not about the physical body, but about how to project your consciousness. You wear a small helmet and watch pseudo-images projected on sunglasses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that only the person's consciousness retraces through events.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That is what it seems to do. I don't know the details.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what happened after that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The man was doing his research together with his assistant, who also happened to be his lover. Together they tried to verify if it worked.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The readings on the event counter continuously rose. In other words, his consciousness seemed to retrace events at a rapid rate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, 「seemed」?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Because no one really confirmed it. Only those who were wearing the devices saw it happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, the images gradually started to blur⋯ The assistant thought the machine was malfunctioning, and manually stopped the device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what about the man?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He remained on the device. His face stiffened as the readings on the instruments continued to increase to one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand. But the expression on his face was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fear⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a thought.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry, but you are wrong. It was bliss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bliss?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In addition to the expression of bliss, the man gradually began to say incomprehensible phrases⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]「Myself, who is surrounded by light, is warm and cold⋯」[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]「⋯ I may be able to grasp the truth of the universe as if⋯ No, I am already a part of it.」[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The assistant just stood and watched as the man spoke words that made no sense to her. She couldn't stop him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she was overcome by curiosity too.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. The woman also wanted to know the event source.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what happened after that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The measurement reading was off the charts. The value was pointed at infinity, and then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The device exploded. Overloaded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what about the man?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He was dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, his face looked surprisingly peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry for the long story⋯ It's already late. You should sleep here tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take your offer. And I'm also open to sleeping next to you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, heh. You looked so serious, so I thought you could use some kidding around.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna do what I said I'd do. Ayumi is at the castle. I'm going to see her tomorrow morning.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. By regulation, I'm not supposed to be involved in matters other than my duty when in another dimension. So, I won't be able to help you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your willingness means enough to me. The tough life of a government official, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly⋯*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, you said you were chasing a criminal, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I did. A Class A dimension criminal who is fleeing using an interdimensional transportation device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An interdimensional transportation device⋯ Is there such a thing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The Reflector that you have⋯ It's small, but you can move between dimensions. It's like an enhanced version of that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There was a person named Ryuuzouji in your world⋯ Of course you know him, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He's the one I'm after.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second. What did you just say?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ryuuzouji is a dimensional criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryu-Ryuuzouji is⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]To be precise, the man who claims to be Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does that mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What exactly is⋯at the event source?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* Do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, of course![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Actually, I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Awh, don't make that face. It's a world that everyone knows exists, yet no one has ever been before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's God's domain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A scientist like you, talking about God?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A scientist like me knows the limit of science that human beings can process.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there a limit to science?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of limit?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There are certain borders that can not be crossed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what is it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Being human. We have limitations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* So, I should ask you. In what way are you using the word science? What exactly is science to you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Science is⋯to experiment, to observe, and to review the result.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. Who observes it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Humans do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. In other words, science can never exceed the ability of observation by human beings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Einstein's theory of relativity and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle are no exception.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the limit?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. It is impossible to eliminate the influence of the observer from the experiment. And in that sense, it shows the limitation of methods used in natural science.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]For science to be called science, a human being must be present to observe and then perceive the matter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, as long as we are human, a limitation exists.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. That's why a materialistic scientist like me would want to assume the objective truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The absolute truth with no room for intervention by human subjectivity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The truth that speaks all about everything in the world, all things in nature. I am sure it exists somewhere in this universe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean that⋯the truth exists somewhere in this universe?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. The truth that can explain everything. All fragments of doubt melt away in front of the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I call the collection of truth God, in a literal sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The collection of truth⋯is God.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The event source is the source of any parallel world, including the source of the universe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beginning of this world?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Or you may say: the bounds of the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The⋯bounds⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. The beginning of everything, and the furthest point of possibilities. The bounds of the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The event source⋯ The bounds of the world⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what is Dela Grante repeating over and over again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know, and it's not my duty to find out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow⋯ That was quite an unbelievable story.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* But you seem to understand it pretty well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I only sort of understand it. In other words, events are units that make up the world.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, that's not a wrong answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a question.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Go for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were talking about a model of Vrinda's Tree earlier.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, that's the basic concept of event science.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got that. Based on a certain cause, various results are produced.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There can be more than one result. It encompasses all possibilities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So here's my question.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shoot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happens if we trace back this Vrinda's Tree?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Trace back the tree⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if I'm understanding this right, the causes are producing results one after another.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, but what is the source of the cause?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The source of the cause⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's a place known as the event source.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The event source?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The event source⋯huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, so what do you mean when you talk about cause and effect?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's when the cause is determined by the result within the principle of causality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the cause is⋯led from the subsequent result?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the so-called never-ending cycle?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A pithy example. The cause A generates B, and B generates C, but C again generates A.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A → B → C → A → B⋯so on and so forth.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course, this is only a simplified model we're talking about. The details are quite complicated and its behavior is chaotic. However, when looking at the big picture, it's like a whirlpool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean history repeats itself over and over again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh yeah, you can say it almost repeats exactly the same pattern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand what you mean by almost⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It means that inertial force also influences causality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's not a difficult story. You get up every morning, brush your teeth, and go to school after eating breakfast. Can't you say that almost the same thing is repeated everyday?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sometimes I didn't eat breakfast.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, some local complications and different behavior can happen from time to time. But in the big picture, everyday you wake up and go to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. So, I guess the same thing happens here in Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In what exact way is history repeating itself?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know that either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But it's certainly in a dangerous situation now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That⋯whirlpool of cause and effect?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The tree structure of your world and the tree structure of Dela Grante may possibly come in contact.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My world and Dela Grante will come in contact?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. And it's not going to be a mere physical collision. It's an event collision.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An event collision⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A catastrophe. Both your world and Dela Grante will be annihilated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, the history that has been accumulating and repeating has been skillfully avoiding this⋯ That part is quite delicate and complicated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this? A compass magnet?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's an event meter. It senses the flow of the event element and points to that direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This little thing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Look at the needle⋯ It's slightly moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Under ordinary circumstances, the flow of the event element should be constant. In other words, the needle must face a certain direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, there's a disorder in the element flow.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's why it's showing the instability of this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, there is a history where every time a crisis occurs, it gets avoided.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. That repetition is being done⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long is that one cycle?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]One cycle of the history that's repeating over and over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can calculate it, can't you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can. It's approximately 8,000 years long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](8,000 years⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The interval of repeated history is 8,000 years⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, about that principle of causality⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]According to you, you've already experienced the existence of a parallel world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I did.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The parallel world is the process in which results are born from causes, one after another.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where worlds are created one-by-one?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. As long as the cause exists.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's difficult to imagine, but I want you to think of a tree structure. As if the roots were underground⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I can imagine.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In event science, we demand that you capture the concept of this tree. It is called Vrinda's Tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Vrinda's Tree⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. Let's focus on a certain part of that root.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]By giving a certain factor to the cause event, the result event is generated below it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean a world is generated?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a difficult way of saying it, but you can call it that. However, those who actually live there can only perceive it as a continuous world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The generated result event will become the cause of the event generated below it, and so on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, if a different factor is given to the cause event⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course, that can create a different result event.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I mean is, basically, you can't go back to the past and start over.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't get me wrong. An event is not about time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]For example, Takuya, there are events that exist where you thought about returning to the past.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Events diverge in various ways depending on what you do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]An event where you returned to the past⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯and an event where you did not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the fact that I went back in time, also gets included in this event?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. The history of going back in time is written on Vrinda's Tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Vrinda's Tree will silently generate events⋯ No matter what human beings happen to do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. Did you understand that going back in time is not synonymous with repeating history?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. So going back to the past might mean we aren't going back at all.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In my world, history is defined as what is described on Vrinda's Tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So could this world of Dela Grante also go back to the same place if we trace it back?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That could be true⋯ Everything in this universe is said to return to the same place if you trace back the event.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your world and my world?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And Dela Grante, too?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. However, I don't know how far and which level we need to retrace to arrive at the same place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Before coming to Dela Grante, I measured the event level in my world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can measure it? I thought Vrinda's Tree was just a concept, wasn't it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We can measure the flow of the event element and generate Vrinda's Tree of that world using CG.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't know you could do that. That's incredible.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's just an assumption. However, the measured and projected results are said to be highly credible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, did you see the tree structure of Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I saw a fairly simplified tree structure, but after a certain event level, an event repetition phenomenon occurred.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Event repetition⋯phenomenon?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Big picture, the same thing repeats over and over again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Literally, it is repeating history.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You told me earlier that it is impossible to repeat history.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I said it's impossible to go back in time and redo it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what does that mean? Does that mean that the same event happens again and again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. When the transmission rate of the causality and event viscosity exceeds a certain ratio, the flow of causality becomes unstable. This is the whirlpool of cause and effect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The whirlpool of cause and effect?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be⋯?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Causality is sort of a concept that flows from cause to result.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From cause to result⋯meaning, from past to future?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No. It is a system that encompasses time also.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is getting difficult.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, if you could easily understand this, you'd be a rather strange person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I take that as a challenge. I'm gonna get this.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Anyway, that's what causality is. Causality can also be understood like fluid flowing from upstream to downstream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Voltage also works like that, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, you're right. The electric currents move from high potential to low potential. Causality also works the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, where does it go again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The causality which moves from the cause to the result becomes the cause for anything below that, and is transmitted as if the fluid fragments move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, like the flow of a river.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. So we named the fluid fragment the 「event element.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The event element?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Have you heard about this before?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did. I remember seeing it in a paper written by Professor Imagawa.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯ It means that a paradigm is shifting in the world of science where you come from, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Back to the topic. The flow of causality means that the causality is transmitted across the river of event elements.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's hard to imagine. What's an event element anyway?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a thing that you cannot perceive with the science of your world. It's not an object.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, a concept then?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not a concept either. In event science, this element is defined as the antimatter of photon. A photon that runs in the imaginary space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck? So anything goes?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a fluid fragment flowing from high event potential to low event potential. We can apply extended fluid dynamics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry but⋯can we get back to the causality story?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This is certainly swaying me away from pursuing a career in teaching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There is a person named Schopenhauer in your world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know more than I do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He once said something like this⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]「Our worldview is formed by reshaping the impressions given by sentience from the outside into the form of time, space, and causality.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh. And?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sound like a typical student who's not interested.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because I don't understand what you're talking about![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What I'm trying to say is, you already know the laws that govern time and space. Beginning with Newtonian mechanics, quantum theory, and the theory of relativity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe just the outline of all of it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]These theories lack a critical factor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Other than time and space?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What more could there be?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you think it is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A woman![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Precisely. They lack the principle of causality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Causality⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Whoever quoted it probably understood it briefly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*cough* Science has its own critical weakness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People tend to become nerds?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, that's also one aspect, but⋯ Hey, don't point your finger at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In your country⋯ Throughout ancient Asian history, including Japan, there are concepts such as karma and reincarnation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I know the dictionary's definition of those terms, but not much more⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Those causalities could not be observed with a scientific eye, so it was not possible to capture them from the standpoint of natural science.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was the same in my world, too. But in your world, they have already perceived their causality from ancient times based on their own internal observation or intuition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that so?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ So what is causality?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Geez. I'm trying to give you the shortest explanation possible here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting kind of sleepy. I know! I have a suggestion for you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Rejected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I haven't even said anything yet.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When you suggest something with your eyes shining and happy like that, it must be sinister.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's discrimination![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Let's say it's an objective fact.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not a proper attitude for a teacher. Teachers should be able to observe their students fairly.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Trying to be a smart ass, huh? Well, let's hear what your suggestion is then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Every time you explain one thing, you take off a piece of clothing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? My level of concentration will increase.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not what you need to concentrate on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The word 「past」 is also misleading. We must first clarify the definition of the word⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, let's define the word 「past」 as the smaller value of the time axis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that what it's supposed to be already?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not quite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]For example, Takuya, let's say your morning did not start with a good bowel movement.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of example is that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Listen. The reason was because you ate a beef bowl last night. By the way, I like to put egg on top of my beef bowl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You are having stomach problems because of the food you ate last night. So, you went back to last night, and tried not to eat the beef bowl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So history's been changed. I can walk out of the bathroom the next morning with a smile on my face.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, history does not change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, I went to the past and started over, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, if there was only one time axis from the past to the future.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In event science, this is called axis uncertainty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please simplify it for me⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* There were a lot of students like you in my world, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You were a teacher in your world too?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I may not look it, but I have three doctoral degrees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow⋯ You can't judge a book by its cover.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, be nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko has⋯three PhDs?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks really flashy for a doctor⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya, what do you know about time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, exactly. Not in a physical sense, but as a concept.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's something irreversible, I guess?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Irreversible means that you cannot go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Which is incorrect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I'm not a straight A student.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Haha⋯ If you understood this, I'd call you a weirdo rather than a genius.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a compliment or what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Time is reversible. You can trace it back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's time patrol, just like I said.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, it's not. Time can go backwards, but it is impossible to follow the same path.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]For example. Let's say you went to the past and killed yourself. What's going to happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A time paradox occurs? Even I know that much about science.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well then, explain it to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, dear Ms. Teacher.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go to the past and kill myself, my existence itself will be gone on the spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because I will be gone at that point, a contradiction arises and the future me, who returned to the past, will no longer exist.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You almost got it right. I wouldn't necessarily say you got it wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. She sounds like a school teacher.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, the facts revealed through the science of my world say that time is reversible and no paradox shall occur.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In other words, when you return to the past, that is already not the past you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯ This theory⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've heard this before⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've come to your dimension following a certain criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A criminal⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, a terrible criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯ Are you something like a police officer?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A police officer⋯ No, not really. We're called the Dimension Inspection Bureau.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dim⋯what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Dimension Inspection Bureau. It is our duty to travel through space-time and punish anyone who comes in conflict with our laws.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, it's like time patrol, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Who came up with that silly name?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, well⋯because it's like you go through time and space.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, it's going to be difficult to explain things from here on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The time patrol you're talking about is probably the action of correcting the past and reflecting it in the future.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that what you do?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No. Conceptually, it's totally different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm an agent that travels through different dimensions. However, the dimensional faults result in temporal errors.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]As a result, I see the illusion as if I'm back in time, but it is conceptually quite different from what you are saying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't understand.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* I told you beforehand. It's hard to understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯ It's like I'm listening to the lectures at school.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Haha⋯ I can give you a discount on tuition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko works for the Dimension Inspection Bureau⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it was me back then, I might have laughed this whole thing off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But now, I can believe in anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First, I want to know who you really are.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A school physician at Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You tried to be smart but didn't get what you want, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't look so upset. Haha⋯ Even if I explained, you probably won't understand it. I'll keep it conceptual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've come from a completely different dimension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can believe you now. I was also in a different world before coming to Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh heh⋯ That's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, are you from Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, are you a resident of the world where⋯ Sakaimachi existed?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I came from another dimension, completely different from here or your world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A completely different dimension⋯ Then, what about your name, Eriko Takeda?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a pseudonym, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you mind telling me your real name? Just for reference.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]At the language level you are at, you won't be able to pronounce my name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well I did say just for reference.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Let's see, the closest pronunciation would be 「Aichlikkwadrou.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aichi⋯what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I told you⋯it's impossible for you to pronounce it. Just call me Eriko as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is⋯a human from another dimension.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can believe anything right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet house⋯ Looks like a two-bedroom home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is resting in the other room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A well-kept house. Small, but not bad.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You could say that. No one was around, so I came in and started living here without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She used to be a teacher⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯but I can't see that from this behavior.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you want to know me, then talk to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe I ran into Ms. Eriko in a place like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I always thought it was strange but⋯who is she really?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* Don't stare at a woman so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Seriously? Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When I see her, I don't know why⋯but I'm always like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, your chest is big and super jiggly![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all I've got to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amazing as ever.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Milk, it does a body good?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, it seems to be some function-oriented clothing rather than for the pleasure of the viewer.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I suppose that's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Also⋯ What are you wearing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm? This fitted suit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. It's a pleasant purple⋯ No, It's pretty outrageous.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This fabric is made out of special fiber. I won't even get a scratch from a knife and it's a functional suit that's extremely easy to move around in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or so she says⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That jacket of yours looks very solid.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I must tell you, this metal jacket is bulletproof, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]9mm bullets from your world will not even stick to this thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or so she says⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my line. What's that crazy dress?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This is my original uniform.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Are you going to leave Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now is not a good time.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I guess now isn't the best time.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There is a high possibility that the Royal Guards are searching nearby.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Are you willing to listen to my story?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmph.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmph.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, this thigh right here, it's quite nice.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yikes. You look scary, so I'll stop.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You always do something that doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to feel an iron fist.)[%p]
*boing*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just wanted to check how this functional suit feels.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see, then do you want to feel an iron fist, too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I touch her thigh, she might start preaching again⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll stop.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmmmm, the material of this suit is⋯ What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Seriously, you don't change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't start preaching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if I touch the desk, it's not fun at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, this desk feels pretty good.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What the heck are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have no complaints with me touching here, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not the issue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have no complaints with me touching here, do you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well⋯ What are you going to do, with your hand on the desk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's so fun about touching the desk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd rather touch your boobs or your thigh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not a chance.[%p]
