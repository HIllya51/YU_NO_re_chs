[name]Takuya[line](Smells like someone is cooking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she tied her hair up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She tied her hair up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it because she's cooking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her neck is so pale.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So attractive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The nape of Kanna's neck.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks sexy when she wears her hair up like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's frying something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's vegetable stir fry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something in the frying pan.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. This must be the source of the sizzling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The clunking sound must have been from the knife.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something so nice about a girl cooking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's true⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Last night, Kanna and I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't think like that with Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Watching her cook from behind, it's almost like⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]So you're awake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uhh, forget about it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm making breakfast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-Thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Just wait a few more minutes and it'll be ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is everything all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I just remembered something that I'd forgotten.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a very reminiscent feeling I got when I heard the sound of sizzling in my sleep.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remembered how much I like seeing a girl from behind. Would it be weird if I said you seemed like my mom?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]We didn't do anything last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa–huh? Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And thanks to that I barely got any sleep last night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, think about it. A cute girl was sleeping nearby wearing nothing but a t-shirt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But with Kanna, I don't really get horny.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, what could this feeling be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* All by myself on the floor⋯hm?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I sleeping on the bed?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I put you there this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You seemed cold sleeping on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. So we didn't do anything?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why do you ask? Am I so unattractive that you didn't want to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't ask me like that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have my reasons.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I said it's because you're too cute?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the kind of guy that tends to err on the side of caution when a feast is slapped down in front of me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I try to find the person who's on the other end of the fishing line, if you know what I mean.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you find anyone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Who was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are your plans today?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have to speak with Ms. Takeda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Other than that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Nothing in particular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you do every day?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got any hobbies?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about your favorite food?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Nothing that stands out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Favorite singer?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't listen to music.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what do you like?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Green.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Green?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Green as in red, blue, yellow, and green?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I mean plants. I enjoy looking at trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought you'd be more of an ocean girl.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Not at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But aren't you always looking at the ocean?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I hate the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's just⋯my duty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your duty?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you like plants.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's eat something and then go.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Go where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go see some green, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think I understand how I feel about Kanna at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I feel this way?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no need to panic.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I still have time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's still time⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A clear sky, cotton candy clouds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And a beautiful girl by my side.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is perfect for some exercise, especially after that nice breakfast you made.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want to sit?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Next to the fountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't like fountains?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I⋯ It's all right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it that bad sitting by the fountain?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, Kanna is close to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is in the kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is in the kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There is something so nice about a girl cooking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's somehow relaxing and comforting.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Kanna, isn't it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something fascinating about a girl wearing her apron in the kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An apron.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A must-have item when cooking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a kitchen cabinet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I open it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I doubt anything will be inside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such beautiful, pale legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those are Kanna's legs. She's barefoot, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her upper thighs catch my attention a lot more than her feet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Am I that desperate to get a peek at a girl's panties?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah I am.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How long am I gonna stare?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hahaha ah! Oh no⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A light purple, eh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is a nice sight to see first thing in the morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there even running water here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This apartment makes me question basic things like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The kitchen sink.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must be washing dishes and stuff here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kitchen ware, I guess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know what any of these are for.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a kitchen, so it's not strange to have a bunch of things on here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can smell something good.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the kitchen in Kanna's apartment.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like she's cooking something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is tied up in the back⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna's hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not too interested in that kind of stuff, to be honest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd like to give it a try some time though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would I hit her with that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, are you trying to kill Kanna or something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to use that right now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the right time to use that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what am I supposed to do with that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Try using your head a little.)[%p]
