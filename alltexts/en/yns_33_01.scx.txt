[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of the door to the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so interesting about the wall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of the study. Don't I have something to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall of the second-floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is my old man's study, so the name plate matches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「Father's Study.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who call themselves 「Father」? Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door to my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not locked now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty stupid to just stand around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of my father's study. I can't get in without a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where it is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is knocking gonna help?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to open it if I wanna go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock, knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saying it aloud won't help. No one's there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter now many times I knock, no one's going to be inside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're going inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're going inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm, switch. Where's the switch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same old study⋯ I remember getting in trouble for coming in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's as messy as always. Looks like Ayumi hasn't cleaned it up yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope⋯ It's locked and won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only I had the key to the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the living room for a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's unlocked now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if I use the key to the study, maybe it would open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It worked. It's open![%p]
