[name]Takuya[line]This is the hallway of the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My underclassman, Yuuki, is there. Let's talk to him.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hey chief?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said, stop calling me that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why did you quit the club?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You heard me. How about doing some studying for the upcoming entrance exams for once?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Didn't I tell you I wasn't taking entrance exams?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're not?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Nope. I chose this school because it brings you all the way through a college degree, just like an escalator. Nice and easy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I guess you had a change of heart then.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you think miss you-know-who is going to start losing patience?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't she waiting in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh yeah! This is bad, Miss Mio is going to be mad at me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey man, you can't already be so whipped this early in the relationship.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You seemed to be in a hurry too, Takuya. Is everything all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I mean, you came down from the rooftop all out of breath.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Did I? I'm not in any particular hurry.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I see. Anyway, I'm going to the school infirmary to meet her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was I that out of breath?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just looking for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I was pretty out of breath. Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't like pesky girls anyway. So don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's the strange thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, out with it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I think she's only pesky to you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's really nice and always smiling to me and the other students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't want to make you feel bad, but she just acts that way in front of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She hates me more than a cockroach, I bet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You think so? Well, how do I explain it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's like how you get extra angry at a dog that bites you when you're trying to be nice to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I'm someone's pet now?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]N-No. They say the cuter someone is, the easier they are to hate, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think whatever you want. Just don't get your imagination mixed up with the truth.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*sigh* Hey, it's just my thought, that's all⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a thought. Nothing more.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It could be that maybe, just maybe, she likes you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if she did?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look so glum. I know you have a thing for her. So don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, okay then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, you see how proud she is? Just think about it for a minute.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]G-Good point. I guess Miss Mio would never fall for someone like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, someone like me? Geez.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't look so angry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. Whatever. I'm totally out of her league. You should try to make something of it, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]M-Make something of it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He might be a little more innocent than I thought.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But the curse doesn't seem like just another rumor anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With all this happening, you might be right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thanks to all the commotion, I was able to ask her out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ask who out?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. You finally did it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. I asked her to go home with me because of all the commotion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*faint*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯it's just the way you have with words.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]However, she didn't seem very scared. It's hard to explain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet she was really interested, wasn't she?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, that's right. Miss Mio and I seem to connect about strange things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How did you know about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Know what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That Miss Mio likes mysterious things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ You know. Girls like her love gossip and scary stories and stuff.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plus, it's my job as the 「walking libido」 to understand all my classmates.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I see⋯ Good point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was kidding.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But she really is wonderful, isn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean Elizabeth Taylor?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Who's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know who she is? Her name represents beauty all over the world.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What year are you living in? I'm talking about Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you've been after Mio ever since club activities started.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't be ridiculous. I joined the club because I wanted to be as good as you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You certainly are good with words, I'll give you that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh, heh, heh. We get to go home together again today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go home together? With your mom?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why would I be talking about my mom? I'm talking about Miss Mio, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wipe that smile off your face.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I can't help it. I'm just so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The whole reason we can go home together is because of that incident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What incident?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The curse. It was the talk of the town for a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that. The one about the slit-mouthed woman?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, that's so old. Well, I guess it's not much different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There were even some people that died, right? They haven't caught it yet, have they?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Doesn't seem like it. They say it was some kind of wild cat, so it probably ran off somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I figured it was some pervert walking around in a weird outfit.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That would be pretty funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it were me, I'd chase after people screaming about some cursed turtle.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You didn't do it, did you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, that's ridiculous, no matter how perverted you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]H-Hey, don't stare at me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm glad you're such an idiot.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't think you should say that to anyone else though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]About it being a curse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Everyone thinks it's you that did it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*faint*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh, so that's why all the girls are looking at me differently.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That makes me a little⋯sad.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I need to go to the school infirmary later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are classes over?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, it ended with no casualties.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good work.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You seem to be in a good mood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I watched you come skipping down the stairwell, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was I being that giddy?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, yeah. You looked like a carriage horse running for his mare.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Yuuki[line]H-Hey, it was just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You never sound like you're joking, you know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Anyway, were you skipping class again on the rooftop, Boss?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just taking a nap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's the same as skipping⋯whoa whoa whoa, napping, okay I get it! Don't look so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wasn't just any nap though. It was to restore my courage. Don't they say sleepiness is man's worst enemy?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Who says that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, that's why I call you Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You keep calling me weirder and weirder names.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are you coming back tomorrow, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I have a special deal worked out, so I have remedial classes again tomorrow. Muahaha![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]If you sleep in, you'll fail your class. You'll end up repeating a whole year, which is no joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I request a morning wake-up call then?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aye aye, captain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the heck are you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll give you a call first thing in the morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be pissed off if you call me too early. I'm not a morning person.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I know that.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Yuuki, who are you with there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, if it isn't the academy idol, Miss Mio Shimazu.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Academy idol? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, the walking libido, Arima. Long time no see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rawr, I'm the walking libido![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why do I have to be put in such an uncomfortable situation the day before summer vacation starts?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's that time of the month.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're disgusting.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Takuya, could you maybe take it easy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you so afraid of, Yuuki? It's not like we're doing something illegal.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]W-Well, no, we're not.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki, just ignore him.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, okay then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't let her tell you what to do.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, okay then⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did he faint? Now, my fair lady.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't seem to be in a great mood. How disappointing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Seeing your face put my hopes in the dump.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, my little Mio, you're always so nice.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have no right to talk so cute to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay Mio, jump into my arms.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't call me by my first name, people might get the wrong idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then shall I call you Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I feel dumb just talking to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I win![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What were you doing on the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Changing the subject, are we? What about the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It looked like you were talking to Ms. Takeda about something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just some career counseling, that's all. What, were you spying on us?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I saw her come down, then you. It's not that hard to put two and two together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My hat's off to such incredible deduction.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You still love older women, don't you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They're making you take remedial classes, aren't they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that. If I fail this one, I'll be in big trouble.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you actually studying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I study for remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You idiot. There's a final exam at the end of class. If you don't pass that, you fail the class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. So there's an exam, huh. That's not good.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not good? *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you look so frustrated?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you want to think of a way to avoid being in a 「not good」 situation?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way a straight-A student like you would think, not me. That's how I got to where I am today, hahaha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's nothing to brag about, you idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm an idiot, then your momma's fat![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't glare at me like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, at this rate you'll either be held back a year or have to quit school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the big deal about that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Whatever. Just make sure you attend your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'll have no chance of passing the final exam⋯ Hey, why're you acting so weird?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you telling me this? You're not a teacher.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just don't want to leave behind one of my classmates. It's a matter of pride.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. You take things very seriously.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I need to go to the school infirmary and talk to Ms. Takeda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what are you going to talk to her about?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I'll come pick you up later, Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, please do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, how long are you gonna stay on the ground?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll get up if you could please remove your foot from my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The way you two always talk to each other really surprises me, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does it? It's pretty normal to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Every time I see it, I feel like I've lost 100 days off my life. It's like watching The Twilight Zone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man, that's an old reference.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I just know when you have that look, you're ready to reprimand me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* What was with that anyway?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said you'd go pick her up later and she's all 「yes, please do.」[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]W-Was there something wrong with my grammar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you moron. Don't you have any pride as a man?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But if I don't say that, she'll get mad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't massage your temples like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, it's not like this is the start of him being pussy-whipped⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because the last classes before summer vacation ended.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps all the students flew out of the building like bullets?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Everyone left while you were sleeping on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, you're very critical of me lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because classes are over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barely any students around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Yuuki, my club junior.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I helped him once when a bunch of thugs were picking on him. He's been on me like white on rice ever since.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really like wusses like him, but he seems to love me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There were five of them, with bodies like pro wrestlers, and Takuya took them all out with a single wooden sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't start narrating here.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Gotcha. You're really tough though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Such a push over. I'll make you hard some day.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I want to be as hard as you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not just hard. I'm long and thick, too.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter what he says, he seems to like me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess he's a good guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hoodie. Like the one Yuuki is wearing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school allows students to wear uniforms and normal clothes too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki chooses to wear his own clothes, just like everyone else. The girls mostly seem to wear uniforms for some weird reason⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't complain; it makes someone with a schoolgirl fetish like me pretty happy.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't mention that in front of Miss Mio. She'll beat you bloody if she hears you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I'll definitely tell her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hoodie. Not a booty.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are you going to go take another nap?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, I just came down.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Get your act together. Are you still half asleep?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯my feet are moving toward the stairs![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop me already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I won't go up to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki's embarrassed for me.[%p]
