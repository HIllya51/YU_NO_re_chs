[name]Takuya[line]I hope Celes will like it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Birds are singing far in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes everything seem so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet here. It feels so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A house made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Instead of looking around the house, why don't we try something else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just a house sitting in a wide open field. A knight named Illia used to live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, me and two others live in that house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is quite difficult to pile up these stones, though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the surface of the stone, it seems like there are thin layers of moss⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A plant that emits smoke when you touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a cactus with a bonbon on it. What a strange plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I probably shouldn't touch it. It'll spit out smoke if I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, we just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're gonna go inside, just open the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I live here. No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. Let's try doing something less silly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're in now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I'm around, that plant is going to keep growing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, just once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough* See? It spat out that smoke![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably using the smoke to reproduce. *cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Touching this will make it spit out smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't.[%p]
