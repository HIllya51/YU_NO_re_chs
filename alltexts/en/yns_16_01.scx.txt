[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's very creepy at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to meet that woman Kaori and ask her some questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Ryuuzouji's mansion entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somehow, I'm drawn to it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because this place is haunted?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko was playing catch here last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you believe that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already talked to Ryuuzouji for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go home soon, or Ayumi will worry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We talked for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go home now, so Ayumi won't worry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived at the front of the samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just like Mitsuki said: Ryuuzouji is kinda strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived at the front of the samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it's really scary at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've passed by here several times. This mansion is incredible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big pine tree in front, and the house is huge. Does the principal really make that kind of money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place has lot of trees, but it's amazingly well maintained.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it gets a lot of bugs in the summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko was on the roof last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stone is tiled. It is attached to a concrete wall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did they actually build this with stone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see. It's just stone veneer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I nervous about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stairs. The mansion is higher than the road.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Someone is coming down the stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she live here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's an older woman with a traditional look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does she live here?)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]May I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you live here?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an amazing house, very striking.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Tehehee! You're too kind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]The young man knows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Young⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I am, compared to her.)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]There is a word⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]How can a sparrow soar with the eagles?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]This house was built about 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Take a moment and think about how old that really is⋯400 years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was built about 400 years ago. It's a historic building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that question about the sparrow mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard that proverb somewhere before⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna climb up there⋯ I don't want to get worn out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this made out of stone? This is an incredible house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was Ms. Eriko doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope leading to the front gate of Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko was playing catch here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a road that will take you straight up to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope leading to the front gate of Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our school is located at the top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of pine trees planted around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm surprised to see trees planted here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow! It's been very carefully cut, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the mansion where Ryuuzouji lives.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the samurai mansion everyone gossips about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki said there's a rumor this place is cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Practically anything could exist in a mansion this big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a full moon tonight. What perfect timing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will look even better under the bright moonlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky perfectly complements the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is different, depending on the environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's even creepier around here at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing here in front of this huge mansion is overwhelming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really creepy around here at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, I'm curious about what that old lady said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told me to check the storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just walk into someone's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go in now, I'll probably run into Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll ring the bell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's odd. There's no bell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. Do I really have to knock on this huge gate?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a really long way from the gate to the main building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's squeaking terribly. Was it like this last night, too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can go inside. I guess I should.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm praying I don't run into that old lady.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't go in without permission. Besides, there's no point trying right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. The gate's closed, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she won't let me in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, where is Mitsuki? If she's not here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is Ryuuzouji's secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's inside.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]May I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhh![%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Can I help you? Oh, you're that young man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have a name, you know⋯)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]May I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Mitsuki–I mean, is Ms. Ichijou here?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ichijou? I don't know that woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't live here. She's just Ryuuzouji's secretary.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Oh, I see. What's a secretary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]I'm sorry, my hearing is terrible. There is no one in my house right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where could Mitsuki be?)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Who is this Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* She is always with Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]A woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, that's right.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]A woman? Is someone with my son?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ah, yes. He's changed a lot since that woman showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Changed? What woman?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Yes⋯ She's a scary woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay, lady?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Scary woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A woman? Is someone with my son?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Mitsuki is with Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't understand what's so disturbing about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I can't just walk in! Besides, what's the point?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji was my father's best friend, but I don't think I can just walk into his house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It means I can't go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If that's how it is, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I came here because I got a call.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can go back to the school after I talk with Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came here for nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I wanted to go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's late. I have to go back now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, maybe I should go back to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the mansion's wall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I stay here a while, I don't think I can get into Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know why, but I feel like I should wait around here a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look around a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there. Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said no. I should take a look at the tile on the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See? Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See? At the top of the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If that's how it is, there's nothing I can do from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should get closer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, this isn't the best time to use things.[%p]
