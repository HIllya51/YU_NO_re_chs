[name]Takuya[line]That's a lot of noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get caught like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to move fast![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it's not that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to hide![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing? I'll get caught if I stay here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to hurry. I can't move too slowly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So there's no need to push it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should have used the card first and then pushed the button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The order is very important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can get inside with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pushing it doesn't seem to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pushing doesn't work. What about pulling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like I can't pull it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has the same device on this side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a place to push.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course nothing happens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are buttons lining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it'll open if I push one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to use this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small blue light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small blue light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this without a card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to use a Jewel or use 「Keep Map and Items as is」 and get a card somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a thin opening like a slit. It's the card reader.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I actually don't have a card to insert here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the [Magnetic Card]. This is what I need now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go find it somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to push it. More importantly⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a very thin opening, like a slit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's probably where you insert the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to put the card in now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at this is making my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect brightness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a commotion in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can tell how frantic they are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The red light hurts my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bright red light against the gray wall makes it stand out even more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This really feels like an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It doesn't look like there's anywhere to hide here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This feels like an emergency bunker, but it's better than no shelter at all.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Section D12 is this way. The laboratory![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Stay on guard! Call for backup![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh. I've got company. I should hurry inside.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ouch⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, Takuya. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh, today's my lucky day. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Section D12 is this way! Hurry![%p]
[name]Voice[line]You check inside the lab. You check the other rooms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Whoops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! That was close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man, today's not my day.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, d-did that scare you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd ask, but I'm scared too. I didn't think things would turn out this way.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]They should still be close! Find them![%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'll look here. You look over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Chief Arima. I'm sure you're busy, but there's been an emergency alert inside the building. I'd appreciate your cooperation.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Under the desk![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks![%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'm sorry to bother you. A thief has broken in.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wow, that's frightening.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Unfortunately, some papers were stolen from the lab.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'm very sorry. I never thought we'd have break-ins two nights in a row. I promise we'll find the thief and get the papers back.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm counting on you.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Call for a guard right away if you see anything suspicious.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you. I'm fine here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew. I made it out somehow.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come out. It's okay now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It seems some papers were stolen from the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-So it seems. Hahaha, people do terrible things.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ Do you have something to tell me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯ What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is closed, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Ayumi's office. The door is closed now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just came out of there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get it together.[%p]
