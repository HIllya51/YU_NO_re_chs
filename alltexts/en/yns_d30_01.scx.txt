[name]Takuya[line]Where am I⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, let's just keep going for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could possibly be over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A well?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I've been worrying about that as well, however⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this really the mansion's garden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it was built by piling up stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First, I have to figure out the current situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't think I'd see this in the middle of the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Makes me want to come catch some giant beetles around dawn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is more of a forest than a copse of trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a tree trunk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many trees here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yet there aren't any birds chirping⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like the forest is gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like another world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought this was merely a spooky mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this is just like⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass growing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The grass looks like a fluffy bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it would feel good to lie down under a tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hang on, now's not the time to think like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This scene looks more like a natural garden than a bunch of weeds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is crystal clear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bright rays of the sun are coming through the leaves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, aren't you curious?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There, right in front of me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. It's not the time to use that.)[%p]
