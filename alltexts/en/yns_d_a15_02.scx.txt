[name]Takuya[line]It's a dim, small room, surrounded on all sides by rock walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sword?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would something like that be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's made of iron.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems really strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯maybe I can use this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Iron Sword][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Iron Sword][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing out of the ordinary here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air feels so heavy here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls, the ceiling⋯ It's all stone, through and through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's the air coming from, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not stuffy in here at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made of pretty sturdy stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are pebbles on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't really anything on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing but pebbles⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure why, but there are seams in this wall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This one wall seems different from the others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't slide side to side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
Gah⋯ Grrr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. No good. Pushing won't even make it budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe instead of pushing it, I can pull⋯ Oh, there's nothing for me to hold on to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see a dividing line here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This wall is different from the rest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I go this way, that stone door will still be blocking my way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't I check out the open door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]The door closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it'll open if I push the button again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't I have something I need to be doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]The door opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Each time I press the button, the door opens or closes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a small button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯ The door on the right closed![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What am I going to do? I'm locked in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]C-Calm down⋯ Calm down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the door closed when I pushed the button⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then maybe if I press it again, it'll open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Forget the button. I should focus on moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It opened![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? It looks like if the right door isn't closed, the left door won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why does it have to be so complicated?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe there's some reason they can't be opened at the same time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, something strange is going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earlier⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When that damned door closed, that hole opened up behind us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like every time we move forward, our path back is blocked off⋯somehow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well either way, the door is open. Looks like I can move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a small button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange⋯ Nothing's happening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I shouldn't press the button over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. There's no turning back now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should move on ahead⋯carefully.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I can't go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I tried going back, that stone door would be blocking me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just head out for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the entrance I just came in through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I'm going back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Mitsuki should still be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like now isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
