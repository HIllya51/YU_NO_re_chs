[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ She's finally gone to bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Finally, it's tomorrow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody knows what's gonna happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will Dela Grante really be destroyed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet. It's very quiet here today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's water flowing from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that's just today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is sleeping right over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to think right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the right time to move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You don't look so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Heh. I thought you might be feeling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're a pretty decent guy for not being pissed at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the energy to be pissed.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Do you need a little comforting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kind words like that don't suit you at all.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ah, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I expect to hear things like that from someone more nurturing than you.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I guess you being nice that night was just a fluke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I'm just a little nervous.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I know. Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The God-Monarch⋯ That woman is your mother, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's my stepmother from my world.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She's taken too much on herself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The responsibility of being God-Monarch is too much. What's she gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Will we be saved?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I still don't completely believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She's a good kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She has the future of the world resting on her shoulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks that way.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I still can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't believe it either. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see you're feeling better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not usually one to just sit and think. If thinking could save us, I'd gladly do it all day.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just hate the word destiny. Most people use that word to excuse their own failings.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's actually about possibilities, about perspective. If you expect things to be bad, they'll always be bad.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But if you really think about it, there's actually a chance for things to go well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If Yu-No does the ritual, moves this world without any physical or metaphysical collision, and somehow remains in perfect health⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just think that's impossible.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's possible. How can she be expected to succeed if her own father doesn't believe in her, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I know, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just as you say, Amanda.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry I'm forcing my dumb worries on you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were just trying to cheer me up.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No I wasn't. I just couldn't stand watching you mope around any more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I that pathetic?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're looking pretty good now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What happened?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you there![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Look over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Huh? The castle's in chaos![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's right.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, you over there![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]You're guests of the God-Monarch? What business do you have here?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]He's quite a bit colder than last time.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing, ignore her. Everything is so chaotic right now.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]He means that we can't find the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You⋯ You can't find her?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Tomorrow is the day of the ceremony. We have a serious problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did Ayumi go somewhere?)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]This has never happened before. Last we heard, she was with a strange man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A man?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Yes. A large man, wearing gaudy clothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A large man⋯[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]He was reported as an austere man with a beard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An austere man with a beard⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji?![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is bad. We need to find her right away.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Yes. We'll do everything we can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good. Now quit screwing around here and get searching![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Yes, sir![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji. This is bad.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why are you so pale? What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda, we have to find Ayumi immediately.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's wrong? Is it that bearded man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't explain now, but he's an inter-dimensional criminal. Ayumi is in danger.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's going on? Everyone's so upset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi may have been taken.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's split up and look for her. Ryuuzouji is very dangerous.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do we do? Without her, I have no idea what to do for the ceremony.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Doesn't that mean both this world and your world will be destroyed, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say things like that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going, too, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll search around the altar![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Okay, I'll search the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What kind of guy is Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's tall. Yeah, he's a head taller than me. He has a beard, and he's usually smoking a cigar. Wait, no cigar.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's a big guy with a beard.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Got it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe this happened the night before such an important day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't do the ceremony at all without Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means exactly what you said, Amanda. Both this world and my world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't think about that now. We need to look for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone's gone out to search. But what can I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't I do anything for her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No said she would perform the ceremony, but I know she's afraid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm so useless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is standing by and watching her die really all I can do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Dela Grante⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. I don't wanna think about it.[%p]
