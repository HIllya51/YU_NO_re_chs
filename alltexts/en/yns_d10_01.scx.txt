[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean is a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come up here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean is a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need a speaker right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Monaural, hmm⋯ Now that I think about it, I bet monorail is short for monaural rail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trains are separated into east- and west-bound, but they don't call them stereorails.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems inconsistent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the speaker for school announcements.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to get out of breath.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That harsh smell reminds me of paint or varnish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bad kids used to put this in plastic bags and huff it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school. What is there to stare at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go through here, I can go down to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm glad you've indulged me so many times, but I don't want to sit anymore.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Making noise when I sit down makes me sound like an old geezer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to look at boring pictures.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some old Renaissance art depicting poverty and corruption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm lying, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub. It has nothing to do with that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's totally different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty rare to see shrubs on a rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Educators just seem to want to plant things. Do they feel guilty about nature or something?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's there so students don't fall.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I don't know why this lamp's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been wondering if they turn off the electricity at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaand it turned on. Of course. What a waste of power.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure the lamp turns on at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one comes here at night. I wonder why it's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark, so I can't really see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]During midday yesterday and then last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There have been continuous lightning strikes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess there was an accident, but there's no smoke anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so dark and cold that I feel I could disappear into the night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could punch right through the sky.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the sky makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The clouds are all puffy like cotton candy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in spacing out here, is there?[%p]
