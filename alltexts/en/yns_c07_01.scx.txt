[name]Takuya[line]The corridor. That woman named Kaori isn't here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came to the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor is dark. Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. Classes are already over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's the case, where should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor. I wonder if they're still holding remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm skipping class, so I should do my best not to get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're probably in the middle of remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. Where's Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sitting in the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof, I'm getting old![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bench; a place to take a load off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do old men always make so much noise when they sit down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I feel like that's a deep question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I think this is mostly for Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what I really don't understand is why there's so many cigarette butts in the ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I thought smoking was banned on campus grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, they never explained what the penalty was for smoking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this point there's only some kind of academic penalty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ashtray for the ashes of chain-smoked cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why is there an ashtray in the middle of a school hallway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stairs to go directly down to the school gate are through the emergency exit on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I follow these directions⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I run into the glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know: it's the sign that indicates emergency exits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never used this thing before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I guess not having to use it is a good thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hose wrapped up inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light's on. What a waste of electricity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This light's on even during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They should think of something a little more eco-friendly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light. It's on even during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so bright out. Is it really necessary for the light to be on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I think this is mostly for Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what I really don't understand is why there's so many cigarette butts in the ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I thought smoking was banned on campus grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, they never explained what the penalty was for smoking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this point there's only some kind of academic penalty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ashtray for the ashes of chain-smoked cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why is there an ashtray in the middle of a school hallway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Down leads to the main hall, up goes to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're convenient stairs that let you go up or down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing too special, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a sticker indicating the emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you're inside, this is an exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you look at it from the outside, it'd be an entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The emergency exit sticker is stuck right on the window glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is obviously an emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A familiar indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're all over the place, just like convenience stores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pitch black outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somebody must be cleaning this every day. The window is always nice and clean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is nice and wide.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this much light being let in, it sure gets bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A handrail. I can't take it home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The handrail is here so you don't go flying off of the stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, I've never held this handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night. The hallway is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. There's no one here but club members and people attending remedial classes, so it's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get outside through this emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can swing right down to the front gate. Okay, I'll give it a try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's a shortcut to the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you think we came inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get outside through this emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can swing right down to the front gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll take this shortcut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, if I twist this, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha ha ha. I shouldn't have worried. Anyway, I can get outside now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get outside from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll take this shortcut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they closed it because it gets used so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, looks like I can't get outside this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get outside through this emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can swing right down to the front gate. Okay, I'll give it a try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up to the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, he said Ayumi went up to the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why she went up there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, to the roof it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Go to the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi went to the rooftop for an inspection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi on the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll go down to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory. Is someone there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pointless to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, there is a good chance that the teacher in charge could be a history teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Come in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman's voice. Who could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's closed. Which means no one's in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are there anywhere else I haven't visited?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I saw Ayumi in there yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she'll be there today, too.[%p]
