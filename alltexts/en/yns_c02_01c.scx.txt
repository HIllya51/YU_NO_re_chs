[name]Takuya[line]It's ringing so loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this on purpose?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to pick up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, on the counter. The receiver.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really not the time to be looking at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, fine. I'm getting it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello, this is Arima.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Well, if it isn't the clown boy still living at his parents' place.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you must be the porn director.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((I'm the construction director, Toyotomi.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi. I can't believe he would call the house.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have a few questions for this guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a few questions for the porn director.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((I'm pretty busy, so I don't have time to be speaking with the chief's dependents.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Anyway, is the chief there?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She is, but she's got a heavy load at the moment.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((What, a heavy load of laundry?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you, an idiot?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Anyway, it's an urgent matter. Go get her right now.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy really pisses me off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before that, there's something I want to ask you.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Oh really? And just what is that?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night, at the park⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Ayumi wearing?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((What? What's wrong?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up, you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-Who's there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is really nearsighted without her glasses.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She can't even tell it's me from this distance.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Aww⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aww what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You look so similar, I thought⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thought what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wasn't the phone just ringing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, this?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yes. That construction director said he had some urgent business and⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Who, Toyotomi? Is he on the phone right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wah! No way! I'm not ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. It's not like he can see you dressed like that through the phone.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((She's dressed like what?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up, you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dressed like⋯wah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A little late to notice⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll pick it up in my room, so put it on hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure⋯ I will.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ohh⋯ I bet he heard me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi went back into her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that was some nice view⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, what am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that scumbag Toyotomi want with Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has to do with work, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that security guard said there's some kind of problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Sorry to keep you waiting. This is Arima speaking.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Hello, chief.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Good morning.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see⋯ The phones are connected, so I can hear their conversation through the cordless phone.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Thank you so much for taking care of me last night.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Oh, no problem at all. I'd go through hell and high water for you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gag* Hell and high water?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Thank you for always giving me support. It helps a lot.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((It's my job to support you. Anyway, was your son all right?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((He's okay.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Those gangsters really knocked him down. I'm worried about him.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grr.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, he's fine. Sorry to make you worry.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Actually, a problem has come up⋯))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes⋯ Yes⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she talking with a guy like that?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((What, the document is already⋯?))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Yes. You know about the thief that broke in last night, right?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((No, this is the first I'm hearing of it.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((I see. Well, to make matters worse the auditors came in today.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((The audit revealed that the document was missing⋯))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I-Is that so⋯?))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Due to all of these problems hitting us at once, the board is calling for an immediate executive meeting today.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Today?!))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((There's no doubt in my mind the two things they'll be discussing are the lightning strike and the lost document.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I⋯see⋯))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Forgive me for not being able to protect you regarding the loss of the document.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((No, it's my fault⋯))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((It would have been a lot worse if all of the research had been stolen.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((All of the documents were together though, right?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Oh, about that⋯))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((What? Are you seriously going to tell me the most important page was separated?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes⋯ I can't discuss the details over the phone, so let's talk about it at the office.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Of course. I'll be waiting for you in your office.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Okay⋯ See you there.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lost document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be related to what happened last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to meet with that Toyotomi and get the truth out of him.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I have urgent business to attend to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the office?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, there's been a problem, it seems. So I have to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right. But⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be careful around Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Be careful around him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just make sure he doesn't try anything.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, you're so silly. Toyotomi is a nice guy. He's very considerate of me, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't worry about him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But something bothers me⋯ It just does.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, I shouldn't have let Ayumi go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A single page missing from a very important document⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The receiver is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to pick up the phone.[%p]
