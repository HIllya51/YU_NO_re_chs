[name]Takuya[line]Celes seems angry⋯ Anyway, I still have to pack my stuff up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to get prepared to go into the desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can get ready in the bedroom.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The air is so tense all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I probably should have snuck out while she was sleeping.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks very uneasy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Uneasy and sad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a little pretentious for me to think that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But to be honest, I'm not exactly all for going into the desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](First I need to get ready.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just go to the bedroom for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, if I'm going into the desert I'll need to prepare thoroughly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah. I should go into the bedroom to get things ready.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Talking to Celes won't help me much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyways, I should get ready.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I doubt Celes and I will agree about this.)[%p]
