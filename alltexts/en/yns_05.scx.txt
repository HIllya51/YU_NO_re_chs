[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
*glance*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't Mitsuki be here already?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she was calling from Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not far at all to get from there to here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school gate at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, look at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just wasting time here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can I meet that Kaori woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I need to do right now is talk to that woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman named Kaori that was with Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where can I go to see her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet. I only see students every now and again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Mitsuki anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where would she even go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I haven't seen Mitsuki at school yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I wandering around like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I go home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ms. Eriko, I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eek?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, Arima⋯and Ms. Takeda.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hello Miss Mio. This isn't the time for girls to be out walking around. What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk, she's one to talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh right, Ms. Eriko doesn't really qualify as a girl anyway.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Age has nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You look like you came from the coastline.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline⋯ So you were at Triangle Mountain, again?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has nothing to do with you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, well it's already late. You should go home, Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, you should walk her home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course you. It's not safe for a girl to walk alone this late at night⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's fine. I can get home by myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*grin* Ah, youth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, the Heights is a shady place, but her house is close by. She should be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You should hurry home too. Don't make your stepmother worry too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, that teacher⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she was doing there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's a little cold, but maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's mansion is back there to the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate at night. I'm starting to feel a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I can't go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school feels cold and dark at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one around.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! M-Mio?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me? It's rude to gawk at people like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's the matter with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's just⋯ Why are you still hanging around here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's none of your business. What took you so long?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, Mitsuki and I⋯ I mean, umm, you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ I took a nap on the roof and overslept. Yeah, that's it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmmph, that sounds plausible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does that mean?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? That could only be⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*pant⋯pant* Huh? Takuya⋯*pant* I⋯ And⋯*pant⋯pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Catch your breath before you talk.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*gasp* Haaah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm standing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ahhahaha, good joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't look so angry please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Come on Yuuki, let's go.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whatever you say, Miss Mio![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio told me to wait, so I had to wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, that's very loyal of you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the princess is calling you. Better get going.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, I'll be right there! I'm off then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like he left. I guess I should leave, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I saw that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't scare me like that. God, that just took a year off my life.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aah⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll call you later. Thanks for today. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Today is taking years off my life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, I guess I should go home, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! M-Mio?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me? It's rude to gawk at people like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's the matter with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ Are you still studying this late at school?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No. What are you still doing at school, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, Mitsuki and I⋯ I mean, umm, you know⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ I took a nap on the roof and overslept. Yeah, that's it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmm. That sounds plausible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's that supposed to mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, why are you in casual clothes, Mio? I thought you always wear your uniform during the day.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you actually think I would change on the side of the road?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you imagining?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're saying you left school, went home, changed your clothes, and came back?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're half right. I'm coming back from somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somewhere?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Miss Mio![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? This voice is⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*pant⋯pant* Huh? Takuya⋯*pant* I⋯ And⋯*pant⋯pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Catch your breath before you speak.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*gasp* Haaah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm standing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ahahaha, good joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't look so angry please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hmm, I see.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What? What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing. So you two are heading home?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heheheh, yes. I just couldn't let a woman walk alone at night with all the curses and spells around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where were you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, Triangle Mountain and⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yeah?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're walking me home, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Of course![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Thank you, Yuuki. You are so dependable.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really!? I've never been happier to be me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]After stopping by Miss Mio's house, we went to the foot of Triangle Mountain and⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I-I apologize.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That has nothing to do with Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah. That's true.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's go, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, I'm with you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry. I wasn't there for roll call during third period and couldn't respond for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it. You were with the princess, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, how did you know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could I not know? You're such a dumbass.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the princess is calling you. See ya.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, I'll be right there! I'm off then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like he left. I guess I should, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I saw that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't scare me like that. God, that just took a year off my life.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aah⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll call you later. Thanks for today. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Today is taking years off my life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, I guess I should go home, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school feels cold and dark at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already evening. I feel like time is flying by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which reminds me, I feel like I had plans in the evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school gate. Students come out of it sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a quiet place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear the school bell ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe the remedial classes are over.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling someone's coming up behind me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean a bad feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're looking pretty good today. How are your studies going?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You didn't go to a single one of your remedial classes, did you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My double did.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't believe you're forcing Yuuki to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, that's weird. He said he was happy to go to class instead of me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph, just because you talked him into doing it. I feel bad for Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you so worried about Yuuki, huh? Do you like him?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here anyway, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I uh⋯ My third period class is the same class I had during the school year, so I opted out of the lecture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial classes are all the same as classes during the school year. You knew that when you signed up, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sh-Shut up. Hmmph, Ms. Ichijou looked lonely![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Ichijou? Why is she bringing up Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she still mad about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they're still holding remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]My-My, I keep seeing you today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've been relatively busy myself. I find that I'm in and out of the school quite a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Also, I live nearby, so I get called back right away when something happens. Keeps me busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Why are you staring at me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd like to ask you one thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't happen to go to the shrine last night, did you?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was at home all night. I'm actually afraid of the curse, so I rarely go out at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curse?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, you don't know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've sorta heard of it⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Two people have already died. Can't be too careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You asked if I went to the shrine. Why? Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all I wanted to know. I have to go to my remedial class now.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. Well, study hard. I'm sure Koudai is counting on you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Takuyaaa![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Nothing is with me. I've been attending the third year classes, but I don't understand a thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why have you been attending third year classes?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why⋯ You're the one that asked me to go as your double, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Keep up the good work.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Nothing is with me. I've been attending third year remedial classes for you, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How considerate of you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ahem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, was Mio taking remedial classes, too?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. Don't expect any thank-you cards from me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Nothing is with me. I've been attending the third year classes, but I don't understand a thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why have you been attending third year classes?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why⋯ You're the one that asked me to go as your double, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Keep up the good work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. Students pass by occasionally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. Students pass by occasionally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what am I doing wandering around here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place she would go now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It looks like Ayumi isn't in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school gate. Isn't Ayumi inside the school?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯sorry, I wasn't looking and⋯
Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯sorry, I wasn't looking and⋯ Huh?
[name]Kanna[line]No, it was my fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My first name's Takuya. Feel free to call me that, and I'll call you Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess she doesn't get it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she at school?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she has remedial classes like I do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯*pant⋯pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going back and forth between here and the house⋯ What am I even doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's that over there?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji?!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're Koudai's son. Takuya Arima, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯ What's up with this guy?!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm relieved. It looks like you're attending your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You are⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, what is it? You don't look so well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy playing dumb?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If he is, I won't fall for it.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Koudai was my dear friend, and your stepmother Ayumi was a former student of mine. Tell me if you ever need any help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! What about⋯last night?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Last night? Oh, is this about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes! Where is she?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She does seem to be terribly busy. She completely stood me up last night. Hahahah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this guy saying?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's right, I received all of Koudai's research papers this morning. We don't want to let his work go to waste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's why the study looked like an empty shell.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. We've removed all of your father's research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I thought Ayumi told you about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on? I don't understand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, I must be going, but I must say, you seem a little off today. Maybe you should go home and rest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait. I still want to ask you something.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Pardon me. I wasn't looking and⋯
Oh, it's you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Pardon me. I wasn't looking and⋯ Oh, it's you.
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, I'm impressed. So you're actually here for your remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not exactly.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You need to take your classes. If not, your GPA will be in trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was like she was following Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is going on?[%p]
