[name]Takuya[line](Who is this woman? What is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with a very slight grin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so modern.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is cute, but I think she might be older than me.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't ask too much. I just want you to tell me one thing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just who are you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wait, you don't know who I am? Seriously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I lie about that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Right. That's too bad⋯ I guess I'm not as famous as I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does that mean?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm Kaori. Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kaori Asakura⋯ I feel like I've heard that name somewhere before.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you think you might have at least heard my name before?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, vaguely.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What about you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your name. What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm Takuya⋯ Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you were at the briefing then you've probably heard my name. I'm related to the person in charge of the construction site.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Chief Arima's⋯husband?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯of course not! I'm her son![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmph, her son, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could you even think Ayumi and I were married?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you have your panties in a bunch for? I was only joking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like she's in command of the space here.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, dear. It's almost nine o'clock. I'll be late for my date.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's just about nine, so that's perfect. You might be able to see me again if you hurry home and turn on the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, do you mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can meet her again if I turn on the TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori Asakura⋯ I've heard that name before somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's right where Toyotomi was standing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ATM card? Wait, no it's not⋯ There's no bank name on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be? I guess I'll hold on to it for now.[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Magnetic Card][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Magnetic Card][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]I remember Ayumi said something about going to a TV studio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go back to the Heights for now. No use standing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just who are you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, doesn't it fire you up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It seems like we're all alone here, if someone were to see us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But as we stand here, someone is always watching. Isn't that what this park is all about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have a point there⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you get it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*thump thump*)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, how about this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-How about what?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why don't we do something worth watching?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa⋯ I can't do something like that while people are watching![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Awww⋯ Hehe, so innocent, so pure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so annoying.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Once you get a little older, stuff like that will turn you on. Someday you'll understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even want to understand.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, that's what makes you so innocent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the–?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]How about it? Right here, on this bench?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Tehehe, you're blushing! How adorable. I'm joking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You are?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heehee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who this woman is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She totally got me.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let me answer your question. I work very hard to keep my 34 - 23 - 33 proportions consistent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's pretty impressive⋯ I-I mean![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer my question.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What was it again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you in the park at night? Why were you spying on Toyotomi and them? Why were you filming? Why⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* First off, that's a lot of questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So how about some answers?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's a secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But because you're cute, I could tell you my three sizes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You already told me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is so hard to deal with.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Anyway, I'm very interested in you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*thump thump*)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You were on the right track, so why would you do something as sad as peeping on someone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I wasn't peeping on anyone.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then why are you here, right now, when only Peeping Toms are here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was⋯ I was following this guy Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's his name.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh! I get it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're playing for the opposite team, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What do you mean⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What a loss. You've got such a nice face, but if you're gay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]G-Gay?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah, if you had to choose, you'd be more attracted to men, right? I mean, you really are cute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, I'm the opposite! The total opposite![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whoa, calm down there. It's okay to be gay, and you shouldn't be discriminated for it at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, I'm not gay.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, it's fine. Gays have rights, too. They've ruled it unconstitutional to mentally or occupationally discriminate against someone based on sexuality. I think it was America that did that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am 100 percent not gay![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then why were you peeping on Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't peeping. That guy is⋯ He was with some bad looking dudes, so I figured I'd follow him.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh, oh really? What's your relation to him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's Ayumi's⋯ I mean my mom's⋯ Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Holy cow⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All of a sudden I'm giving her info about myself.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is with this lady?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that bastard Toyotomi to you, anyway?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So you do know him. Hmph. Are you related to the company?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm related to someone related to the company.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So you're basically strangers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that. Toyotomi is a complete stranger to me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because, I⋯ Hey, I'm the one asking questions here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, right. What did you ask? My three sizes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know how to handle this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't seem like a bad lady, but she won't let her guard down⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's how it feels⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so shiny it looks like it sparkles.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her mid-length hair is beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's light illuminating it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although I'm very curious to see what's going on inside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should already know the answer to that question.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Use common sense. I can't do that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you want to see, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, what a nice breeze⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ah⋯ Hehe. You're very forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're very direct, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, being so straightforward is good once in a while I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa. That's a pretty bold outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't keep myself from staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry, but I can't give you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never said I wanted it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she likes shiny stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Fashionable clothes and shiny jewelry. A very mature combination.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't she get cold with her stomach exposed that much?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No use worrying about it, I suppose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to rub my cheeks against and lick that beautiful navel of hers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Psh. Not even in my dreams.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you laughing about all of a sudden? You're so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling she's being provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's that kind of pose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are provocative hands, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful, but I don't know if I can trust her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this lady right in front of me?)[%p]
