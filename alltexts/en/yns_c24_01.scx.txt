[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I found the secret papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make Ayumi feel better with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she is working, she should be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if I can go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can hear noises from inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi is inside the company building at this hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I was supposed to meet Yuuki back at⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no way that Mio is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi took off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A security card is in my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I have a security card, can't I go inside and reach Ayumi's office?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't have a security card now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I can't believe she saw me talking to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, I bet I can't go inside. Even for immediate family members, it's difficult to get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, I've been inside once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was when I delivered papers for Ayumi that she needed for work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She couldn't start the meeting without them, so I delivered them for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I have something that's related to the company, I can get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that jerk isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where they held the briefing yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Although, it was more like a protest rally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I can't get inside like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no protest groups anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apparently, the briefing is going to start here soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is supposed to be leading it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't go inside anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I get tired just by coming here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't seem to find her. I feel like we keep missing each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surprisingly dark. I wish it were brighter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light post. It'll probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime now, so the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lights are shining. It looks like bugs are gathering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's relatively high, and also those are barbed wires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks to be used as a guard fence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it surrounds the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barbed wires at the top of the wall, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's charged with a high-voltage current like in the movies, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't look at it too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of the light post, I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps it is wired in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯ Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics Japan Geological Engineering Laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can climb over it easily, but that might cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the security guard isn't there, it's no problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it's easy to climb over, that's why I should be cautious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I try going over it, they might shoot me with a laser or something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I could easily go over this railway crossing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But as soon I try going over it, the guards will jump on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get in trouble if I'm walking around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean I can go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I have nothing to do inside the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't here, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I have nothing to do inside the building now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't here. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she's not here, I can't go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no time for that at this moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a security guard inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the guard walking around somewhere during the daytime?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this place could be empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I go inside without asking anyone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She rushed into the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she's not here that much during the daytime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the security guard isn't inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I only see the female guard. I don't see Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to be hanging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that security guard here?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you there.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What are you doing up at this hour?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯hi.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You should go to bed, kiddo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯there's something I want to ask you.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Ayumi⋯ I mean, Chief Arima come here?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Chief Arima? She left already, a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]She has a TV shoot tonight. I think that's what I heard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where could she have gone then?)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]*sigh* You're the second person to ask for her tonight. She is so popular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I the second person?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, she is beautiful. People always wonder where she is. Hmmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, I'm the second person?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]A little while ago, maybe about an hour ago. Someone came to ask me about her whereabouts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know if her name was Kaori?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, I have to answer this call. I wonder what's going on so late⋯ Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes, this is the front gate. What? Yes⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what they're talking about.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Excuse me?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm?)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]O-Okay, right away⋯ Yes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm sorry, I have urgent business to attend to. You should leave now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I wonder what⋯ Sorry, I'm in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what you were saying earlier.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Earlier?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You told me I was the second person that asked for Chief Arima, right?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes, I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The person who asked about Ayumi⋯ Did she look like a model?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]No, it was Mr. Toyotomi. He's an employee of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hurry, go away now. There might be some trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi was trying to find Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought it was the woman that I met earlier, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could all of this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of which, I had a strange feeling about that guy Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, at the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If my intuition is correct, Ayumi is⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Sorry, but I just received orders to interrogate everyone on company property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by that? I didn't do anything.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It seems like there was an illegal trespassing into Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An illegal trespassing?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]So, you are no exception.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can that be?)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm sorry, but I'd appreciate it if you would cooperate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An intruder?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I don't have time to be involved in this now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If my intuition is correct, Ayumi is in danger.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I⋯ I have some urgent matter.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, hey you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this the bad feeling I was sensing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If my intuition is correct, it's going to be seriously bad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The guard is watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, the security at this company is not too strictly enforced.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's try this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! What the heck are you doing?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh! Yes, I uh, I've been reserving my energy to prepare for unexpected situations and⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You! If you do that again, I'm going to call the guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What you just said⋯doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Shush⋯ This TV drama is just now getting to the best part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, for real?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the security at this company is not strictly enforced at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's watching TV again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should teach her a lesson.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! The chief is here![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes, chief. Have a good day at work sir⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, I don't have time for this. You shouldn't mess with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, you're busy watching TV.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Please⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is kind of fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know she's not going to be here anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's thrown her legs on the desk and is watching TV. Is that really a way to serve as a security guard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she saw me.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, it's you again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well hello. It looks like you're not here that much during the daytime.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm often working security inside during the day. Whew, I feel like I'm working more than I get paid for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I heard that the commotion at the briefing was pretty bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, looks like it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I heard that a man calmed everyone down and got things settled. I wonder who it was. Sounds cool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Why are you laughing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're already on the company's private property so don't stay here too long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nobody's in the guard house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a storehouse for security guards⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like anyone's here right now. What happened to that security guard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big antenna⋯ I don't think it's for watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big parabolic antenna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they are doing satellite communication with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dome. But I don't know what they use this for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dome like a planetarium attached to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what they use it for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can hear noises from inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like my school, the building height doesn't exceed four stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are ordinances that state the maximum height of buildings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I climb up here, I can probably get to the entrance of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope⋯ I thought I nearly died climbing all the way here, and there's still more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I get to the company building, I'm gonna pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like some kind of directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where I found the 20th page of the document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where I found the 20th page of the document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't find anything in a shrub⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some difficult mathematical equations and graphs written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's numbered 「20」 at the bottom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the 20th page of a document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a document be in the shrub?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Feels nice with lots of green in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is filled with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think these plants are native to around here⋯still, at least the architect has good taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really matches the building in a nice way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring at the sky won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a clear blue sky. If I keep looking at it, I'll end up having neck pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could just disappear into the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is already inside Geo Technics property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any business at Geo Technics anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to find Ayumi now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, looks like nobody's here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And I have a security card to get me through.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey! What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm not trying to go inside without permission or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯wait a minute, you're–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, hello.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I want to ask you the same question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who the hell is this woman⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]「Who the hell is this woman⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what you're thinking, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, look at you. I'm good at reading people's minds. It comes with my profession.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I am Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry for not introducing myself earlier, but as you know I am a very popular newscaster. Okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're⋯ Carrie–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No, no, no. Ka-o-ri. Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You better call me by my name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kaori⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup, good job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make fun of me. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why, because I wanted to meet you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You know the situation inside the building, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The situation inside?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh sweetie, you're so behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want you to talk to me like that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Pfft! Is that a joke?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, don't get so upset. You're Takuya, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit responding with questions like a Zen monk. I'm asking what do you mean by the trouble inside the building?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't you know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that silence?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, I guess you'll find out sooner or later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Listen carefully.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Geo Technics announced informally that some important confidential papers were stolen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Secret papers were stolen?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that why it's noisy? What a dangerous world.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, how does that have anything to do with my mental attitude?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm, it seems like you'd be okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That was only the first part. Let me continue. The person who is suspected of the crime is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I couldn't hear you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Listen up, it's your mother, Ayumi Arima. She's been suspected to have stolen the secret papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, you really didn't know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you say that again? Ayumi did what?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]W-Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say it![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let go. Ugh, that hurts. Don't grab me so hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]When you hold a woman, do it softly. It's a cardinal rule.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say it one more time![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I know how you feel, but that's the fact.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, some things are still uncertain, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even believe half of it. Ayumi would never do something like that![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Nothing I can do about it. The upper staff members of the company came to that conclusion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I shouldn't be upset at you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, you're quick to understand things. Smart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can understand, but I can't agree. Why would Ayumi steal a secret document? She's the head facilitator and–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]She's already been dismissed from her position.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may be right, but why would she take the document?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If she brings it to another company, they may offer a huge amount of money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are you kidding me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi wouldn't do something like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, she just went to dinner and⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dinner?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wrote that she was going to dinner. If she stole the secret document, she wouldn't write that kind of memo.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯it's Toyotomi. He did it. He took the papers, didn't he?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I saw you guys. Kaori, you were talking to Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Didn't I tell you that peeping is not good?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just happened to witness it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And you just happened to hear things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That doesn't matter right now. Anyway, you know Toyotomi, don't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, I do know him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, you can't criticize people without any evidence. The only fact there is now, is the fact that Ayumi stole the papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't buy that. No way it's true⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ah, but it is true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your mother⋯ Ayumi? The fact that she stole the papers has already been proven.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let me finish. That's the fact, but it's not necessarily the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]How about we make a deal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A deal?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you give me the [20th Document Page], I will help you clear the suspicion cast on Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I thought you had it with you⋯ Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't agree with Toyotomi, so I think Ayumi really doesn't know where the document is.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I think it's not a bad deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I supposed to do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going in, I should check the guard house first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a good time now. I'll be finished if I get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't I check if the security guard is there or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, I look just like a thief. Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's better to come and go with a purpose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to be caught by Toyotomi or the guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. The guard isn't here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I've got a security card in my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I get caught, I'll deal with it when it happens. For now, I just want to see her and talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do not have a security card in my hand though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, I'll give it a try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. I can't go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is a lock at the entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Also, I don't want to go inside now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I'll sneak into the building.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I knew it wouldn't work.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You again. Don't come here too often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it doesn't look like the security guard is here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, so the guard is here.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You again. Don't come here too often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The security guard isn't here, but I still can't go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like Toyotomi isn't here either, so I won't go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't enter even if I'm her immediate family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go inside without permission, I'd cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there is something special that I have to do, it's a different story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I should find Ayumi quick and give this to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I should go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried about Ayumi though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, staying here won't help at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
