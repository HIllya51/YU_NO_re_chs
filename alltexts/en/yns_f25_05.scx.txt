[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Kaori isn't here.[%p]
[name]Shop Assistant[line]Excuse me, but who are you're looking for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uhm⋯ A woman with mid-length hair that looks like a flirt.[%p]
[name]Shop Assistant[line]Would you happen to be Takuya Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, why?[%p]
[name]Shop Assistant[line]There's a note for you here from Ms. Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Shop Assistant[line]It says she's waiting for you at the hotel, Room 1101.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Room 1101 at the hotel?[%p]
[name]Shop Assistant[line]Yes. She said you would understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Shop Assistant[line]Well then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The hotel⋯ Perhaps she's talking about the one you can see from downtown, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's waiting there for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antique-style light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty old-looking light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it really sets the atmosphere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't feel like Kaori is coming out any time soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she's not. She's waiting inside the hotel for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bathroom's in the back on the left side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt she's stuck on the toilet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking about it, she's probably waiting for me inside the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at this table isn't going to suddenly summon Kaori⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's inside the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori isn't sitting here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She isn't sitting here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she went home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light hanging down like some kind of plump eggplant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could Kaori be in here⋯? Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Kaori is waiting for me inside the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what the person said, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the caf⑮'s style of choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These curtains are rather unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rolling screens have become more popular recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what this is, but I think it's supposed to be art.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's really not a good time to be admiring paintings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did I come here for? I need to find Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori isn't going to be around here though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's at the hotel⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, a hotel, you say?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You're very forward. You should try to be more subtle when you flirt with a woman.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I don't know any beautiful girls except myself.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You said she was a cutie with mid-length hair, right?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Go on, strain your eyes. Hey, don't look under my skirt.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]A cute woman with mid-length hair that looks like a flirt?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Tehehe, there's someone like that right in front of you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hey, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Man[line]A hotel around here? Only one I know is at the edge of downtown.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Did you know sometimes famous people stay there?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I don't know anyone with mid-length hair.[%p]
[name]Man[line]You asking if I saw a girl with mid-length hair that looks like a flirt?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Sorry, but that's not really my thing.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What, you want to go to a hotel with me?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I'm actually straight, so no thanks.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Huh? Kaori Asakura, in this caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Man[line]There's no way a famous person like that would come here.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Huh? Kaori Asakura?[%p]
[name]Man[line]She's on that popular news program, News Presence, right? I watch it all the time.[%p]
[name]Man[line]She talks pretty harsh for having such a cute face.[%p]
[name]Man[line]But that might just be why modern men support her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the shrubbery isn't going to make Kaori pop out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's waiting inside the hotel for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shrubs⋯ Kaori isn't in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be hilarious if she were hiding behind here, but of course she's not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is pretty empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fancy, yet it's not that crowded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll look for Kaori a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a jukebox.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like song number 1 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 2 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 3 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 4 is playing right now.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Song number 8 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 9.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 10 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is no time to be kicking back and listening to tunes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want it to stop, hit the EXIT button on the bottom right and things will go back to normal.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm gonna go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song really makes this place feel like a caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of when I talked to Ms. Eriko on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song has a somber mood to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song puts me on edge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me want to jump for joy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song brings back so many memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm moving outside when I listen to this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason I want to call for my big brother when I hear this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The poppy rhythms in this song sound so fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me feel like I need to stay up all night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of that one game.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listening to this song makes me realize there's some strange music in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, pressing that isn't going to do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Press the button.[%p]
