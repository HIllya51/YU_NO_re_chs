[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Ryuuzouji, the headmaster. What is he doing here?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is everything all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was just looking for someone.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]In the laboratory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯they're not here though.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]How is Ayumi doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, no cancer, no leukemia, and no AIDS, so I guess she's doing fine.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. She seems strong, but she has her weaknesses. At least, that's what I heard from Koudai⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Ayumi is a former student of yours.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, to be more specific she's a former student of Koudai, your father's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I only lectured at one of her seminars. It seems like she was very impressed with Koudai's research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So my old man made a move on his student?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, it would seem so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, that's just how things ended up. When two people are in love, neither their age, social class, nor nationality matter anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She was a very clever, intellectual, and superb student. She could have been a great researcher had she stayed with the university, but alas.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Ayumi was an excellent student.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems kind of spacey to me.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I heard you're quite interested in history, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ms. Ichijou told me. You come to the laboratory for your studies quite frequently, she says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I guess so.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Like father, like son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you were good friends with my old⋯ I mean, my father?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, we've been tied by fate since our college days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was my father researching?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Have you really not heard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So you haven't received anything from him either, hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you yesterday. He didn't leave me anything. His death was sudden, after all.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. I'm sorry for your loss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We were in the midst of a cooperative research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were researching stuff together with my old man?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It is very unfortunate that he died. This may not be the best time to mention it, but I would very much like to obtain some documents from our joint research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So my old man and Ryuuzouji were researching something together.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what it was⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you researching with my old man?[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Ryuuzouji, a car has arrived for you downstairs and⋯oh.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's the matter, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]N-Nothing. It's just that your car is here. What would you like to do?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. I see.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I would like to sit down for a talk with you some time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]About your father, and about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now if you'll excuse me⋯ Mitsuki, shall we?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm sorry, but I have some things I need to take care of in the research laboratory first.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. I'll be waiting for you downstairs.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh, that freaked me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me too. I couldn't believe such a beauty appeared right before me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah, same as always then. Ha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard you were looking for me?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. I wanted to ask what you were planning on doing now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right now?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. How about go home, take a dump, and go to sleep?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, you idiot. I'm not talking about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. Everyone is asking me about that though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm planning on finishing school for now. I don't know what will come after that though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So you're not dropping out of Sakaimachi Academy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. I'll be sad to see you leave though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm relieved to hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What were talking to him about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who, Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man and stuff.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think someone's calling for you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sounds like it. I hope we can talk again soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, me too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school physician Ms. Eriko said she wanted to talk to you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ms. Takeda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, thank you. See you around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was Ryuuzouji doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is right there in front of me. Should I talk to him?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the headmaster of Sakaimachi Academy, Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hear he oversees the other academy, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So he's Mitsuki's employer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Always sucking on a big brown cigar.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Don't make it sound so disgusting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's totally different from the cigarettes Ms. Eriko smokes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like a pretty fancy cigar.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This locker is bigger than I thought. I bet two people could fit in here.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll pass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one wants to go in there with an old man like you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just saying how you're such an elegant, refined, and handsome middle aged man.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. You'll end up the same in about 30 years or so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like two people can fit in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no reason for me to go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Un, deux, trois.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not so sure myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is looking at me funny.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waaaauuhhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Why are you shaking your head like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is making me tired. I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It makes me tired when I go so hard.)[%p]
