[name]Mio[line]What is going on here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's nothing we can do but go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have a lot of other things I need to do⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to save Yuuki⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to save Mitsuki somehow⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a long path.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How far does it go?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just hope I didn't go in a huge circle and end up back where I started.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's getting brighter. Mio![%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's the exit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The exit⋯ Could it be?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya, look! It's so bright! It's the exit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really the exit?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's getting brighter⋯ We found the way out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dead end⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We've come this far⋯just to find a dead end?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do we do? We can't just stay here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I supposed to do?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait a minute. Let's look around a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This⋯ This might be the exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, we should hurry and leave through here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You just want to leave with this amazing discovery right in front of us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you feel anything, Takuya? This might be a huge discovery for hist–no, for humanity itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess her fanatic blood is up again⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She was the one who said she wanted to get out of here quick.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It would be a pity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't like this. Let's get out of here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? With this historical discovery right in front of us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, all right. But I'm coming back after we safely make it out of here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we safely make it out⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What does this mean⋯ What is the machine's function?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's extremely close to your theory, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were trying to link the tapestry to the ruins⋯to this place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yeah, I was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't understand what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that weird machine noise is coming from over there⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The humming sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. From that black part.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's resonating, so it sounds like it's coming from all around us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Makes me feel like I'm on pins and needles.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You mean you're nervous?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I feel a physical numbness. Look at the hairs on my legs.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're standing up, dummy. Your hair is doing the same thing, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like when you rub cloth with plastic. We're full of static electricity.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Static electricity?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's evidence that this machine is running.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Touch it, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know that it feels like vinyl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that. The heat⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little warm.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're right. It is warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means the machine is still running.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What does it do⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the most important question.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is its purpose?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A giant machine inside Triangle Mountain⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The heavy sound of machinery⋯and the frequent lightning strikes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The machine coated in vinyl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm starting to understand.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There are some parts that are delicate, and some not so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I agree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it feels⋯strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's because it's rusty. It's because of the material.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It kinda feels like it's coated in vinyl.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're right. It feels rather strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it means something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty brittle⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what it's here for, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some parts of it are pretty beat up.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Could it really be more than eight thousand years old?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's red. Could it be rust on it?[%p]
*shf shf*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It crumbled away just with one touch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some parts of it are pretty brittle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it broken?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But I can hear the heavy sound of machinery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I can hear it, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is this machine making that sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like that woman isn't here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like that woman isn't here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When I was waiting for my old man at the base of Triangle Mountain⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She reminded me of the woman who died in front of me back then.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that woman is gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was she just a hallucination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not it. I'm sure I saw her. I followed her here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What was she like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She had golden hair and a gentle smile⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When she was near, she made me feel safe⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph, I guess my smile isn't that great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a steep incline⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's high. Climbing it isn't an option.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That cliff wall of boulders goes up to the top⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If we were outside, we'd be looking at the Sword Cape⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think so.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That would be a pity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't like this. Let's get out of here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? With this historical discovery right in front of us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, all right. But I'm coming back after we safely make it out of here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we safely make it out⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What does this mean⋯ What is the machine's function?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's extremely close to your theory, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were trying to link the tapestry to the ruins⋯to this place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yeah, I was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't understand what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that weird machine noise is coming from over there⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The humming sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. From that black part.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's resonating, so it sounds like it's coming from all around us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Makes me feel like I'm on pins and needles.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You mean you're nervous?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I feel a physical numbness. Look at the hairs on my legs.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're standing up, dummy. Your hair is doing the same thing, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like when you rub cloth with plastic. We're full of static electricity.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Static electricity?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like that's the main unit⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what it's for, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As far as I can see, it looks like that black pillar is the machine's main unit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's where that grating noise is coming from.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But if that's the case⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Doesn't it mean that this machine has been running for at least eight thousand years?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, maybe.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you know?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Around here, anything seems to be possible.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what is that black pillar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It goes all the way up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a black pillar, and it's giving off a sheen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be metal.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No way. They didn't have the polishing techniques to give metal a sheen like that in the ancient world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By that logic, this machine shouldn't exist either.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks bright up top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it already be morning?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Isn't it pretty bright up there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it is.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It might lead outside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what's up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You keep looking up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I think I understand what it does.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You understand what this machine does?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You shouldn't look at it so closely⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that light gets in your eyes, you'll go blind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how tall it is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it just emitted a blazing amount of light⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A-Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯one second. My sight's coming back now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That flash was like a strobe light. What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It blinded me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It came from up top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Come on, Takuya, don't you remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The thing we saw at Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I agree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shining light⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And people suffering?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how high up that is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really high.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would make sense if we're inside Triangle Mountain⋯inside Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Unbelievable⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How did you find this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We searched so much⋯ Well, what we were able to search was only a small area though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Still⋯ I don't think it was a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wasn't.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So how did you find it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I followed a woman.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. She appeared in front of me⋯ Like she was beckoning me. I followed her, and I ended up here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You mean there's someone here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if it was a person or not.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But you just said it was a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And you're saying it wasn't a person?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now, why don't we check this thing out a little more?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah⋯ Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just what is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know that⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. It looks like your theory was correct, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It can't be![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's your theory.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯ This⋯ This is beyond any discovery. This must be some kind of joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish it were. But in the end it was no paper tiger.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know⋯ The reality is right here in front of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't believe my own eyes. So Sword Cape is actually a huge structure built around a machine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one will believe it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯ It's eight thousand years old. It's impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you just say that there can be no academic development without going against previous theories?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-I did, but this is too irrational.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you're not wrong. This is the first time I've seen something this insane.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this what Professor Imagawa was after?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A giant machine?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Built eight thousand years ago?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So, just for the sake of argument, we'll say this machine was built eight thousand years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But if so, what was it built for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I was thinking, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What would a tower-like machine be needed for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could its purpose possibly be⋯?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But no matter how you look at it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like something natural.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's looks like a machine. This is first time I've seen something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A machine.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is something like this here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like now isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
