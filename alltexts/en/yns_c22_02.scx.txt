[name]Takuya[line]I chased Ryuuzouji here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he isn't around. Where'd he go?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Looking for somebody?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh, looks like you've found your way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ah, it must be due to chaos correction. It appears that memories become fragmented upon passing the Neumann boundary condition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've been waiting for you. You won't get away this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Ryuuzouji saying?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I know you have it. Give it to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get real. I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ughh⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's happening? I'm getting dizzy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it because of his eyes?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, showing resistance to Niarb. I wonder what factor is causing this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's happening. I can't stand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Look into my eyes. Good, just like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, good. You're getting sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What⋯my eyelids⋯are getting heavy.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hahaha, just like that.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Unlike last time, another accident surely won't occur this time around.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I feel some kind of factor here at Sword Cape, but⋯never mind that.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, leave the rest to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You shouldn't have come here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, I'm sure that goes for both of us.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So why did I come here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ryuuzouji go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some kind of letters. No need to read them now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's said that they were written approximately 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be reading this now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the ground in particular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? What's this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a beautiful jewel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like the one on the Reflector I have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would this be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Jewel 5][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Jewel 5][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]I was pretty sure Ryuuzouji came over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough about that, what about Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure he came here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ryuuzouji isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was already two days ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Ayumi⋯ We were facing off at the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why isn't anyone here now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it all a dream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji drew a gun, and I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is weird. Where did Ryuuzouji go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure he came here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is weird. He should definitely be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji has to be somewhere.[%p]
