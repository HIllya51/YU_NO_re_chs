[name]Ayumi[line]I feel like I'm alive again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, it does feel really nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I haven't spent a relaxing day at the park in a long time⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, after this we'll head to the laboratory⋯ Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the matter? Aren't you happy?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am happy, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what's wrong.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You may not be the Takuya that I know, I understand that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way to know for certain. However, there's a high possibility that the old bastard is alive⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ If Koudai is alive, what should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm with you, now, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Of course, I like Koudai. I love him. But I love you just as much, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What should I do if Koudai suddenly returns?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that she mentions it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If the old man appears⋯ Hahaha! I guess we'd be fighting over the same girl.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯do I really want⋯to lose you⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To my old man?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we⋯get married?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting⋯dizzy⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯ My body is⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ Wh-What's wrong⋯ That⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Body⋯is⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying? I can't hear you⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Takuya⋯ Takuya!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Why are you so far away?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come closer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you going⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Closer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We just⋯promised⋯we'd be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why⋯are you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So far⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is⋯around me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Turning⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]White⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My head hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My cheeks, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stings⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ Ayumi and I were⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was⋯ Yeah. I was going to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold. I wonder why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a bed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, this is where I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She feels so⋯dear to me⋯ Why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ At the base of Triangle Mountain, she and Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ I have to find her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I said I need my Father's Letter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to either use the map to jump or start over with 「Keep Map and Items.」)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Great⋯now I'm talking nonsense.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well⋯ I'll go get my Father's Letter.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just⋯ Can you wait a minute?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to get my Father's Letter⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I show her my Father's Letter⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Uh-oh⋯ That reminds me, I don't have my Father's Letter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where did I lose it? Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I go back for it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This conversation won't go anywhere without my Father's Letter.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai was the first one to discover it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man discovered that ore?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. It seems Koudai planned to analyze and use that stone somehow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. What is the stone you're talking about?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's called the Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hyper⋯what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hy-per-sense Stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ That phrase: Hypersense Stone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I keep hearing it, but what does it mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing⋯ I don't know. I'm a little dizzy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Were you looking at the sun too much?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry⋯ I killed the conversation, didn't I? Please, continue. What is that stone?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Th-That's right⋯ The ore is incredibly unstable. The components change greatly the moment it's removed from the ore vein.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So we needed a way to preserve it. The formula was written on the document you found.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Still, it only lasts for a few days at a time. The method hasn't been perfected yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so valuable about something so unstable?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The stone has some strange properties. It reacts to human consciousness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Human consciousness?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]To put it simply, if you concentrate while you're near the stone, it will respond to your presence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Respond how?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, there will be a miniscule electrical current⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, that's it? What use would that have?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, this could be the greatest discovery of the century.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something that useless? I mean, it's just a miniscule electrical current, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It doesn't matter whether it's useful or not from an engineering perspective.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Think about it. It's 「a stone that reacts to human consciousness,」 right? Has anything like that ever been discovered in the entire world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that you say it⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If we can understand the principle behind it, it could revolutionize physics and engineering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the one who discovered it was my old man.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ That's why I've been carrying on Koudai's research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, so it's out of academic curiosity.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, that's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I continued the research partly out of academic curiosity, but not only that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then⋯why?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Because⋯ Koudai may be out there, somewhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, I sound stupid, don't I? I don't know why, but that's what I believe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So⋯ I thought if I continued the research, maybe I could see Koudai again⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was doing⋯the same thing!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I should tell Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](About me, and about my Father's Letter⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But if I show her my old man's letter, she'll⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit⋯ My eyes kinda hurt⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi looks a little blurry⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it⋯ I know. I should show her my Father's Letter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I ask you something?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I'll answer if I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing at that company?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard you were continuing my father's research.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Where did you hear that, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you know⋯ It was just something I heard around town. It was a rumored at the construction site.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe that was a bad excuse.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right. I don't want to hide anything from you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You know that Geo Technics is doing construction on the coastline now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You've heard that it's a geological survey, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. They doing some geological survey work for the company's building expansions, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That is a complete lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Their real goal is something else entirely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I ask what it is?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll tell you⋯ It has to do with your father, Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A huge ore vein was discovered on the coastline in front of Geo Technics⋯no, I should say it was found beneath the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ore vein? You mean like the stuff you find in cracked boulders or whatever?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right. The problem was the ore in that vein.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ore? Was it diamonds or something?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It might be even more valuable than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Geo Technics' real goal is mining and analyzing that ore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mining the ore?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And analyzing it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something more valuable than diamonds⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the old man⋯ How should I put this⋯ What was my father like?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh? I think you know best, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, but I was thinking there's a side to a man that only a wife would know.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm⋯ That's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. (Okay, I got her to talk.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Unraveling the threads of history was his life's purpose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That guy⋯ He'll never change.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe this is the Ayumi who knows the real me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhm⋯ Not the night before last, but the night before that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you go to Triangle Mountain with Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm, three nights ago⋯ I think we had dinner together. I got home early.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just as I thought. This Ayumi is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I ended up playing hooky from work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's nice.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, you should look more apologetic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Because you're the one who got horny all of the sudden, so I couldn't go to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's all my fault, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's true, though, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, I confess. Ayumi, you're–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek⋯ Wh-What are you trying to say? We're in public.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean it. Ayumi, you're–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]N-No. Don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're⋯the one who made me breakfast.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is so peaceful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When we're like this⋯ It's nice⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just so peaceful. I got a little drowsy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This reminds me of when I was a student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't get all misty-eyed. It was just a couple years ago, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See? You're still young.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, thank you. You're the only one who says that to me. Oh, and Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The old man⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks a little serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's giving me a kind smile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a bright expression⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just like the weather right now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look so good with your glasses off, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I've always worn them on purpose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? Why?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Because⋯ I wanted to see your reaction once I took them off, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is down now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This style also looks nice.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'd like to keep my hairstyle this way from now on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think that's a good idea.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's no reason to put it up anymore⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Does it look bad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Should I tie my hair up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not at all. I think this looks great too.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you⋯ That makes me happy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You keep looking at my face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a casual glance⋯)[%p]
*stare*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's not casual at all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not that you shouldn't look, but when you do, try to be casual about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Look casually⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's skirt. It's riding up a little.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm the only one who can see it from this angle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, it's up so high⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, what do you keep looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're clasped under your knees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hands are clasped just below your knees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And your knees are raised up high, which is making your skirt ride up, which means I've got a great view of your panties.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect panty show.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, knock it off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your legs are so smooth and beautiful.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't slide your hand up so high.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, all right⋯ Just a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sweet.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey! Don't put your fingers under my skirt⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you say it was all right to touch you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I did, but your hand keeps going higher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes us both happy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your skin feels so nice when you don't wear stockings.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop toying with me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But last night⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek! Don't talk about that in public.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]H-Hey! Everyone can see us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then let's give them a good show.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯ Not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Darn it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a street light for the park, but it's not on right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a street light for the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime now, so of course the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Does someone always turn the park lights on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ I never thought about it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This is great. The shade from the trees feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a certain charm to sprawling out on the grass.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're the only one sprawling, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees of Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These trees see a lot of action at night.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey! That's too blunt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at that blue sky feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is clear and blue.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not the middle of summer, but it's nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is sitting next to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're on the grass at the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sprawled out, and Ayumi is sitting beside me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, we look like a couple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's nice on the grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is happy; let's keep relaxing on the grass.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The benches over there are life-savers on a hot day.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Honestly, it's still hard to believe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's true though⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's this? An envelope⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it arrived about two nights ago.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Read it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll explain everything afterward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is good. I know Ayumi will understand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And after⋯)
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai⋯ He's alive, and you might not be the Takuya I know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calm down, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So Koudai might be alive somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Does everything I've said so far make sense now?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But⋯uhm, you might not be the Takuya that I know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not too confident about that. Regardless, you're the Ayumi I know, and I am Takuya. Those facts haven't changed, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry. I wouldn't believe it even if you were joking. If you're not joking, I believe it even less.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course you won't believe it right away. I still only half believe it myself.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, I have this device I don't understand, and what I've experienced is undeniable.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai is⋯alive somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That might not be true. What it means is that there might be a world where he's alive.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So⋯ That thing you have⋯ Was it called a Reflector?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Can I see it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure. This is it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's weird, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's small. Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]These are some pretty gems embedded in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, they're called Jewels. They⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's not what I mean. I feel like I've seen them somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've seen them before?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ Something with that exact color and shape.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This indentation⋯ It looks like something fits in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, a pretty crystal-like thing goes in there.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A pretty crystal? What's it look like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know what it is?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ I feel like I've seen it somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've seen them before?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Round and pretty⋯ Like a gemstone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you remember where?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I remember⋯ Yeah, it was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯ I saw it in the laboratory. Yes, I remember asking what it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Next to my office⋯ There was another door, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, come to think of it⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's the door to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you can only open it with a security card⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You have to use another card with it. You need a security card and a Blue Card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A Blue Card?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Think of it as security for the security.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a pretty amazing setup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's actually a pretty low level of security. They're going to install a retinal scanner next.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm, we might be able to get in today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, can't you get in any time if you have the card?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. The light on the card reader has to be blue. When it's red, there's no way to get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So even if you have a card, you can't get in unless the light's blue.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. If you don't ask management to turn the light blue, and you don't have a blue card, you can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's amazing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]About the Blue Card⋯ I have it with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I see it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, it really is blue.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]However, remember only having it won't be enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]May I borrow it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sure, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. I'll need more than this to get inside.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Blue Card][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Blue Card][color index="800000"].
[name]Ayumi[line]That thing that looks like an orb was in the laboratory. I think it's part of what they're researching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If I could show that to you, maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might be able to see my father again.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was the Jewel located?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Uhm, I think it was behind the projector⋯on the right side on the column case for the Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Behind the projector⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I shouldn't show that to Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That has nothing to do with this right now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the right time to use that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's time to talk to Ayumi.)[%p]
