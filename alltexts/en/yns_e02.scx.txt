[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh. The TV was left on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi's back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she came home for a minute and then left again.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((⋯In light of this, it appears the mayor plans to resign before the council passes a motion of no confidence⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that popular news program, News Presence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman⋯ She was with Ryuuzouji last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the anchor for News Presence.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Due to the resignation of the current mayor, the large-scale geological survey being conducted by Geo Technics will be halted.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics construction will stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What'll happen to the company?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure it will be hard on Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. If News Presence is on, it must be nine o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then there's still a bit of time before ten.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't seen Ayumi yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet Ayumi is still at work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's ringing so loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi went out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That envelope on the table looks familiar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, this is my father's letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's it doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. It must have fallen out of my pocket last night when I was looking for medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Father's Letter][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Father's Letter][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Looks like Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she was here, I could ask her about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she was here, I could ask her about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I need some medicine to get the fever down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mother used that stuff a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At least, that's what the old bastard told me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really remember what my mother was like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even have a picture of her. That old bastard got rid of everything that reminded him of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if my mother was sick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she got fevers all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like Kanna right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, this is it. I'm sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's still some left. I can bring this to Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put it in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Something fell out of my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just get this, and this, and⋯ That's everything.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((That is the current situation.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((⋯as well, and News Presence will continue to report thoroughly on this incident as it unfolds.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, the TV's on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that popular news program, News Presence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen that newscaster a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. I saw her with Ryuuzouji downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks a little different, but I'm sure that's her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her name is Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'm sure. It says so on the screen, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that woman is a newscaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I recognized her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she doing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Now let's talk with the one responsible for overseeing the construction.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Let's talk to the Head Facilitator, Arima.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Head Facilitator Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman on the left is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's turn up the volume.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((So, Ms. Arima, you claim the company is blameless?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes. Normally, no one would ever expect lightning to strike coastal construction work, so there was no way to prepare for it at all.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is talking on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pressing her for information about the construction accident.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Yet lightning struck again today. And it may strike again in the future.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Well, that is⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Are you aware the public is demanding the company take responsibility?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((You are on this show to tell us exactly what caused this, not to make excuses.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pretty much bullying her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in a real bind. Damn, that reporter is a bitch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure she's just another gossip hyena that calls herself a journalist.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((According to the weather map, the coastline was experiencing extremely fair weather at the time. A lightning strike would have been very unlikely.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, I am aware.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Could it be that it wasn't a lightning strike and instead a mistake on the part of the construction company?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((No, that can't be. Lightning striking has nothing to do with whether the skies above are cloudy or clear.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((What do you mean?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((There are cases when lightning strikes from clouds up to six miles away.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((So lightning doesn't always strike directly below where it formed.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Then why is it that in the span of just a few weeks, there have been three recorded lightning strikes in the same area?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((W-We're⋯ Looking into that right now.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Why don't you wait to resume construction till after you find out what's causing it?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((W-Well⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Despite not knowing the cause of these lightning strikes, you won't stop the construction. Why is that?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Don't you think it's disrespectful to those who lost family members to the accident?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Of course we do⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Not too talkative anymore, I see. Why don't we change the subject then?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((What about the rumors saying some kind of deal is going down between upper management at Geo Technics and the local government administration?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((That's a baseless rumor.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Is it, really?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((It really is⋯ I think.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((But, Head Facilitator Arima, you're⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, this lady Kaori is such a bitch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is having a lot of trouble in the studio right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm done watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I've got the fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't Ayumi back yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's still at work.[%p]
