[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh. I'm so tired, I can feel it in my bones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already been more than a dozen hours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I brought plenty of water, but walking in this desert heat for even half a day has worn me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However⋯she doesn't have any water, clothes, or equipment. After being alone and unprotected for so long, is she even still alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know! Maybe I was so mean to her that she got fed up and went back to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Without food or water?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, maybe she left the desert right away and went into the forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. If that was the case, she would have just come home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, shit, shit!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I abandon her?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line](Why are you giving up without even looking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line](What are you doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It-It's you⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line](Why are you giving up without even looking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯ I don't know where to look.[%p]
[name]Man[line](I see.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Listen to me: I walk two miles per hour. If I walk for five hours⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line](Goodness, you really are pathetic.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Man[line](You're just making excuses so you don't have to feel guilty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line](But your heart is filled with regret. You can't cover that up with your ridiculous logic.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Man[line](Hitting too close to home, aren't I?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you're right, okay? So what would you do if you were me?[%p]
[name]Man[line](There is a way to look for her. Think about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How? I'm not omniscient.[%p]
[name]Man[line](You're useless. Haven't you heard her voice?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her voice? She can't talk⋯ No, wait. I heard it once when Illia was fighting a monster.[%p]
[name]Man[line](You're wrong.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Man[line](I'm telling you to listen to the voice of her heart.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The voice of her heart?[%p]
[name]Man[line](You have to open your ears and your heart. Can't you hear her voice?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't hear it! I don't have any special abilities like that.[%p]
[name]Man[line](You've heard the voice of her heart once before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once?[%p]
[name]Man[line](Remember⋯ You saved her, didn't you?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saved her?[%p]
[name]Man[line](Beyond space and time, beyond this world, she found you. And you guided her after she collapsed and nearly died in the desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes almost died? And I helped her?[%p]
[name]Man[line](Yes. Listen with all your heart. Open your ears to her voice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line](Over here!)[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Old man⋯ I think I just heard something![%p]
[name]Man[line](Hahahah!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't just laugh. Say something, you old bastard![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof! Ouch! I fell right out of bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I know I heard something just now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her voice, I heard it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Outside! Outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes, answer me. Tell me where you are.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can feel something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the desert. Are you still alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes! But you're weak, almost gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm here! I'm right here![%p]
((I can see the sky.))[%p]
((The sky⋯))[%p]
((The night sky is so bright⋯))[%p]
((Melgio's light shines on me⋯))[%p]
((The light of life⋯))[%p]
((The fire of life wraps me in warmth.))[%p]
((There's⋯something I need to do.))[%p]
((A purpose⋯ What is my purpose?))[%p]
((Calm the fury of nature⋯))[%p]
((Perform the ceremony⋯))[%p]
((Bring about the descension of the goddess Grantia.))[%p]
((Now, I leave on my journey⋯))[%p]
((Where will I journey to?))[%p]
((The bounds of the world?))[%p]
((Just what is out there?))[%p]
((Was my coming here the will of the gods?))[%p]
((Was meeting that person my destiny?))[%p]
((What Mother said⋯ Was it a lie?))[%p]
((No. I believe.))[%p]
((I can feel his breath⋯))[%p]
((I can feel his voice⋯))[%p]
((I was meant to meet you here.))[%p]
((All is the will of the gods⋯))[%p]
((Yes. I know he will come⋯))[%p]
((I know he will come for me. I can feel it.))[%p]
((I can feel your voice⋯))[%p]
((If it's really you, I can leave everything to you⋯))[%p]
((I can endure anything⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard your voice! I don't know how, but I know I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your voice led me here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the middle of this vast desert, somehow I knew exactly where to find you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand it myself, but I knew you were here.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That earthquake⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you hurt?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're fine. I can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's been in the desert for such a long time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And nothing is⋯wrong?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here, take my hand. Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ew, bleh! I hate getting sand in my mouth! Don't pull me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, watch it! Hahahah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are such a goofball![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see the stars. Maybe it's because the moonlight's so bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The night sky here is amazing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a look. The sky is moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That moon is so big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at it makes me sigh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like where I am doesn't matter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe I left you in a place like this⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes' body is warm.[%p]
I've never felt so much affection for someone before. She's so adorable. I can't help it.[%p]
I wonder why?[%p]
Her chest is gently rising and falling. I can see her face in profile and can't help but brush my fingers lightly against her.[%p]
*thump thump* [linebreak]I sense a faint pulse. It's her heart⋯[%p]
As Celes gently takes my face into her hands⋯ I can't help but run my fingers through her tousled hair.[%p]
She slides her hands through my hair and around to cup the nape of my neck.[%p]
That feels nice. It's so warm and gentle.[%p]
Almost like she's⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
I look directly into her face. She gazes into my eyes with a kind, sincere expression.[%p]
I give her a light kiss. She closes her eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you believe I'm considering doing it in the desert? I'm such a sleaze.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you just laugh at me?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I definitely heard you laughing![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And mean girls who laugh at me must be punished! I sentence you to tickling![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I acting so weird?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure you aren't hurt?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're pretty tough! Have you been working out?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*chuckle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your voice⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I think it was more your consciousness than your voice⋯ Regardless, I know I heard something.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ You probably don't know either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even I still doubt it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that voice led me here. I know that's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I know that's true.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to the forest tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll make some food, and⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong? Are you worried?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm all right. I haven't seen any of those weird monsters lately. The forest is perfectly safe⋯ Is it something else?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean me?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't want me to cross the desert again. Is that it?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry. I was acting crazy.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought there was a way home. I thought I wouldn't have to be stuck alone in this strange world forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't thinking straight. Being on my own was so lonely.[%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you pressing up against me? ⋯ Are you saying, I'm not alone?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right. You're here. I'm not alone.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lately, I've just been running around all over the place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's take it easy tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you think that's a good idea, Celes?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sleeping like a baby.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We have to get back to the house before the sun rises.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard the desert can get cold at night, but it's warm with you here beside me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're such a strange person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're so warm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only been a week since we met.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're always warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe I didn't notice that before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaaachoo![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff* For now, I guess I'll have to carry you back to the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, I can't believe it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try to take it easy tomorrow. It's been a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's only wearing an apron⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the good life.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't do stupid stuff like that now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes is diligently cooking in the kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there something I can help her with?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to the bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm leaving for the desert. What do I need to bring with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. Today's my chance to use the bedroom.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a while since I've slept in a real bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay for me to use the bedroom today, right?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted again today.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
*pat pat pat*
[name]Takuya[line]I want to lay down in bed and think about what to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The crystals on the walls and bed frame are glowing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How are they made? They seem so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't any electricity here. It's weird. They do set the mood well, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes and I sleep in different rooms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She sleeps in the bedroom. I've got the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She lets me sleep in the bedroom once a week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the concept of a week doesn't really mean anything here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once a week is just when Celes notices and tells me to do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do get tired of sleeping on a hard floor every night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, that smells kind of good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Celes's scent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why it relaxes me so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes's scent⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's always friendly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And she's pretty cute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But we'll have to say good-bye someday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm only living with her because of our strange circumstances. I can't forget that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to search for a way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Celes⋯ Why is she here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to worry about other people. I know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like Illia said, if I made it here, there must be a way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A way home⋯ A way back to my own world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My own world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I miss my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My home⋯my life⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it was a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That damned letter from my father. That's what changed everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, what are you doing now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯ Mio⋯ Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯ Yuuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa. This is some serious homesickness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never been this homesick before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I'd be able to survive even if I got abandoned in the mountains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back then though, I could always see my old friends. That's probably where that confidence, that sense of safety, came from⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a feeling of safety that comes from knowing there is someone, somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it. If that's the case, then I have to cross that desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard the Imperial Capital is on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Imperial Capital⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of place it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit! I can't die alone in a place like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not like this⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who's there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's you. Of course, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that means I'm not all alone.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was sure today was the day I could sleep in the bed. Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want me to cheer up?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I look that unhappy?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I was smiling as much as I could. Oh well.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm fine, I think. I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, don't just stand there like that. You should get to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! What are you doing?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]P-Put your clothes back on![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't just nod! What are you thinking?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
*pat pat pat*[%p]
*sit*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line](Cheer up⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I must be imagining things.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She can't talk. It's just my imagination.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But Celes's body is so warm.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can hear Celes's heart.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*thump thump*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I'm going to the desert tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]Mm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*zzz⋯zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you really fall asleep that fast? So, you came here to sleep.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a strange person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯ I'm going to the desert tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said I should eventually go to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will I do when I get there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will I do?[%p]
(Help you⋯)[%p]
(Help you.)[%p]
(I must help⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is someone⋯calling me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow! I fell out of bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it was a dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It felt sort of strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was like someone was speaking to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking to me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to try going to the desert today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could see the desert from the top of the hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone said it was called Rafaelo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a one-week walk to the Imperial Capital. That's what Illia said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One week. That's not exactly an easy trip.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I have to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing for me here, anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what about Celes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to leave her by herself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was with me last night, even though I wanted her to go away. Oh, that reminds me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where she went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what's that smell⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells kind of good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
