[name]Takuya[line]I guess Yu-No is trying to convince Celes now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd like to think about some stuff while that's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. Are those footsteps I hear?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's going on?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mom said it was okay![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Now let's start making that dog house. Or a lizard house, I guess.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yay! I love you, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little too early to get so excited. We're gonna have to get that lizard, too⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's Kun-Kun![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's going to be tough raising Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah, I'll do my best![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Good enough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah. It's important that Yu-No wants to do something for someone else.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A pet she can talk to besides Celes and I. Or maybe I should call it a friend?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hope this experience will provide Yu-No what she needs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Plus, once the lizard starts feeling better, we can release it.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, Mom![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay Yu-No. Why don't you take Kun-Kun to the back? I'll be there in a minute.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. You said it was okay?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No was really happy about it. Thanks.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be sure to give you a nice reward tonight.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*blush*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm? What's that you have?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A letter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened? This is⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It fell out of the cupboard while you were cleaning the house?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Neither of us have seen this. It's not like Yu-No wrote it.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might have belonged to Illia⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if Illia wrote this letter, that means it's at least four years old.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How are we supposed to mail it, though?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know how?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I would like to know, just for reference.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. Fly through the sky?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, a bird![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can have a bird carry it?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. They had carrier pigeons way back when in Japan, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you raise a bird the right way and train it well, it'll bring letters almost anywhere you want it to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But does that kind of bird exist around here?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. We need a bird that will go all the way to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I'll leave this to you then. I'm going to go see Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
(I didn't worry about it then.)[%p]
(Never did I think such careless words would lead to that outcome⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stopped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There have been a lot of intermittent earthquakes recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They get more frequent as time passes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's like Illia had said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rage of mother nature is starting to show as it does every few hundred years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A person with wings⋯ That would be like an angel or a harpy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never thought someone like that could exist, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman.
[name]Takuya[line]She said she came here from a far away land.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she came from beyond the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she came across the desert, too. Does that mean she came from the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were those wings, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she was a creation of God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God. How ridiculous. There's no way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no such thing as a human with wings in the first place. It's way too out of the ordinary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out of the ordinary, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then maybe here in Dela Grante, it's perfectly normal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, there was that monster that attacked Celes. It wouldn't seem too far fetched for a human to have wings after seeing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not far fetched, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯there's no other way to describe that thing than as a monster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It did seem humanoid, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I'd never seen a creature like that in my life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯there was that winged woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was intelligent, and seemed to communicate with me through some sort of telepathy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And her child is some kind of lizard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know in bugs, a lot of times the babies look nothing like their parents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe not a lot of times or all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They have completely different living conditions than their parents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But can a creature like that evolve into something like its mother?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking about it, I'm a human. I made it here, surviving in this world. Celes and Illia are humans living in this world, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On top of that, Celes and I had a child together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, this world is all messed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Darwin's survival of the fittest theory says that the strongest will survive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Comparing it to that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Maybe that's only true when confined to the knowledge I have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew. There's no end to this line of thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is negotiating right now, apparently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. I see Kun-Kun got her name from the way she whines.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Such a strange creature. It sounds so sad all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is trying to convince Celes now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be good for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she needs some friends.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would be nice if that creature could be her friend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Birds are singing far in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes everything seem so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet here. It feels so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is trying to convince Celes now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I respect Yu-No's independence. It's up to her to convince Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just a house sitting in a wide open field. A knight named Illia used to live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been a while since I started living in this house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that you can see any difference from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I renovated this place quite a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First, I made Yu-No's room and put it next to our bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is time for her to have her own room, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't all sleep in the same bed forever, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to have to polish the stone soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I polish the stone once a year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A house made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm actually interested in what kind of tactics Yu-No is using.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A plant that emits smoke when you touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a cactus with a bonbon on it. What a strange plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I probably shouldn't touch it carelessly. It'll spit out smoke if I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A girl's autonomy is important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is talking to Celes inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think a girl's autonomy is important. I'll just let her handle the negotiations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me think for a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, we just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd rather take a minute to think.[%p]
