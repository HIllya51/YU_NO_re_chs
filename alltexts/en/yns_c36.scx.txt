[name]Kaori[line]Wow. So this is former Chief Arima's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop saying 「former.」[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Trying to escape reality, are we?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it. The way you talk is too harsh, Kaori. Just like when you're on TV.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what the viewers want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So save it for the TV. I don't want to hear it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]All right. I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's bizarrely understanding, which only makes this more difficult⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. Now then. You know whose office this is, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, of course.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm. Looks like you've been here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure have. It's Ayumi's office, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you're half right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This is also Toyotomi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, it looks like you really didn't know. Why did you think there were two computers and desks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought Ayumi used both of them⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What we're searching for should be here somewhere. Let's look together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you mean, why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you acting this way?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't know what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's in this for you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ouch, that hurts. Do you think I'm the kind of girl who only works for profit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. You're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you won't tell me why.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry dear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, whatever. It looks like our interests are aligned for now, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Uh-huh⋯ Why do you think that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tonight⋯ Well, overall, I guess it wasn't that long ago. I saw you and Toyotomi talking.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ah, that was sloppy on my end. I have to be more careful. So what about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't act like you cared very much for Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I have to say it, I guess that's your reason.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm. You're pretty sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think her tone of voice changed⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. It's almost like I'm looking at the late Dr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]He was sharp. Always got straight to the point with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Looks like you have a good head on your shoulders, too. And you're clever to boot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So yes, as long as our interests are aligned, it's fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh. This is just meant to draw me in, right?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe⋯ Hahahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Dummy. Young guys like you shouldn't worry so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now start searching. I'm certain it's in this room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I have my own business to attend to. I'll be in the other room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She went to the other room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, no matter what Kaori's planning⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I need now is proof of Ayumi's innocence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I can find it in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came all the way here. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanted to meet that bastard Toyotomi, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, this is the second time I've been here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I once brought Ayumi's briefcase here for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said something about how she couldn't go to a meeting without it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to wait here for Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd like to talk to her. Actually, I feel like I have to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Wait.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that a voice?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Hold on⋯ I⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯where did it come from?[%p]
