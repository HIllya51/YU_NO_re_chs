[name]Takuya[line]It was a call for Ayumi, not me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm happy and sad at the same time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a quiet corridor. Most of the students already went home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Silent corridors inside the school are actually kinda creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up goes to the roof, down leads to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't stare at stairs, you use them to go up or down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an emergency exit sticker here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can get outside the school from here, using this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not an emergency right now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should use the stairs instead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That door in front leads to the history research laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is meeting with some people right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should get moving instead of looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, go up to the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be all done here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, I do not have to go there anymore.[%p]
