[name]Takuya[line]There's only one path, so I don't think we'll get lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing more important than being careful as we proceed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, let's try to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone already pushed the button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a button. It's made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Press the button
Don't press the button
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Did you hear something just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It sounded far away.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It sounded like something really heavy hit the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got a bad feeling about this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](However, there's no way to check what happened.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. There's probably no need to push this right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ What is this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks just like a button. It's a protrusion that's definitely meant to be pressed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Looks like it's made of stone. Is it man-made?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, does that mean this endless hole is man-made?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder if that's the case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Look at this button. Are you going to leave it be or what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be careful. There's no telling what might happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I see that.[%p]
Press the button
Don't press the button
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Did you hear something just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It sounded far away.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It sounded like something really heavy hit the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got a bad feeling about this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](However, there's no way to check what happened.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. There's probably no need to push this right now.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay. Let's just leave it as is for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just how long does it go on?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't think it's going to take us all the way to the bottom of the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's damp, but I don't see any moss growing on it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Let's head back.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll head for the exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on. I can't use that now.[%p]
