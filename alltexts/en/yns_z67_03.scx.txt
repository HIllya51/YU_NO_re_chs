[name]Takuya[line]It's the desert at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I talk to Amanda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda is Illia's younger sister⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not very laughable, I'll say that much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda looks like she's going to explode.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk, tsk, tsk.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sister⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't get the joke⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just cry. You'll feel better.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]D-Don't look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll sock you if you look at my face![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry⋯ I'll close my eyes.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I put my hands over my ears, too?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gag*[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sister⋯ Illia⋯ I hate you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]D-Don't look. If you look at me, I'll knock you out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not looking.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*hic⋯hic* Sister⋯ My sister![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Please⋯just let me rest my head on your chest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*hic* Sister⋯ahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a flood of tears.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Watering my chest with her hot tears.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Endlessly⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda⋯)[%p]
It didn't take long for us to hold each other and start kissing.[%p]
Our lips met over and over as if to fill the voids in each other's hearts.[%p]
Amanda was shivering like a puppy that's been thrown into a freezing river. Her face was wet with tears as her body shook.[%p]
As she whispered for her sister, a big tear drop shined in the corner of her eye.[%p]
She let out a faint gasp as I kissed away her tears.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What⋯ It's not fair for you to be nice only at a time like this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Trying to act tough when you're shaking in my arms is kind-of stupid.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay now. I think Illia was happy.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. At the very least, I think she died satisfied, knowing she'd fulfilled her duty.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, don't cry so much.[%p]
I gently wipe away the water collecting in the corner of her eye.[%p]
I kissed her lips ever so gently.[%p]
Right there in front of me, there was a young lady with her eyes closed, her body shivering.[%p]
I felt like she'd die of the cold loneliness if no one held her.[%p]
So, I held her in my arms with all the love I had. Gently, but firmly, not letting her go anywhere.[%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh⋯ Takuya, you're so sweet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay now. You're not alone.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]O-Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the very least, you have me here. No need to be lonely.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Mm⋯ Takuya⋯ Oh, Takuya.[%p]
Why does the warmth of another person make one feel so safe?[%p]
As I made Amanda feel safer, I found myself feeling better as well.[%p]
Amanda's so cute⋯trusting me completely⋯only wanting to feel some comfort⋯[%p]
I couldn't help but hold her tightly in my arms.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh⋯ Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heheheh, you're so cute I just want to tease you a little.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Y-You dummy![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're beautiful. I'd never have thought there was another side to your personality⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I-Idiot⋯ Who would say that to a girl?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk. Come on, I finally gave you a compliment.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hrmph.[%p]
Just when I thought she was going to hit me, Amanda wrapped her arms around me and hugged me tighter than ever before.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Idiot⋯ What kind of compliment is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Please, Takuya⋯ Hold my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
So we did. She didn't grab my hand, though. Our fingers interlaced, our palms resting against each other's.[%p]
Amanda squeezed my hand so hard it nearly hurt.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯ Please⋯ Don't let go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't, I promise.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I don't⋯ I don't want to be alone again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯ I can't take it anymore! Being alone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. I know, Amanda.[%p]
I held her tightly in my arms. I heard a gasp come out of her mouth.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*hic* I⋯can't⋯anymore⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Unngghh⋯ No⋯*hic*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. Amanda. It's okay now. I'll always be with you. I'm not going anywhere.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Waahhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
I remember her lips⋯[%p]
There were no tears in her eyes anymore. She was free from the loneliness and filled with relief.[%p]
Our lips met once more⋯and then, she held me tighter than I'd ever been held.[%p]
Slowly, I gave in to the heat of the moment⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda isn't in the mood to talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like she'll explode with sadness any minute.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Will you tell me more about Sis?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I didn't know her for very long.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We were only together for two or three days.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Did she tell you something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like⋯what?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Like, something about me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She did, actually.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wh-What did she say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Now, this sister of mine is boorish and unkempt, but her breasts are just humongous.」[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Pfft![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really. I just don't like it when things get too heavy.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the truth.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't apologize.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's all right.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This is no good, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I never cared about my Sis. But when I heard that she was gone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It felt like I'd been stabbed in the heart by something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that's a pretty normal reaction to have.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That's what I'm saying is so bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would it be bad?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Because, you know⋯ I'm taking the initiative and leading the resistance for everyone. Now here I am, getting caught up in my own emotions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]My sister was strict and never accommodating, but she was kind to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ugh, I'm so⋯useless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you say that?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If the resistance can be thwarted by emotion, it's all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I say something?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Go ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Revolutions are based on emotions. There's not a single person alive that can go through everything with just logic.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides⋯ Tears, especially those shed for family, aren't something to be embarrassed about.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]D-Don't say that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I feel like I can rip out whatever's stopping my heart![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The levee's about to break![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But if I really let loose⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know how you feel.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Do you?! My sister⋯ Illia⋯ She was the only one who was ever nice to me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was amazing.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Illia⋯ Sis⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda⋯)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If you keep going straight, you'll head right onto sacred ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sacred ground?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah, that's where you can find the temple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been there before⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You can't be so sure. There are temples built all around the Imperial Capital, just like a border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So there's more than one temple⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could they be for?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The God-Monarch says they're necessary for the ritual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I think it's some kind of distraction to hold off the resistance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like a red herring.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes⋯ I'm sure it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, it might not be⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We should get going soon.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Okay, in a little bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda⋯ What happened?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems so depressed all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia is probably on her mind still⋯)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Did that knight Illia have silver hair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhh⋯ I don't really remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might have⋯ It was four years ago.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you ask?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What happened to that knight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She died.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She's dead⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ She took a huge hit from some giant monster and that was it for her.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That knight was my Big Sis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your sister? Illia?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey! Don't freak out on me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But Illia can't be your⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Illia[line]((I have⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yes⋯))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((I have⋯a younger sister. Just one.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I see⋯))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((We live completely opposite lives. She says there is no God.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Uh-huh.))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((She says the God-Monarch should be removed from the government, she desires for the people to have control of their own lives.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((She wants a democracy.))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((I wonder what she is doing now. She never left my side when she was little⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((I wish⋯ I wish I could see her. Just one last time⋯))[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see. Illia said that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, she said she wanted to see you again.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Looks like you took care of my Sis for a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I wouldn't say I took care of her. All I did was dig her grave and give her a proper burial.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*sniff⋯sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, what are you smelling me for?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well⋯ I was wondering if you smelled like her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]So, she's gone now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I probably shouldn't say this, but she was pretty stiff and serious, wasn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't know her for that long, but she seemed like the serious type.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, she did choose to be a knight even in this day and age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was very skilled with her sword. She took down a giant monster in one swing.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I know she was good⋯ She was serious about her swordsmanship, just like everything else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was very beautiful, too.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Psh, I bet you think she was more of a lady than I'll ever be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I meant.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Did you⋯sleep with her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh, so you didn't⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you even ask that?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sis⋯was never really interested in men.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really⋯ That's too bad.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I thought for a minute you might be a good guy for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm honored. She's gone now, so there's nothing I can do about that⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah⋯now that she's gone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She always said she'd give herself to the Imperial Capital and the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She never should've become a knight. I tried to stop her so many times.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Anything for the God-Monarch⋯ How stupid is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What did they ever do for her? They sent her to defend the Border and left her to die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sis⋯you're so, so stupid![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you don't have to say that![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She was my only family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]And she just went and died![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you⋯crying?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Shut up! I'd never cry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll take her word for it, I guess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She can be pretty cute sometimes, actually.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she'd deny it to no end if I told her that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I should change the subject.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What happened after that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living example of what a knight should be, she slew the giant monster in one swing. At that point, I was pretty useless⋯ I couldn't help her⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wow⋯ So, it's true that knights really do protect the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apparently, yeah.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Even the God-Monarch isn't all bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Illia was wounded⋯she fell ill from her injuries.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wait a second![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's the name?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'm Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No! The name of the knight![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with you all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with her all of a sudden?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's hard to believe everything you went through, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Though I'm still not sure if I believe you came from outside the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wouldn't blame you for not believing me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I wonder what exists beyond the Border⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No one in the Imperial Capital knows. Aside from the rumors that an enemy country lies just on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]An enemy country that no one has ever seen before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if there are any enemies out there, but there are monsters.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The Border is filled with monsters sent over by our country's enemies, or so the stories go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those monsters are sent to the Border by the country's enemies⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia said the same thing before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what are you looking at?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shouldn't you be paying attention to Amanda right now?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Even if it's fake peace, it's better than nothing.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, quit looking all around.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Let's finish talking.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It feels so nice to be warm by the fire in a freezing desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at the fire so sadly⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her shoulders are shivering. It looks like she'll start crying any second.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Illia⋯ My sister⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Staring at me won't do you any good.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hrmph⋯ I bet you look at all the girls like that![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I can tell⋯damn.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Huh? Why am I so upset? Can't you tell?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wh-What are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Flattery doesn't work on me, buddy.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What? You're not going to flatter me?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This is too complicated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The fire is doing its own thing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like it's completely unaware of our situation.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, you'll get burned if you get too close.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's so warm.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The desert gets fatally frigid at night. You can't survive without some warmth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I be looking there right now?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey⋯ Are you looking at my wound?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Geez⋯ Men.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I think it's okay now.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you staring down there for?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hm? How's my wound?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh⋯thanks, Takuya. I'm all right.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I think it was thanks to your first aid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An iron ring⋯ It probably holds some history about the resistance.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like it's shaking a little.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm not going to give it to you.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What? You don't want it?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Tsk⋯ I don't know how I feel about that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I guess I could take it off⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But, I'm not planning on doing so.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This iron ring is my pride. It represents my resistance to the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]How long have I had this? I've forgotten already.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]They must've put it on me when I was imprisoned somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, where are you going?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Going to leave Amanda by herself, are you?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No point trying to rush things.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Calm down. We're right under the nose of the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You've been so uneasy, Takuya. What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Is it your daughter?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She's okay⋯ I'm sure she's fine.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What? Nature's calling?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh, dammit! Hurry up and get it over with![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You don't need to go anymore?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're so weird. Seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Quit joking around. I'm too young to be cremated.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You'll get burned.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You should stop.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]H-Hey, hey![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*sigh* I take my eyes off of you for one second and you're getting into trouble.[%p]
