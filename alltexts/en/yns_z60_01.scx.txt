[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior is way different from what you'd expect⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like everything is made of glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ Let's look around a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are two pillars in the front. This looks like glasswork, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls look very hard. There's also some kind of simple chandelier hanging down from the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And there in front⋯ What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like everything is made of glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be the temple Sala told us about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pillars can't talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The scream came from there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This pillar is hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold. I wonder if it's also this cold during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard⋯and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this some kind of glass?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems to be giving off some kind of pale light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there a voice coming from the walls?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Try to think a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is so smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nice and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the very least, that means polishing techniques exist here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way I could have heard that from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard something from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hexagonal pillar is sticking out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, they have the technology to make something like that in this world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's surprising.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I always got the idea that the people of Dela Grante lived close to nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hexagonal pillar is sticking out of the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hexagonal pillar. Things won't be looking good if it falls on my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, leave that for later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that scream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ Time to move some of these crumbled bits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see what's buried beneath it.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Aaaaahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could that scream have been⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like it's getting colder as I go toward the center.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This spot is way colder than anywhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must've been something here, but what was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all broken. I can't tell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like something was here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all crumbled though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, could this have been from the earthquake?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like something was over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it! It came from outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that voice⋯ Yu-No?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should go outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't we look around a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second, I just got in here.[%p]
