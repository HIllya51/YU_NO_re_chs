[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? No one's answering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, come to think of it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like running water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's the bathroom. She must be running a bath.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in the bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear noise coming from there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's silhouette is easy to see in the bathtub.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure Ayumi's in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she's not moving. Is she crying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, just listen to me for a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can imagine how shocked you must be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I just want you to listen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I shouldn't say it, but that guy's no better than a rabid dog attacking you. No. He's even worse than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi doesn't deserve consideration from anyone, not even you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know we haven't really talked since my old man died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But somehow, I can't help coming back to one thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the first time you've ever hit me, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And somehow, it reinforced that bond we have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you think so? You've never gotten this mad at me before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, you shouldn't have hit me, but it did bring me to my senses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's strange. There's no answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And she hasn't moved one bit since I got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the color of her silhouette through the glass matches her jacket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi wearing her clothes in the bath tub?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are you doing, Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a light. It's not Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtains are a nice color.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like Ayumi is hiding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard can be so traditional about the strangest things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some kind of video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a family picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's in the picture too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the TV won't make Ayumi suddenly appear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should keep looking for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi always sits on these⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair I can use to sit at the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plates and bowls for food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd love to be drinking with Ayumi, just the two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry up and find her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong with this calendar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is some kind of ethnic thing my old man brought home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi really liked this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living room light isn't exactly dim, so I guess this is just for design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong with this plant?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stairs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hardwood floor. It's nice and cool on my bare feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no time for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cordless handset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would be a lot easier if I could just call her with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt she's hiding behind this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the use of standing in the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the living room won't do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around the house some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing? I came here to see Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure she's in the house somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wasn't in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll check one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's in my room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nobody around. It's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've already checked there. I don't need to keep going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wasn't in the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the study?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, are you in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wasn't in the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure nothing's changed between now and the last time I checked there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not in the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe in Ayumi's room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it. Maybe she's resting in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, I'm coming in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she be?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not in the room.[%p]
