[name]Eriko[line]That's a bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's up with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my old man's.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, it does say Koudai Arima on it. What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should tell Ms. Eriko.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She already asked me about it at the caf⑮ anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now is as good a time as any to tell her.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay, it's decided. Ten o'clock tonight. I'm coming with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I promised it would just be the two of us.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It won't be a problem if we don't get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not something I'd expect to hear a teacher say.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm just stating the facts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let me ask you one thing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you bringing to the table, Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you wonder about Houjou?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, I guess I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you aren't going to tell me why.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You haven't told me everything either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We have common interests, and we're acquainted. We're just helping each other out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you going to do with this bankbook?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine for now. Leave it there. It's safe with you, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's still some time until ten o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I still have a little business to take care of. Shall we go together?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Another walk?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell is Ms. Eriko doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's always walking around this area.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There is still about an hour until it's time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why don't we meet in front of the school infirmary before ten?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mind, but⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then I'll be right back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko left toward the old samurai house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But first, what about that guy with the detective⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Houjou?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No. I'm curious about Houjou's employer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The one who had him investigate my old man.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, exactly⋯ He and I seem to be interested in the same things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He could be the one that was following me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone was following you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's nothing. Forget I mentioned it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't think too much about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that's so strange.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got a really solid analysis.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you sound so surprised by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not! It's just⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, nothing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So you were meeting this Houjou or whoever at ten o'clock at Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but I don't plan on going anymore.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, that Houjou guy just wants to make a deal. He won't be interested if I show up empty-handed.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, is that all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know anything about Kanna, so I'm not in a position to exchange information.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't need to spill everything you know. Make him talk first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Bluffing is a great way of negotiating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are such an amazing teacher.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You won't need to reason with Houjou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Seems like he's just planning to use you, so you should turn that around on him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What Ms. Eriko's saying makes sense.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would someone investigate my old man?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And why does Houjou's employer think the old bastard is still alive?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I suppose it's worth it if I could find out that much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now we can move on to the next topic. Let's talk about Ms. Hatano's picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may not believe it, but if it's not a fake, that picture is at least⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Fifty years old.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you don't believe it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, you're lying.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't get it. Are you bothered that I believe you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think about it logically. How could she be decades old? She's not a tortoise or something.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What about you personally?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me personally?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah. What do you personally think of Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I think of Kanna?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't explain it well, but every time I look at her, I get a weird feeling.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So you feel strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's really unusual.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Like love?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I don't think that's it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heehee, I guess you're too young to consider it love right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make fun of me. You know I'm not some kid.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hahaha! Just teasing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, please.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]All right then. What do you think of that picture?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. I mean, I'm sure that picture was taken at least fifty years ago.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And that's a picture of Kanna Hatano. Or it's someone who looks a lot like her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, I say that, but I don't believe it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What evidence do you have?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't be so touchy. Think of it this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school physician and your advisor. Trust between students and teachers is crucial.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, enough of that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just let me finish. Whether I believe you or not doesn't make it true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I believe you. But I would like to work with you to find the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you want to untangle this mess together?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's a terrible way to look at it. Let's consider it a fact-finding mission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course, that doesn't mean I think she's looked the same for fifty years. But there's definitely something weird going on. Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The fact that she keeps transferring schools is one of many mysterious things about her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. There's something weird going on with Kanna Hatano.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know that much.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know why your old man took it upon himself to be her guardian. But it's a possibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You look unsatisfied.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really. You don't know my old man, Ms. Eriko. He's a real bastard.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I thought you were a pretty good family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's what you'd hear if you ask around.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, look at it from another angle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That investigator, Houjou, is interested in Ms. Hatano specifically because she accepted Dr. Arima's protection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's true.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know why, but that investigator is looking for Dr. Koudai Arima. And maybe his ward, Ms. Hatano, knows where he is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would Kanna know where my old man is?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Probably because she was his ward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think he might have told Kanna where he was going?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's a strange way to say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You said that like your father's still alive somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, that might be the case. But of course the way I said it sounded weird to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](As far as the rest of the world is concerned, that old bastard is dead.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But that single letter made me believe he might still be alive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And I do believe it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's entirely possible he's still alive somewhere.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's the matter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just the worries of youth, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Come on. You can tell me what's wrong. Just think of me like a big sister.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Funny words coming from an old lady.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't insult me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then. Young lady?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't be stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay. I'll tell you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, you mean you've decided to tell me all about your sex life?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be an idiot![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heehee⋯ Now you're feeling better, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh, I'm no match for your wiles, am I, Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's one advantage to being older. Okay, what have you got for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right, I'll tell her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can tell her about that investigator, about Kanna⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯the bankbook, and that picture⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough* What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry. I get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There are three things you want to ask me about. There's the bankbook, Ms. Hatano, and the investigator that's after her. Let's do one at a time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I'll start with my father.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You mean your father's bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right⋯ There are two possibilities with that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shall I list them out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go ahead. I'm sure one of them is correct. Or they're both totally wrong.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's possible Ms. Hatano is your father's illegitimate child.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That would mean you and Ms. Hatano are brother and sister.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well that's actually better than the other possibility.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course you'd say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't put it past him to have a college student as a mistress. The things he's capable of are scary.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This is purely based on the fact that Ms. Hatano had the bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something else?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can come up with another possibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Some other reason she might have accepted Dr. Arima's guardianship.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guardianship?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, it's possible your father is Ms. Hatano's guardian.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! Why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know that yet. I'm just brainstorming. It's a theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as we're brainstorming, you might also say Kanna is from a different dimension, and she's hundreds of years old.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell how serious she is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sure seem to love people watching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is hidden by her hair, as usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be looking at her chest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to talk to Ms. Eriko now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be focusing on her clothes right now.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You do look more official when you wear that coat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, I've never seen a doctor wear clothes as form-fitting as those.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even her bangs are long, so long I can hardly see her eyes. She tied the rest back and threw it over her shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong with your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets as always.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
