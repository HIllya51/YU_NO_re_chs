[name]Takuya[line]Not in the downtown area?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived downtown, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I be going the opposite direction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This city's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what are you doing? Geez![%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know where my house is, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think I've been there before.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have to go through the Heights. Okay? Okay, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where the caf⑮ is, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get that book titled 「Legacy」 as soon as possible![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can go to the front to get back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big bank in Sakaimachi. It's called Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's closed now. If I come back during the day, I might be able to go inside.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you need to borrow any money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A Saikyou staff member will come out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting tired of doing stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Just one more time.[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi. A salesperson?[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]I'm Suzuki of Saikyou. Nice to meet you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Suzuki of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, Suzuki may be the strongest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go in one more time?[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]Hi. Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi.[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]I am the receptionist for Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go inside for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]Hi. Welcome. Welcome to Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi. Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]I'm the branch manager of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The branch manager of Saikyou. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does the sign say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Bring your money in right away!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Powerful staff are waiting for you.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Saikyou Bank?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In such a big city, it's not surprising that there are a couple of banks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tree-lined street in front of me leads to the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the tree-lined street downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The look of the city changes considerably between spring, summer, fall, and winter. It's a nice view.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's right. I wonder if there's even a single ray of hope in that crowd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you are a surprisingly profound individual.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean 「surprisingly」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boutique. I don't need anything from this shop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a boutique in this building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi buys clothes at this store fairly often.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I visit that shop a lot too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are various buildings lined up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a long row of buildings downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area is mainly shops and offices, and the residential area is to the left.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is a signboard that stands out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coffee shop itself is quite large and relaxing, so it's perfect for meetings and killing time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big, bright sign.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the sign for the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just left there. Let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's evening, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you have feelings?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's bright lights make it impossible to see the stars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I look like a lunatic staring up at the sky all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky stretches on forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the building won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If you know it, let's go now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, let's go back home.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house isn't this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to give this book to Mio as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I should get back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I should go to school and the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, here I go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go up to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care much though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's the right way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Mio's house is just past the Heights.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, let's go. I'll show you the document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That road leads up to the Heights. It's got a great view of the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a few parks where men and women like to hook up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do at the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go, I want to go with a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do at the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think there's somewhere I need to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do at the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I can do that when I see Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could never say it in front of her.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hotel.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a joke⋯ Would you quit glaring at me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sometimes your jokes aren't really jokes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go, I want to go with a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go there. I can sleep at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As the name implies, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's late already. It seems like it's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I want to visit that caf⑮, I'll have to come back in the evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As the name implies, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means it's closed right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll check inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks the same as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't find anyone specific.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you going to the Evening Caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, didn't you just leave that caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's probably tired of waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go inside the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you having fun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go get the book, or she'll go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. This is the last time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't get that book yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I didn't get that book yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
