[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was supposed to meet Yuuki here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why was Mio's bag at the shrine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care if Mio was just going on a trip or doing research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand why that bag was left there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki really is late.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No luck.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Where would Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not in the city. I checked every shop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go look somewhere else![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, where would I go if I were Mio?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already really dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Yuuki searching?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, look at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is refreshing, but I'm just feeling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss⋯ Man⋯*pant⋯huff⋯wheeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a deep breath.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*inhale*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Haaah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How's that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whew⋯ I'm tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were looking for me?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, I was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you so out of breath?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I ran all the way from the house down there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house down there? You mean that one?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, I ran from Miss Mio's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, so you're getting invited to her house now?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh heh. It's more like I show up uninvited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what's the big deal?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's Miss Mio. I just stopped by her house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio's house is really big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it is⋯ Her father is a prominent person in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not talking about that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about, then?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Not the house, her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure that's just as big.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, yes.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But anyway![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio⋯ She's gone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me everything you know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be evening soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's like Toyotomi said, just a misunderstanding?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I know that was Toyotomi with those yakuza.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't have any proof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night in the park⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to talk to Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Ayumi relies on that Toyotomi guy, but I can't trust him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night in the park⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Aaaaahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that a scream? Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did it come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already nine o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That Kaori lady said I can see her if I turn on the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they went into Meiunji Park down there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That place is a popular date spot at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So if Toyotomi went in there with two other men⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The three of them were about to get kinky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't expect him to swing that way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The atmosphere feels almost stuffy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio and I are just walking along not saying a word.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We made it downtown while I was thinking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You can buy anything from tissues to nuclear warheads in the shopping district.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not true, of course, but there is a lot to buy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* Mio is walking ahead. She won't even look at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet she's still mad⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, she'd be crazy if she wasn't mad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was total pandemonium.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm surprised I wasn't killed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's walking ahead without looking back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She'd probably keep going if I stopped here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That might be funny. I'll stop for a second.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯ S-Sorry, I wasn't looking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]No, it was my fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, have we met before?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]No, we haven't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Sorry, I'm in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh, that woman just now⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph! I guess you like them like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're practically drooling. Looks like you still prefer older women.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't say it like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You said you'd walk me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll walk with you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So what about that woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We just bumped into each other. I was just apologizing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You let me walk by myself. That's not nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were the one walking so far ahead.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This is as far as you need to walk me. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Mio mad at me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I did was glance at that woman wearing skin-tight clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, sure, I noticed her thighs and cleavage⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's basic male instinct to be excited by a woman's voluptuous breasts and hips.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a genetic imperative. Without it, the human race would go extinct.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means that what I felt was a normal urge, extremely necessary for the continuation of all of humanity⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I even talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Guess I'll go home.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Watch where you're walking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did it again. I keep bumping into people here. Huh?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]Hey, Toyotomi. What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]Let's go somewhere we can talk.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]A-All right, I'm coming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was Toyotomi so frazzled about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And he wasn't alone. He had what looked like two yakuza with him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is a picture of Ayumi on the ground here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Toyotomi dropped it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would that asshole have a picture of Ayumi with him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they went toward the Heights. I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll follow 'em⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did they go⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
