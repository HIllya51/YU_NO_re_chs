[name]Takuya[line]The exit is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We still haven't found her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, we should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is all wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's mostly rock, not soil.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The floor is slippery⋯ I should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like the water is seeping up from the ground though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Brr⋯that's cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dripping down from above.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is it seawater?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's give it a taste? It's not salty.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be a groundwater source.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is pretty damp.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If I'm not careful, I'll end up kissing the ground with my ass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, what's with that creepy smile?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like water is seeping out little by little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be seawater. It's not salty.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Fine. Don't come to me when you get dysentery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's moist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be pretty hard to use machinery to dig out this tunnel.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So you're saying it's natural?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can really call natural.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It reeks of human involvement.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Who could have done this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way to be sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'll keep moving ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I think it's about time we moved on.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around a bit more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you thinking of moving on before getting a good look around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around a bit more.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmph. You're so diligent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you know. It's better to be overly thorough in situations like this.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The exit should still be blocked by a rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just checking one last time.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just head back for now.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, let's go back then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ Go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But we just got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
