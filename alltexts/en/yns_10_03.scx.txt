[name]Takuya[line](Yuuki is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll try talking a little more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's your trademark, huh, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always have it on.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's right. I always have it on, whether I'm eating, sleeping, or in the shower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Such a weirdo.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But Miss Mio seems like she's always got her guard up. She never gets in that kind of mood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh, so you're just the wolf in sheep's clothing when you walk her home?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How can I put it in words? The mood never arises? No⋯it's like she makes sure the mood never arises.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Figures.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She talks to me a lot, and she's very nice, always smiling when she speaks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's way different for me. You're maintaining a pretty good position.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「I want us to get in the mood.」[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, it's funny just thinking about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't make fun of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you just go for it and ask her out for tea?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Tea?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a pretty good place downtown.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But⋯do you really think Miss Mio would go out with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just have to take your shot. If it doesn't work out, then we'll think again.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh shoot⋯ Remedial classes are starting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, have fun sitting in for me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh well. Will you buy me dinner or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yep, sounds good.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Yuuki is really into that girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not a bad guy, but I feel like that one in particular is a bit too much for him to take on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm surprised to hear that Mio's interested in the accident at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure she's researching something again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, what should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you were shooting your mouth off to Ms. Eriko again, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I only said the tiniest little thing about sitting in for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tiny or infinitesimal, if you said anything it's all the same.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I-I apologize⋯ Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you apologizing? You didn't do anything wrong.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, then I guess I should tell other people, too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why are you giving me that scary look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And she asked you about that curse, didn't she?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes⋯ She seemed very interested in the story. Do I really look like someone who likes gossip?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You do.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aww. Don't make assertions like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are women like that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You mean like, Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Always wanting to stick their noses into things.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I think that's one of her better features. After all, that's mostly why we started going out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! You're going out with Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, we always walk home together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're making me confused.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But it looks like Miss Mio is more interested in the accident at the coastline than she is in the curse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean that lightning strike?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I like the curse more because it's scary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I can see your ulterior motives. Curse, scary, eek, hold me. That's the situation you're hoping for.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're way too easy to read.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That reminds me, Takuya⋯ Do you know where Miss Mio is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I thought you were just with her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I was. Until a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It seems she went home as soon as the last class ended.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, in her case, she's attending voluntarily. So it's not really a problem.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's a huge problem. There's still one more period of remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So⋯ What am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's obvious.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh maaannn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯ You're the one who said you wanted to take the classes, so I reluctantly gave up my seat.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay, I feel bad so I'm giving your seat back. No wait, I'm only joking, please don't look so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a calculating one. I see how you act the moment Mio's gone.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well of course I⋯ W-Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Mio quit going to remedial classes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why the serious little princess would quit so suddenly.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]My-My, you certainly are a busy man, aren't you Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound different every time you talk to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]N-Now hold on, the way we speak is ultimately a question of mentality, so it changes depending on how I feel each day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it. That's enough.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh heh, so, how far?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean how far?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You know, how far did you get with that girl?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ouchie. That's not nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is nothing impure happening between Kanna and I. Always pure and beautiful. That's my motto.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]More and more beautiful is my motto. Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What's with the long face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's killing me.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You said Kanna. Do you mean Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know her? Mio would be mad to find out you're paying attention to another girl.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Th-That's not it. It's uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why's he being so evasive?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, it's just that I've heard some unsavory rumors about a student called Kanna Hatano and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unsavory rumors?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, it's nothing. They're just silly rumors.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Glaring at Yuuki won't help anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to him.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't glare at me like that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You're making me embarrassed.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That hurts.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am Yuuki, at my master's service.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that about?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No matter how much you order me, Mr. Takuya, I will not give you ten yen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will not give you what's in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's in your pocket?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ten yen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't need it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't grip me like that. *blush*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh no, it was just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Enough of this guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called a hoodie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A jacket with a hood on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the only jacket you have, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Didn't I tell you before? I have many of them in the same color and style.[%p]
