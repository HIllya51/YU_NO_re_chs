[name]Takuya[line]There's not even the tiniest sound in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where should I look for Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. Phew! This school is pretty big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to check anywhere else in here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to look in places Mio's likely to go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm, somewhere Shimazu goes⋯ Maybe the bathroom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Everybody has to go there eventually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll leave checking the bathroom to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll do that. If I find Shimazu in the bathroom⋯ Oh, look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Where?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found it in the lab. They're the reference books I lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is really important to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Great.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can tell you're very happy for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? I can't help it.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Phew! Shimazu is a pain in the ass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is being a pain in the ass just part of the princess package?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't boys think that kind of thing is cute?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. That's pretty harsh coming from you.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't freak me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dark.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't find her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How about Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He might find her downtown.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, then let's meet at the school gate in a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She's not in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What about you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm⋯ I'll search in and around the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not even the tiniest sound in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where should I look for Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nobody in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Good timing. I saw Shimazu.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio? Where did you see her?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I saw her heading upstairs with a bag about an hour ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? What's wrong with Mio?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Upstairs⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I couldn't really talk to her. I was busy, and I had to get to a meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Now, I have to go to the principal's place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you going to the house where that old samurai and his really old grandmother live?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't say that. But do you know her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup. Is Ryuuzouji home?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know. But I have to pick up some paperwork from the teacher's place and deliver it. As soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Can we go in?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I have the key.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, you have Ryuuzouji's house key.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, don't say it like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, do you remember that tapestry? The one you called a religious painting?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I see that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If all you want to do is look at it, I guess so. Are you sure it's not going to be weird for you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know, with Shimazu⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm going to the principal's home, but if you come with me, I can show you that tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]See you later. If you don't come right away, I'll just leave.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't go there right away, she'll leave.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious about Mio. Didn't she say she had a big bag?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the only one in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah, look at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the only one in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, as usual everyone is just hanging out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are these students doing?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just so you know, I'm not the one who posted that stuff on the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I can't believe Miss Mio is going to study abroad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the story.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I was shocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you tell her how you feel?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No way. I can't do that. Miss Mio is leaving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Can I see that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could it be your fault⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio decided to study abroad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would Yuuki be the reason?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they're both in the same club or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They seem to be talking about their plans.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to clear up any misunderstandings.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to say something.)[%p]
[name]Student[line]((*whisper*))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((That's Mio Shimazu, right?))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((Yes, yes. Isn't her father a gangster or something?))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((No. He's the current mayor. That accident is his fault.))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((Why would she even come to school?))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((There are kids here whose parents died in the accident, right?))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((Maybe she came to apologize to the families and students?))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((That's a good idea. She's normally such a snob, just because she's pretty and rich.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Listen to those idiots gossiping. They just say whatever they want, don't they?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not your fault, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You put justice before personal ties, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid. You don't think I'd do that, do you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, who else could have done it? You're the only one who I talked to about that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah. But⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No excuses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]((She is talking to that Arima, the troublemaker.))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((Like attracts like, I guess.))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((I know she's an honor student, but she only got those grades because of her connections.))[%p]
[name]Student[line]((I'm sure her father helped her out with that.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're saying whatever they feel like.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey assholes, how about–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't worry, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't worry. It's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm an idiot. I shouldn't have trusted you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's like they said. I can't come to this school anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Mio![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no. It's just a misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yuuki⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I heard the conversation between the two of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I expected more from you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't give me excuses. You may not like Miss Mio, but I don't have a problem with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki ran to the second floor after Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. What the hell is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't any more people in front of the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably because they took that poster down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But who did it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Mio is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She just told me she hated me. I can't nod my head to that and walk away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I need to find Mio and then⋯ What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are those people doing in front of the bulletin board?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hall is dark, and there's nobody here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the electronic lock didn't set.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hall is dark, and there's nobody here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main hall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to the center of town. Mio should be waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where I'm going, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry up and get Mio's book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's almost night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial lessons are over, but there are still a lot of students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
