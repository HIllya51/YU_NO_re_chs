[name]Takuya[line](The woman in front of me is named Amanda.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's your turn, Amanda.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]My turn?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you come to this mine?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I didn't come here. I was captured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you do to get captured?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I already told you who I am. My status means I can be captured at any time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does that make you my buddy?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Buddy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. The warden said you were pulling my strings. At least, that's what he believes.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hmm, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should get some rest. And keep my coat on. It's cold.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to sleep.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You wanna sleep with me?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]D-Don't be stupid. I just wanted to apologize for troubling you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Trouble?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]They probably threw you in here because they thought we were working together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And they caught and tortured you. What on earth did you do?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I could tell you, but then you really would be part of this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is Amanda the leader of the resistance?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. Sala said something about that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The resistance⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're the force fighting against the God-Monarch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I joined her, maybe it would get me closer to the God-Monarch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to give it a rest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm better off not getting more involved than I already am.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should keep following my own plan.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And I'll leave others to their plans.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What they're doing has nothing to do with me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so cold.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Three days in here, and I'm still not used to it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are you having trouble too, Yu-No?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm going to help you no matter what.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Until then, well⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]Guuhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Water?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Heh, heh, heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd know that slimy laugh anywhere.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh, heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want, fatso?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I imagine it's tough for you to sleep in that heat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I think this place is growing on me. This warms me up after the cold nights.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Most humans can't even handle one day in here, but you've managed to last three whole days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because seeing your ugly mug every morning keeps me motivated.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I guess I underestimated you. Heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take that as a compliment.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]*huff* How'd you like your night alone with Amanda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you expect me to say? She's got a nice rack?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Jail's not so bad with a woman around, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I supposed to thank you?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You're supposed to tell me what you two talked about![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We introduced ourselves, and then we came to a decision.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]And what decision was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That a fatso like you has enough meat on him to stave off the hunger pangs.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]*twitch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! Aw, I was only telling you the truth.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]*twitch twitch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong? You got a tic or something?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh⋯ I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That I'm a nice guy?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]That you have more resilience and nerves than the average man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]How about I take you sightseeing for a bit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is there to see?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Let's call it a show⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Where's Amanda?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, so you do know her⋯ Heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already told you we introduced ourselves last night.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I'll let you see her. Right this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got a bad feeling about this.)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]What's wrong? Starting to like your new home in this cell?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you scheming?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Look, I'm not forcing you to decide. Heh, heh, heh⋯ Would you like to stay here for a couple more days?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Or would you rather go see Amanda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]First, I'll be tying your hands. I'd be a fool to ignore your strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a jerk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But where's he taking me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if he whips me, I won't let him break me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll make sure he knows that no matter what he does, it's not going to work.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the fuck?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey⋯ Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing to her⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hah⋯what do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's hung her from the ceiling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And he's whipping her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should have known he'd have a torture chamber!)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]It's an interesting show, don't you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Now then, let's begin the questioning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, it's not what you think. You're the one I'll be questioning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me⋯?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I must say, I am pretty smart. Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if you have to say it yourself, then⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]She's a tight-lipped woman who's spent three days stuck in that cell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]So, I discovered what you two have in common.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You're both interested in helping others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doing good for others is overrated. I've already got enough to worry about just trying to take care of myself.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]We'll see about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯ You bastard![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I thought you said you couldn't care less about others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh, heh⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop! What do you want me to say?![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You already know what I want to know. I'm happy to listen anytime you want to start talking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know anything![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Is that so? Heh, heh, heh⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Aaahhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it, you sadistic bastard![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, did you want to say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, I don't know anything![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]*pant pant* Phew⋯ This is good exercise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. He's got this all wrong.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He thinks I'm working with Amanda, but I don't know anything.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hahaha! Hey, fatso![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Who are you talking to?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]We've got nothing to do with each other.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You think I believe you?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*spit*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Ha! Don't make me laugh. Huh![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]We'll continue this later.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Wh-What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This⋯is huge![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Ugh⋯ Guards! Come here and⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Ahhhhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-It's a big one.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Everyone, evacuate now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell?! He just ran off all by himself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The building is collapsing. It's a huge earthquake![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda! I'll help you![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No! Just run! Hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If this keeps up, the whole building will come down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get you out of here before that happens.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't be a fool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't leave you here.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! It won't open![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Go! Please, go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. I'm not going to listen to you right now.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Y-You idiot! This could get us⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost there⋯ Damn, this thing is tough.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Of course it is! If it were easy to open, it wouldn't be a restraint![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no time for this![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Aah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling's coming down![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The whole building's going to collapse!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I know. And the doorway's blocked by rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The building's about to collapse. Hahaha, this is crazy![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You idiot! Just ignore me and get yourself out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! I already got to know you back in that cell. I can't just leave you now.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would be terrible if the building collapsed.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm sorry. It's all my fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Something's coming down from the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From the sky? It must be an angel coming for us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see anything.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Look there! That shadow across the sun![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I seeing things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is that woman coming toward us?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's an adult Nogard![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The adult what?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that⋯ Kun-Kun?![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way! I never thought you could look like this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's reaching out to us. She's here to help![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing? Amanda, come on![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]B-But there are two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry. Hurry up![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]O-Okay![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That building we were in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We barely made it out of there.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]And this Nogard is somehow flying with both of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kun-Kun has some incredible power.[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And she's certainly grown a lot⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey! What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you suddenly so upset?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Humph, I wonder why![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Look! The mine!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the buildings are⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]They're all collapsing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there they go![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The tower, the mine⋯ It's all going down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A total collapse.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]We're lucky we got out of there just in time. We definitely wouldn't have survived that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We would have died?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Can't you tell? You'd have to be immortal to survive that earthquake![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what about all those people in the mine?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't be serious![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Whoa! Calm down, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! Let me go! Hey![%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, let me go![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're talking crazy! If you go down there, you'll die too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to those guys?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't you see what's happening? It's terrifying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There's no way anyone could survive that. They're all buried under the gravel and rocks by now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All those people who were in the mine⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All of them⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't care about that fat bastard or his men.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All those guys who cheered me up and took care of me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're all buried under dirt and rock?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, I know there were some tough guys in there, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There were a lot of jerks I didn't get along with⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But none of them deserved to die like that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All the guys down there are now⋯gone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to hear it.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel horrible right now. Just give me some space, or I might end up hating you.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It seems like it's calming down now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to go back⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you going to do down there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll decide when I get there.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All right. If we can help them, that's what I want to do, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everyone down there opposed the God-Monarch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like Amanda said, if we can help them, we should.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There might be survivors.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there aren't any survivors⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep digging, but all I find are dead bodies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah⋯ This wasn't just a slight tremor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The earthquake destroyed everything⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only survivors are me and⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Any luck, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see any survivors.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see. I'll try to find where that building was standing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The Nogard is resting over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, Kun-Kun needs to rest.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm glad to be doing something useful. It's worth it in the end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll keep searching a little longer.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*smile* You look tough. That's good for the resistance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tell you right now: I don't plan on joining any groups.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The resistance embodies the people's will to fight back. At least, that's what I like to think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There's significance in the very will to improve the current situation⋯to overthrow the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I ask you something?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they caught someone who was really short, say this tall, and couldn't work the mines, where would they take her?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just asking you a question.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I don't know. Someone that small would barely be an adult.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Barely?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't act dumb. You know we mature quickly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what happens⋯next?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Once we're adults? We could stay like that for decades and hardly change at all. It's kind-of strange, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just barely an adult⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They mature very quickly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see. So, it's not just Yu-No. Everyone in this world matures quickly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not just humans⋯ Kun-Kun grew quickly, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So all the people of Dela Grante have a very short childhood and grow into adults quickly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The realities of the Dela Grante are so unusual⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda and Celes are completely different from me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But if we're so different, how could Celes and I have a baby?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does it mean you don't have to be the same type of human to have children?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You got really quiet all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The warden said something to you, didn't he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, that's right.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The priestess needs to do the ceremony, or the world will perish. To do that, she needs a holy coffin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]And to make a sacred coffin, you need the sacred stones.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What I am doing here will help save the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's good.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's all the reason I need. And it's good to keep saying that, because the people who believe the same thing will hear it and come too, just like you did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying most of it was a lie?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Not most of it⋯ All of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you at least tell me why they'd be lying about this stuff?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Let me ask you something. What is the ceremony? Who's ever seen an actual catastrophe? What is a sacred coffin? Is it all really necessary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No one can answer any of those questions, because it's all bullshit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I wish I could answer those questions, but I can't because there aren't any answers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what was the point of all the work being done here?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]To wear people down, so they don't have the energy to resist the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying what they did here was totally useless?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Not useless. It's useful for dividing the resistance and demotivating them. It's useful to the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hrmph. I won't fall for the God-Monarch's trap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't know⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's say you're right. Let's say this mine is useless. But what about the priestess?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The priestess?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the priestess in the Imperial Capital? She really exists.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Really exists⋯? What do you think 「priestess」 even means?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The priestess is⋯ Well, they need her to perform that ceremony⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]And who's ever seen the ceremony?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]A woman they call the priestess exists. So what? She's just some actor they got to back up the God-Monarch's story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]They kill a woman they call the priestess under the pretense of performing a ceremony. The people respect the priestess and trust that the God-Monarch really is performing a ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's so easy for them. All they have to do to maintain the God-Monarch's control is kill one woman every 400 years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, the story about there being a big catastrophe every 400 years is all bullshit?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Think about it logically. The only thing keeping the general public in line is a fear of that catastrophe and the faith that their God-Monarch can deliver them from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You look pale. Don't worry, this happens to everyone who realizes the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's all a lie⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A lie to keep the God-Monarch in power.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But then, what did Celes die for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The God-Monarch's ego?!)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's wrong? You look really serious⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, well why wouldn't I be? We were trapped in a cell not too long ago![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just thinking.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's your purpose?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Purpose?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The reason you invaded the temple. You must have a reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was nothing, really. I was just walking past it by chance, and the guards caught me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you think I'm lying?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Because I don't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got something to say to me? I'm all ears.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ha! You're quite a guy, you know that? I'm not surprised the warden got tired of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You must have done something against the God-Monarch's regime to end up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of people like that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Are you saying you're different, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you. I ended up in the temple by mistake. I got caught.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, since we're sharing, why don't I tell you about myself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want to talk, I can't stop you.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm pretty well known in the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you steal the God-Monarch's favorite slippers?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Close⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I oppose the God-Monarch's regime. I'm involved in the resistance's activities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, you look like a celebrity, I'll give you that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I am not doing it to get famous![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, I don't know where you're from or who you are, but don't you hate the God-Monarch, too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hate?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not hate⋯exactly.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Really⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just say I have a few things I'd like to say to the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I see. So something happened to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could you try not to look so happy when you say that?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sorry. I'm sure there are a lot of dissatisfied people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]And we're all forced to live out our lives in a horrible place doing meaningless work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's meaning to it. The fact that you ended up in a camp for political dissent says a lot about you.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What does it say exactly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought we were here to mine sacred stones for the ceremony.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sacred stones?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The priestess may be missing, but this work still needs to get done.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You actually think this mining is meaningful?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hahaha! That's too funny⋯ I can't believe I met someone who still thinks that's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you at least tell me why?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sorry, I don't mean to laugh at you, but you fell for their lies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I fell for their lies?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just call me Takuya.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why were you put in here, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I kissed the warden, my mistake.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Very funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I heard rumors about you when I got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What rumors?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I heard some idiot trespassed in the temple. It's quite the hot topic among the prisoners.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Look, I've been fighting that jerk right from the start, just like you, and I refuse to let him break me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got it all wrong. I just hate his terrible fashion choices.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I get that a lot.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I saw you from the window of my cell the other day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you see?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You saved that Nogard from the other workers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You mean Kun-Kun?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Kun-Kun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's a very dear friend of mine.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Your dear friend⋯like a girlfriend?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! That animal?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Weirdo, who calls an animal a dear friend in the first place?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's like family to me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope she's okay.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]So, the Nogard was like your pet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯well, more like my friend.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It looked like she's going to start molting soon. After that, she'll be able to fly long distances⋯ If she's alive, then maybe she escaped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Molting?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Once they reach adulthood, they look a lot like us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, and her mother was⋯)
[name]Takuya[line](So when she reaches adulthood, she'll look like her mother?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a major metamorphosis.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And there are all kinds of life forms like that in Dela Grante.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why did you protect her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't want her to die here.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me ask you a question.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you come here?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why don't you ask that ridiculously fat warden with the incredible sense of style?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! Is that what you call him? That assessment is right on the mark.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You treated my wounds⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Thanks, but don't think I owe you one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thought never crossed my mind.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I get that a lot.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's blazing hot during the day and practically freezing at night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda's holding up pretty well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've been here three days now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wouldn't say I'm used to it, but it's not so bad that I'll die.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess once you've been in a place long enough, you get used to it. The human ability to adapt is amazing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's covered in cuts and bruises. She must be really strong.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Do you want to look at my body that badly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's got spunk, too.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's the matter? Never seen a woman's body before?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're wearing pretty light clothing. You're gonna freeze in here. Would you like my shirt?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman with short, fiery-red hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must have amazing strength to have recovered from those terrible injuries so quickly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Bandages are wrapped all around her body.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her body was covered in cuts and bruises.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You did this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just didn't want you to die here. That's all.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's trembling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯ Not too big, not too small⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to stop staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wh-What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the sky.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, we can't get out of here.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You talk to yourself a lot. It's unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That's my chest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ That feels nice.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You are so, so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's been under a lot of stress.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's with you and the ceiling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess we can't escape through the ceiling, either. Then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you doing? Why are you jumping up toward the window?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't escape through the window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wouldn't be so bad if I knew I could get out of here easily.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You talk to yourself a lot.[%p]
