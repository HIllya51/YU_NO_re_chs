[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I come, she's not going to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, it's pitch black.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's the light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew no one was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. How did I end up back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said he was looking for something in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about it. What could he be looking for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki said he was looking for a journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A journal⋯ I remember finding a ripped page from some old journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like they were afraid of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would the journal be in the laboratory? So weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know why I always knock.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in, if anyone's in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, Mitsuki said Ryuuzouji was looking for a journal in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would the journal be in the laboratory? So weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know why I always knock.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in, if anyone's in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, are you in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see anything when the light is off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, she'll come eventually. Might as well wait a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said it was something about Ryuuzouji. I wonder what it could be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, it isn't even evening yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knocking every time makes me feel dumb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as usual.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is someone there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, sorry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I mean, when you make that face, I know I'm in for it, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the heck is Boss Man? Whatever. Hey Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry, I've got to go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You're going to yell at me, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you think I'm angry? Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whoa, your face is twitching! It's terrifying![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]See! I knew I was in for it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just listen to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew no one was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know no one's in here. It's just good manners, I guess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
