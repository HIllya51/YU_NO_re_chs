[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see my whole town from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The moment I heard she was leaving, my chest started to feel tight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, I shouldn't have lost her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I were her, where would I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Heights. You can see the whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see the park down on the left and Kanna's apartment building beyond that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me, I have the anti-fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori isn't here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Didn't I have something to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I got really side-tracked right when I was in the middle of something else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I lost her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure Kaori came this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Look at that park over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whoa! Look at all these lustful couples.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be so cheerful looking down at this park.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Meiunji Park is a hive of lustful young people at this time of night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's a weird woman.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's with that look? You don't look like a passionate youth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because I'm not.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There's nowhere to sit here. How about we lie down together on the ground?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]T-Together? Uhm⋯ I'm fine standing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Standing. Wow. That's romantic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heehee! Then let's do it standing up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting tough.)[%p]
