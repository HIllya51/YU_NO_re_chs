[name]Takuya[line]This is the school infirmary. Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the lights are on. Was someone just here?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. Phew! This school is pretty big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to check anywhere else.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to look in places Mio's likely to go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm, somewhere Mio goes⋯ Maybe the bathroom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Everybody has to go there eventually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll leave checking the bathroom to you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll do that. If I find Mio in the bathroom⋯ Oh, look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Where?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found it in the lab. They're the reference books I lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is really important to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Great.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can tell you're very happy for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? I can't help it.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Phew! Mio is a pain in the ass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is being a pain in the ass just part of the princess package?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't boys think that kind of thing is cute?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. That's pretty harsh coming from you.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't freak me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dark.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't find her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How about Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He might find her downtown.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, then let's meet at the school gate in a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She's not in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What about you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Anyway⋯ I'll search in and around the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the school infirmary. Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the lights are on. Was someone just here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko went for a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where she's walking about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as usual.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaaa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wow, that scared me.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You freaked me out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This is a good cigarette. Wanna hit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just one.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm kidding. Students are forbidden to smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you sound so formal, all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you have time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I want to talk to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it have been?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like she's more out than in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An empty school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she said she won't be back till late at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could she be up to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Didn't she say she wanted to gather her thoughts alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah hah, that's right. Well, then.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, do you just have too much time on your hands?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's just that somehow I end up coming here. Bye.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Such a character.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh⋯you again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah ha ha. Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you don't leave soon, I'll have to activate the electronic lock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ Bye, Abel.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the light is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means, someone was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? The curtain is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's strange. Who's sleeping at this time of day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is never here, is she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Ms. Eriko walking around?[%p]
