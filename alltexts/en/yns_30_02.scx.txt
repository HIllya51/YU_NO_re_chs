[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe that lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that's the case, then force is the only option.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like she's really concentrating.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, if that's the case, then force is the only option.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was back here, I'm sure of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsukiii.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's too deep for me to see very well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on, notice me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I know it was around here somewhere.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, I thought it was here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Maybe it's a little farther in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I knew it, it's Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there something in the well?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's bent over really far and peering into the well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a dark and deep hole.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's dark, and deep to boot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this person doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like a well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could be inside?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's an old mansion, so it's not strange to have a well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The problem is, why is she looking into the well?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know the feeling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this a good time for that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the time to stare at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, this works pretty well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She hasn't noticed me, so I have to make sure she notices me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay. Hey, aren't I always doing the same thing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well.)[%p]
*rustle rustle*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eeek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! A-Am I falling?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Help me![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Th-This is bad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Stop complaining and give me your hand. *grunt*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hurry, take my hand! Here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rim of the well is slippery.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hurry⋯ Come on![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* Oof. Here we go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mm⋯ Mmm! You're heavy, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up and pull or I'll⋯ Whoa![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eek⋯ No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I thought I was gonna die.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This well is pretty deep. It'd be bad if you fell in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say things like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Here, give me your hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff* You saved me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*scoff* Don't scare me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the one who was scared. Don't kick back at me, okay? You're not a donkey.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well⋯ You were doing weird things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You ignored me when I called your name.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I didn't hear you⋯ Sorry. Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm fine. I just almost died.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There you go again. Can you stand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I can⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to stand up and lose the view.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*squeeze*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really want to do that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But there's a more effective way to do it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know it's hard to let that one go.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I think there's a more effective way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really understand the feeling though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this a good time for that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a nice ass⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, this isn't the time to think about that stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really understand the feeling though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this a good time for that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those beautiful bare legs⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to drool over that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are trees and grass growing and rocks on the ground.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means no one's been taking care of this place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I'm more interested with what's in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. It's not the time to use that.)[%p]
