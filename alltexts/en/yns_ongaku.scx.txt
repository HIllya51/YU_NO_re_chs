[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You haven't seen something special in my ending.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's an ending that doesn't appear on the map.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know you can find it, Takuya. Do your best.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hehe, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]

[name]Mio[line]Congratulations, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I always knew you could do it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]By the way, did you see the sweet, happy ending with me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Judging by the look on your face, I guess not⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's a special ending not displayed on the map.[%p]

[name]Kanna[line]Allow me to share something with you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You have yet to see one of my endings.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's an ending that is not recorded on the map. I know you can find it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You saw my ending too?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you very much.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Farewell⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Congratulations, Takuya.[%p]

[name]Mitsuki[line]My story may have been a sad one, but my time with you made me truly happy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's meet again in another parallel world.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hi there![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe, so you cleared 100 percent, did you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Even an industry spy like me must tip my hat at your accomplishments.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I hope to see you again soon.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wait, why are you waving your hand at me?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are you shooing me away?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on, I just wanted to congratulate you⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh, see ya around, Boss Man![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You might be my foe, but you're an admirable guy.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Daaaad![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It looks like there are some endings you still haven't seen yet.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But that's okay; those are just extras.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's an undeniable fact that you cleared 100 percent, Dad.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But once you see the secret endings, you'll become the Yu-No Perfect Master.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You're incredible, Dad. You obtained a 100 percent clear rate, unlocked the Music Room, and saw all the extra endings.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No man has been more deserving of the title Yu-No Perfect Master![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hehe, take some time to listen to the soundtrack and remember me every once in a while.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was unexpected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never thought so many people would be crammed into the Music Room to surprise me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ Okay, time to go into the Music Room.[%p]
