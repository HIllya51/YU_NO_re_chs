[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio was looking for something a few minutes ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is that over there?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here at night?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm looking for something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're looking for something?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]When I find out, I'll let you know. I'm not sure yet, so I can't tell you anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you know I was a fan of your father's?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, kind of.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think I can solve the mystery of that book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Book?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*smirk* Take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Mio looking for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the shrine at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here right now. It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'd better get going before that pest Toyotomi comes by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People call the base of the Sword Cape the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about those guys that came from behind the mountain?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Was that you, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What a coincidence. We were trying to search here.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I apologize.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, this doesn't have anything to do with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes it does. This place is under Geo Technics' management, and if someone I know causes problems here, I'm going to get in trouble, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plus, that annoying guy is going to come around yelling at me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I thank you for the warning. Now let's go, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, all right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]See you around, boss man.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, right away! See you later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like a queen and her steward⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what were they doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shrine. This place is relatively quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shrine at night. That brings back memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. That's a relief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the shrine. No one's here, as usual.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, aren't you Ayumi's Minion A?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Who are you calling a minion? You shouldn't point at people. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is a public place, last I heard. There's no reason for you to ask me that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. You're a cheeky one. This area is under direct supervision of Geo Technics because of the construction expansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, oh really?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't pick your nose in front of other people. Listen here, kid. You can't go near the shrine without my, the construction director's, permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Can I get your permission?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all the same even if I ask you, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No, it's not the same as me saying no and not saying anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the difference?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Me saying no or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy stupid?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, this old shrine is going to be torn down soon anyway. Might as well enjoy it while you can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! You're kidding, right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No, I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is one of our town's most famous locations.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]There's no law against tearing down famous locations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The local residents are going to have something to say about this.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Unfortunately for them, we got permission from the mayor, and we already finished the legal proceedings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯why?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's confidential.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're tearing down this shrine with nothing but the mayor's permission, and you're not telling anyone why?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The mayor acts as the representative for the people of his town. That means the decisions he makes are also the decisions of the people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Man, this guy is just talking nonsense now.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If you have any objections, I suggest you take it to court.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nothing I can say to that. Dammit.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Just don't forget that Chief Arima is an employee of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Make sure you don't do anything scandalous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by 「scandalous」?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]For instance, a family member of an employee joining protests against the company.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯ I see.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't think that'd be good for Chief Arima, nor for you. Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You are the chief's son, so I can't say much more than that. Enjoy your memories of the shrine, but get going once you're done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr, arguing me down with logic like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's right about most of the stuff he says, but I refuse to separate logic from emotions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're going to tear down this shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth has Ayumi gotten herself involved in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet⋯ Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to my old man's letter, if I came here I should be able to meet a certain someone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A certain someone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be the woman who disappeared right before my eyes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Darn. I feel like there could be some kind of clue around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sword Cape. People call this the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say everything started here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My head hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My cheeks, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stings⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi pinching me again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She always pinches me when she's trying to wake me up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold. I wonder why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a bed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, this is where I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? The controller is lighting up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See? It's blinking. You can't be serious![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That scared the crap out of me! What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like something was projected in this space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened to me⋯[%p]
