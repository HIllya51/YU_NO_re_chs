[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, not even Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Back to the small room it is.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How was it? Did you find anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's because you were able to insert the coin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So what should we do? Go forward?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course. Staying here won't do us any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It went out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are we going to do? What are we going to do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to panic. The light just went out. That's all.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You have a point⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be okay. This thing was half broken anyway.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Y-Yeah, sure thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't good. Mitsuki is on the verge of panicking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to get the job done as soon as possible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door made of stone.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If it's a door, that means we can open it, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck is that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Looks like a door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A door? What would a door be doing here?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're asking me? How should I know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A door, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's clearly man-made.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means someone came down here and built it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could its purpose possibly be⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, just what is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My guess is it's an underground passage made with a specific purpose in mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A purpose? Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How should I know?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Could it be an air raid shelter? You know, to run from bombings during the war.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bomb shelter with this much water seeping in?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah⋯ After all these years it started dripping in from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, I've never heard of any air raid shelter with a tunnel this long. If it were bombed in the middle, you'd be cut off from the rest of it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You might be right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this whole thing was dug out by people, it would have taken a long time.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And a lot of man power.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. If it were such a big project, there would have to be some kind of record of it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But there isn't?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. There were talks about destroying Triangle Mountain during and after the war, but I never heard anything about an air raid shelter.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So there's no record of it at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What if it were a military secret during the war?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's possible, but if that were the case, there would be rumors about it throughout Sakaimachi. There are lots of old folk living around here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then what could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that's what Mio was researching. That old bastard might have been researching the same thing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's check it out. We might find something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right.[%p]
