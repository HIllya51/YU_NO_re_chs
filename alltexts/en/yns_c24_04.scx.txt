[name]Takuya[line](There's a security guard there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't look like I can get past.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It's you. If you don't have an appointment–[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh⋯ What is it?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes⋯ Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're talking about something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, I understand calling a wrong number on a cell phone, but I don't get a wrong number on a pager.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Someone calls you, leaves you a message, and then when you call them back, it was a wrong number.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It just sounds like a joke.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes⋯ I understand. Right away then⋯ Yes, as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That's how it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what 「how it is」 means.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It means I'm busy. I don't have time to deal with you, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I have to go now, okay? You can't hang around here too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, doesn't look like I can get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll come back.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It's you.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Do you have an appointment here?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I have to think, depending on your response.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is bad. I could get arrested if this keeps up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I supposed to do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It might be best to leave for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, then⋯ Please send my regards to Ayumi, I mean Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, it's you. You're just hopeless.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That card you have⋯ Where did you get that?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It looks like the ones we use at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Card?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, this. It looks like a security card.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So she's interested in this?)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You again. I don't care if you're the chief's son, I can't make an exception for you.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I won't be lenient if you do it again. Got it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'll get arrested if I do it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Should I go back and try again later?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no problem to just come here, is it?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It is. This is the company's private property. We're under tightened security right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]So do you have some special appointment?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I came here to tell Ayumi about how sketchy that bastard Toyotomi is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's probably not a good excuse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I won't be lenient on you even if you're related to an employee, so be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah⋯ There was an intruder or something last night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe that's why.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]The entrance is electronically locked, so you can't just push through anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An electronic lock, huh.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Unless I unlock it from here, you can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Don't go wandering around here too much. Got it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No good. I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only I had a reason to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is stern, but so is her tone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is tied up in the back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks active, not just because she's a security guard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That neck tie is a little short.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's part of this place's guard uniform.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's an emblem sewn above the right pocket.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it some kind of mark?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's feminine, in a good and bad way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she really qualified to be a guard?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do all security guards where white gloves?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if there's a reason.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Do they take out bad guys with this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like a wireless radio. I guess it's a walkie-talkie.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If you took that off, her pants would fall down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet she'd never guess I was thinking that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A female guard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's smiling, but she has a strict tone.)[%p]
