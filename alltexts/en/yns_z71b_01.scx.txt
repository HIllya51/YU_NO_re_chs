[name]Takuya[line]It's an underground passage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are passageways to the front and to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Following this underground passage should take me to the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The passage goes on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't proceed carefully, I'll lose track of where I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only light. I should use it to proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not even that huge earthquake could cause this place to collapse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, you can never be too careful. So that's just what I'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I should go forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like I can go up the right side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ Are we going back?[%p]
