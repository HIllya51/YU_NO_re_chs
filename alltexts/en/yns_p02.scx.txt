[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry to Sword Cape![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That old bastard might show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is the key to the study?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now where's that package that came for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It should be here on the counter, but it's not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh. The TV was left on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a news show running.[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((⋯is under investigation.))[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((Police are currently questioning employees about the freak lightning strike to ascertain whether the company is at fault.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The accident along the coast. Damn. Just when I thought things were calming down around here, this happens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things must be rough for Ayumi right now.[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((Mayor Shimazu denies any connection between the incident and his administration.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been seeing that newscaster a lot lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be really popular right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's practically celebrity status, like they think her appearance is more important than her intelligence or job competency.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She fits most of the qualifications for a female newscaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She is pretty cute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no. Now I'm staring at her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm watching anyway. I fell for the network's scheme just like everybody else watching this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She is cute though⋯ Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who turned the TV on anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been upstairs this whole time. Someone must have turned it on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't waste electricity. *click*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That should be good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, time for me to find some food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm. Guess I'll start with the refrigerator.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where can I find some food?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((What is it?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Yes. I understand. I'll take appropriate measures.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's coming from Ayumi's room. She must be home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know there's nobody here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's at work, and the old bastard's⋯ Well, I guess he's on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For a second, I expected to see him peeking out from around a corner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how weird he was, there's no way even he could come back from the dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. If he was gonna be weird, he could have at least run with it and been as weird as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
