[name]Takuya[line]The old man's study. There's nothing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that I'd see anything if I opened them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are down⋯ At least they weren't taken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The garbage can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no garbage in it now, so it's just a container.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The cord isn't plugged in, so it won't turn on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lamp isn't a research paper⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess that's what saved it from being taken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man would sit here and work⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know why superior chairs have five legs instead of four?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With only four legs, you risk falling when you lean all the way back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With five legs, it's harder to fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A five-legged, wheeled chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they left nothing in the room⋯except the furniture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's work desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He used to do his research here, buried in books and stacks of papers⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what he was researching, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside. Guess that means it's not a bookshelf⋯just a shelf.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There used to be mountains of books in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's totally clean now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fluorescent light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the light for the room. There's a fluorescent bulb inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just an empty carboard box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me, I feel like there used to be books piled up here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, for the old man, this bookshelf was just a drop in the bucket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He had way more books than this bookshelf could ever hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a wheeled bookshelf.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you slide it open, you'll find some more space for books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The skylight window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The skylight window. It makes it a little brighter in here during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you roll the chair on the flooring panels, the polish will rub off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the floor is still fine⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's completely empty⋯just like everywhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In a way, it's kinda refreshing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Staying in this empty study won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back to the living room.[%p]
