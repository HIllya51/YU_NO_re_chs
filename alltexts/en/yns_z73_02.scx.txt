[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's grown up so much.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's morning. Why are you still here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm here to kill the God-Monarch, but I can't say that to Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's enough to dirty my own hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no need to tell Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing. It's been a long time since it was just the two of us like this. I want to talk to you, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, okay! I have tons of stuff to talk about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, it's only been a few months, but so much has happened. Just let it all out.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, I couldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll keep you up all night talking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Bring it on.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Very well, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I spent almost the whole time listening to Yu-No talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was talking nonstop. She must be exhausted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She still has an enthusiastic personality, but she's certainly become a woman.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Uh, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she's talking in her sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry like that–it won't do you any good in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's about time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch should come here any moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the only time he'll be without a guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They'll walk down that long corridor toward the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't miss that opportunity, or I'll have no chance at all. I'll end up like Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll leave Yu-No here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once I kill the God-Monarch, I'll get Yu-No out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then we can live together somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want her to find a partner, have a family, and live a normal, happy life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ That's all I want for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! I sound like an old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, that's how I really feel. For Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want Yu-No to be happy. But I don't need to lie to myself, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll never forgive the one who killed Celes, the one who tried to kill Yu-No. Never.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want Yu-No to remain hidden⋯to stay safe.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Uh, Dad⋯ Haha nope, go fish⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is she dreaming about? Huh.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be back, Yu-No. I'll be right back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a beautiful courtyard, especially in the morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lot of people sacrificed to create this garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This garden is soaked in the blood of the people who toiled to make it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch is sure to come this way, and all alone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. I'll hide in the shadow of one of the corridor's pillars near the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a perfect place for an ambush.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to wait right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the sword I got from Illia.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry Illia⋯ I know you pledged loyalty to the God-Monarch, but now I will use your sword to kill him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I don't kill him with a single blow, I can at least wound him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're definitely coming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I just have to wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've thought about this so many times.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I even tried to rethink the whole thing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I couldn't sleep the whole night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mind is made up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch may have been kind to Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that was just to protect his own interests.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't matter what the reason is, sacrificing someone's life to strengthen your own power is unforgivable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch killed Celes and tried to hurt Yu-No, too. I will never forgive that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. Where is he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why isn't he showing up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said that he comes through this corridor every morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ryuuzouji was lying to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Calm down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just calm down. It's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It hasn't even been 10 minutes yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know he'll show up. I just know it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty nervous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I'm nervous. I've never killed anyone before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I fail, I'll be in danger myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I fail, I might even die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if the God-Monarch brings guards?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if today's the one day he decided to surround himself with guards?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Amanda was captured, if she told them my goal is to kill the God-Monarch⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, shit, shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My thoughts keep going back to the worst-case scenario.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes, lend me your strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this keeps up, my heart's gonna explode.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! I just say whatever suits me, don't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way Celes would have approved of this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she was still alive, I'm sure she'd stop me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. This is all me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes wouldn't want this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll kill the God-Monarch for the sake of my own satisfaction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can hear footsteps! He's here!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm down. Calm down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's okay. Calm down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm down, heart!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Quit it with the thumping.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to wait until he's closer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Still too far away⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hurry up! Come closer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's he doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, this is a long corridor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a little longer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A little more. Just a little more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Once I've drawn him out enough, I just need one solid blow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*huff⋯huff⋯huff*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Get over here already!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart's gonna explode!)[%p]
⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The footsteps stopped.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He stopped?!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hello? Is someone there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm caught!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Who's there? Come out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that a woman's voice?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The God-Monarch is a woman?!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I see. You're here to kill me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]If you don't come out, I'll call the Royal Guards.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So, it's come to this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a score to settle with you. I want you dead.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I see. I don't know why, but will you hear me out, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talking won't help you. Die![%p]
[name]Voice[line]You⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Prepare yourself!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. It can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's impossible![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Takuya. It's been a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This can't be true⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why⋯?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You've grown so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you⋯ Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I didn't recognize you. Look at how much you've changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean⋯ Why?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is it Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The God-Monarch was Ayumi the whole time?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know how you feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why⋯ Why you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Trust me, I understand how you feel right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Are you the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer me![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is the God-Monarch?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The person who tried to kill me was Ayumi?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does all of this mean?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I knew you would come sooner or later, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You knew?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]When I sensed you in the shadow of that pillar, I was both happy and sad that you had finally arrived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean 「finally」?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I've waited a long time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me what you mean![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's a long story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll listen.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Here! An intruder![%p]
[name]Voice[line]He took the priestess![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Don't let the intruder escape alive![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh shi–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no! It's the Royal Guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Royal Guard?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They don't know how we're connected, Takuya. They treat intruders without mercy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Go home today. You can get to the city from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, wait![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Go! Hurry![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad?! What's the matter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, we have to run.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]H-Huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Now! Go through the main gate to reach the city.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ah, God-Monarch. Good morning.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yu-No, keep your dad safe.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯ What are you⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's no time to talk now.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]The courtyard.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]He's taking the God-Monarch![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Capture the intruder![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Meet me here in this courtyard at the same time tomorrow morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Remember, tomorrow morning! Now hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I'll be here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, do you know the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As unbelievable as it is to say, yes, I do.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hm⋯ She's nice, isn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]There he is![%p]
[name]Voice[line]You will not harm the priestess. Kill that man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, we have to run![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I came here to kill the God-Monarch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But the God-Monarch is Ayumi, and she was kind to Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. I don't know what's going on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just have to focus on escaping for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll think after I get away!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to come back tomorrow morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tomorrow morning in the same garden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These guys don't give up. They're still after us.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, times like these are why you need to exercise. Whew![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ah, they're here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, this way's no good.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do we do? All we can do is run![%p]
[name]Voice[line]This way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]This way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Who's there?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, someone's calling us from that back alley.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alley?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Quick, this way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. Amanda?![%p]
[name]A Voice[line]Don't let them get away. After them![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just stand here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not Amanda?!)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Whoa, you're pointing that sword at the wrong person. Point it at the Royal Guards behind you, not me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You've grown quite a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep hearing that today.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no reason you should be saying that to me. Just who are you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What if I told you there was a reason for me to say that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]It's me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know a 「me.」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You haven't changed one bit, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Don't mind the sunglasses. They're just protecting my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhhh!!![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hey! Quiet down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Ms. Eriko? Is that you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah, so you still call me Ms., eh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯ You're here, too?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, who is this, Dad?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Daaad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be quiet, Yu-No. You'll only complicate things further.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're not her sugar daddy, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. She's my real daughter![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Huh, I see⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, why is this woman staring at me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]From what I can see, you did very well for yourself, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It may not be as great as mine, but she's got a nice body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of talk is that?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, right. The Royal Guards lost you, but they'll be searching here soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]For now, just be sure to drink milk every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's the secret to a good body, after all. Every. Day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, right. You look like you're in a bit of a tough spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my line.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're with a woman who calls you Dad, and you're being chased by the Royal Guard. That's pretty interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she serious?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why don't you come to my hideout for now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hideout?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. It's a house. Where I hide. There are a lot of empty houses in the Imperial Capital, so no one complains if you claim one for yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll talk more there?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, we will.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe I ran into Ms. Eriko right after Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is going on?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. You've had quite an experience.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You started at the Border, crossed the desert, survived the mine, and made it to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha! When you put it like that, even I don't believe it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You'd make a pretty penny if you published your autobiography.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care what people think.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's too bad. It's a really interesting story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. The girl sleeping in the next room⋯ What was her name again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right. Yu-No. I find it interesting that she's considered a priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll have to factor the priestess into my thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already told you that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You didn't tell me everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's true. I want to know what happened to you, Ms. Eriko. The rest is insurance.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You've grown so much. Of course, you did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop saying things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe I ran into Ms. Eriko in a place like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All we're doing is talking, but it makes me sort of happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I always thought she was a strange teacher. I never suspected she was this kind of woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just have to ask her.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You were always with Mom. It made me⋯jealous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were always getting between us.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Was I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Whenever Celes and I started being affectionate, you would come rushing over.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hah⋯ I was competing with Mom over you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You know that, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I love you more than anything else in the world, Dad, more than Mom. One day, I declared war against her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you really?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]And Mom gave a smile that said, 「I accept your challenge.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We were good rivals.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I say to that?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]When Mom died, for some reason, I wasn't sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I didn't cry, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, you didn't. I think I took the brunt of it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Do you know why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mom isn't dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, I mean she's dead, but not gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mom went into my heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She came into my heart and spoke to me. She told me to take care of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]So, I told her⋯ I told her I didn't want to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I told her we should love you together, as one. And she said, 「All right.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mom is still inside here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong? Am I making you⋯uncomfortable?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not uncomfortable. I actually like it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She needs to understand how I feel when she grabs my hand like that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was nice, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I saying?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Why do you look confused?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think I ruined the moment.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]When we're like this, I can remember what it was like when we all lived together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I wonder if Kun-Kun is okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lizard⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes. She's my friend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kun-Kun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she's doing. She's probably living happily in the forest. I bet she is.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah, I'm sure she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I lied⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what else could I have said?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that altar?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I don't really know. But when I slept there, it was nice and soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was nice?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup. I got kind of sleepy, and I could hear a voice calling me from far away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They were brainwashing you. It's terrible.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But it felt really nice. It was far away, but I thought I recognized that voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was brainwashing. That's how they were going to make you do what they wanted.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You proved it was brainwashing when you–[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]When I⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It might upset her if I say she threatened me with a sword.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I don't know, but⋯ When I listened to that voice, my heart felt warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Then when I opened my eyes, I could see a corridor beyond the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]When I walked down it, there was a very familiar smell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]And then you were there, Dad![%p]
*scoot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't scoot so close to me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The voice in my dream told me something else. It said someone important to me had arrived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You're the only person who's important to me, Dad. So, I ran as fast as I could.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you looked like you hadn't even taken the time to dress.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I⋯ Sheesh, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how heavy the subject, it always seems lighter when I talk to Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel stupid worrying so much all the time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe that's because of Yu-No, too?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, now can I ask?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ask about what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About⋯ What happened after⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]After what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After they took you away from me in front of that temple.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was worried they were doing terrible things to you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No, they didn't do terrible things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thank God. Those guys are pretty quick to hurt people.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]That's not how it was at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]They were so grateful to see me. They even called me Lady Priestess! I ate lots of good food, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]They said being Mom's daughter made me a priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You would have liked the food, Dad. I thought being a priestess wouldn't be so bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen. Do you know what a priestess is?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I heard their job is to perform a ceremony that channels a god.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! Is that what that God-Monarch said?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know why Celes⋯ You know why your mother was killed, don't you?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They killed an innocent woman to further their own interests.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah, I don't think that's good, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you think I'm going to accept some kind of charity from them⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯*sniffle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey! That's nothing to cry about, is it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I was a little harsh, but you understand, right?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I know. That's why I love you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's got some guts.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Just the two of us. It's been a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it has.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
*scoot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. You're nudging up against me again.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The way you smell⋯*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa?! Hey! Knock it off! What are you, a dog or something?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]That's the kind of scent that makes a woman feel good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You⋯ Where did you learn to say that?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet garden, just Yu-No and I.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Cheer up. I'm here with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, thanks.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I love you for Mom, too. Forever and ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! I'm honored. I'm lucky to be your father.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I was hoping you'd say you were lucky to be a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did she just say what I think she said?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet garden. It's just you and me, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]D-Dad?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Don't say it's just you and me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You can't say that! Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about? Hey, quit squirming around.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's been so long since it was just the two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah, that's true. I wonder how long it's been⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Feels like it's been forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Forever⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No and I⋯and Celes made three.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How long ago was that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels like it was a hundred years ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now, Yu-No's an adult.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks so much like Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're all grown up.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mhm, I'm an adult now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ I see that.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Can you tell I'm just radiating womanly charm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What makes you say that?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, that's because⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, of course. I'm completely and totally overwhelmed by your majestic presence.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Majestic presence?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Very funny, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You know, you've gotten so manly since the last time I saw you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I-I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wh-Whoa! What's going on here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her clothing looks like something the knights would wear.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's showing a lot of thigh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't like that thigh slit.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not good to show off that much skin.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ah ha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with you?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What you said⋯makes me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, why?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I can see you're jealous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm speaking common sense.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Uh-huh! Ah, I love you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't matter what I say.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with those weird clothes?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, uh, I borrowed them from a knight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's why it looks like armor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Knock it off!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get it. You want to show off how good you look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, why are you so worried about this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is stupid. I should just give up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter what world I'm in, that's none of my business.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What are you looking at, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, she's looking good⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](As a father, I'm both happy and sad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That slit's too much if you ask me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can practically see your whole butt![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]*giggle* You're weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you are a very impressive woman.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, this garden is very impressive.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It is pretty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop! Don't go back there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I am curious, though⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to send Yu-No there now.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, if we want to leave the castle, we can. The front gate is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The front gate? Is that how we get home?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The dungeon?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But Dad, you just said we had to stay here until morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. We have to stay here until morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't do it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No will be tempted to jump in⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, I need a bath.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! Keep your clothes on![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not getting in.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ah, a bath. Get in with me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. You've got to be kidding. I don't think so.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, come on. You're no fun![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop it. Yu-No might lick my ear again.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
*lick lick*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Agh! Okay, okay![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ew. You're a little salty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was sweating, sorry.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's okay. It's just you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If you do it again, I'll lick your ears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you a dog?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like your ears![%p]
*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, hahaha! No touching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
*tickle tickle*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Eek! That tickles![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are they so pointy?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hm⋯ I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't touch that.)[%p]
*squeeze⋯rub*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, are you choking on food or something? Why are you pointing at your chest?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just⋯ Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please, just stop it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm doing my best here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna touch her butt![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Huh⋯ What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ My butt itches!!! *scratch scratch*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
*scratch, scratch*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching your butt so much?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ I'm just really itchy here. *scratch scratch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't touch Yu-No's butt. I'd hate myself.)[%p]
