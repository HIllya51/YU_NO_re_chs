[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already past ten, but it looks like nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard a voice back there. Maybe I should check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is someone there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer me. Is it you, old man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, old man! Is that you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong? Answer me![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the back of the mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I heard a voice coming from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only person at the shrine right now is me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind is cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the old bastard really here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell happened to the old bastard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rippling of the ocean, and the sound of the trees makes it seem even more peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this cold?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the wind from the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boulder. There was a voice coming from behind the mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is a city landmark, but nobody knows what it means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's writing carved into the boulder on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The two boulders look like they're facing each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems that nobody intentionally placed them like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, behind the mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like someone's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something looming in the shadows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an incredibly oppressive feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only place you could call the base of the Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The person mentioned in the letter isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's supposed to be someone here at the base.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's nobody here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's looming there quietly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of the Sword Cape is known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I supposed to be waiting here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are too many trees for me to get around to the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get hurt if I'm not careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees are rustling in the breeze off the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees are rustling. It feels kind of cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're blowing quietly in the ocean breeze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go around behind the mountain for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was my imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm sure I heard something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. I won't make any progress like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I heard something just now. What the hell was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is someone playing a trick on me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm sure the letter was his handwriting. I'll never forget that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was a jerk, but he didn't break promises.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's showing up. Was this a prank?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not coming. Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought the old bastard would eventually show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When he said the base of Triangle Mountain, he meant this shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know this is the right place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he's not coming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already a couple minutes past ten.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It seems like the voice came from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it the old bastard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. I can barely walk with all these trees around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I slip down these boulders, I'll fall right into the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hellooo! Are you there old man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you can hear me, say something![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anybody here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no way. I know I heard a voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a person on the ground? There's a person on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is this woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't look hurt. And she's still breathing, at least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not toward the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The place I want to go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should wait a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's several minutes past ten.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the old bastard was punctual if nothing else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He wasn't the type to be even ten minutes late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ I haven't met the person I came here for.[%p]
