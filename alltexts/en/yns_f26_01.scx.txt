[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I know she said to stay put, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, what's that? What's happening?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the door in the back opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Kaori? She's not back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Either way, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should probably hide, even if it's just for the time being.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori is taking forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really feel like it's a bad idea to stay here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But do I have anywhere to go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori's not back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I really just be standing around here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If someone comes, it's all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So there's no need to push it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should have used the card first and then pushed the button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The order is very important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can get inside with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pushing it doesn't seem to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pushing doesn't work. What about pulling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like I can't pull it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has the same device on this side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a place to push.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course nothing happens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are buttons lining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it'll open if I push one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small blue light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a thin opening like a slit. It's the card reader.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a tiny light. It's blue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door in front of me opened with this though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's different about this one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's some sort of switch here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it'll open if I push one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light is blue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small, red light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a very thin opening, like a slit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's probably where you insert the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small light on. It's red. It's just like Kaori said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get through this door unless that light turns blue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at this is making my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect brightness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm all alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The red light hurts my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bright red light against the gray wall makes it stand out even more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This really feels like an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Kaori told me not to move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just take a peek inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going into Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the second time I've been here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Ayumi isn't here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is closed, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Ayumi's office. The door is closed now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It opened, so that means I can go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori said the thing she's after is in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the–?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door's locked, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing Kaori's after should be on the other side of this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the door's locked, so I can't get in.[%p]
