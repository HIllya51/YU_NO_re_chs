[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's nothing in the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do with a rope?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No point in using a rope now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if I use this rope⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tie one end to the tree⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I can drop the other end down the well. It's best to tie knots in intervals for something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll silently sneak down toward it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, just a bit more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A little⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Further⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah! What the?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff huff* I didn't think the rope would come untied. Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rope fell down to the bottom of the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But at least I got this piece of paper and the Silver Medal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some writing on it. It's blurred and hard to read, but it says⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Use⋯and the door shall be opened⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door shall be opened⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What door is gonna open up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I'll hold on to this Silver Medal for now.[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Silver Medal][color index="800000"].

[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. I can barely see anything inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pointless to use a rope.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use :selitem: for :selatr:⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off, what am I supposed to do with :selitem: on :selatr:?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's give it some more thought⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I don't think those go together very well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't use :selitem: there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't supposed to be used for :selatr:, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't something I can use now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening⋯ Well, that's not surprising.[%p]
