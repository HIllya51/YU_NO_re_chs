[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antique-style light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty old-looking light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it really sets the atmosphere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll want to go to the bathroom if I keep looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bathroom's in the back on the left side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like going to the bathroom right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could increase entropy here, but the waitress would yell at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, it's incredibly unnatural for entropy to be small and ordered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meaning this caf⑮ is breaking the laws of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I'm the only one who would think this much about simple tables and chairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tables and chairs are evenly spaced around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entropy is extremely low.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, there is a tendency of things to move from order to disorder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light hanging down like some kind of plump eggplant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the caf⑮'s style of choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These curtains are rather unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rolling screens have become more popular recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are paintings on the walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone said that art isn't determined by the people, but by a bunch of brokers somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand that, I guess. I can't see what's so good about this painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some paintings on the walls, but I have no clue what they're depicting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an innocuous painting.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hmm. To change jobs or not to change jobs.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, hey there.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Can『t you tell I』m trying to have a conversation with her? I'm an employee at Geo Technics. What a surprise, huh?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Didn't you see them on TV before? Collusion with the mayor, all that stuff.[%p]
[name]Man[line]That's why I'm thinkin' about changing jobs.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]But women like men with a steady income. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Let me tell you something, kid.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]It's taboo to talk about another girl in front of a pretty lady.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What? A female student with a yellow headband?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Even my man wouldn't go that far. At least make her a nurse or a policewoman.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wait, you're not talking about cosplay?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Actually, I'm a big fan of the teacher look.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, that's all from me this time.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What's your height⋯ Hey, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, why did I ever make him my boyfriend?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]He only makes 20 million yen a year, he's only 6 feet tall, went to a good college, and he's a handsome, skinny man.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]How much do you make, by the way? Hey, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What's wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I'm trying to talk with my boyfriend about our future.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Please leave us alone.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey, I'm the boyfriend she's talking about.[%p]
[name]Man[line]That company has nothing to do with me.[%p]
[name]Man[line]There's something fishy about that place if you ask me. I'm talking about the construction on the coastline.[%p]
[name]Man[line]All that digging and the transportation trucks everywhere? How is that a geological survey?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Well, I guess that's how it was meant to be.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Actually, I just heard something on the radio.[%p]
[name]Man[line]A police investigation might take place pretty soon.[%p]
[name]Man[line]They should probably stop working at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I was actually thinking of going down to the site for work this morning.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Then I heard there was another lightning strike last night, so I noped out of there.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What, it wasn't in the papers?[%p]
[name]Man[line]The company must be hiding it.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I mean, they say when there's life, there's hope, right?[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh* I guess I should just continue my nobody lifestyle.[%p]
[name]Man[line]A guy that gets a salary is called a salaryman, and a guy that gets nothing is a nobody.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I'm nobody, by the way. Ahahaha.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I was thinking about working construction down at the coastline. That's a pretty dangerous place to work now, I hear.[%p]
[name]Man[line]The pay is supposed to be really good.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh* Sitting down quietly, sipping coffee like this.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Ah, people with nothing to do sure live a sad existence.[%p]
[name]Man[line]We're in a recession now. That time when we were working 24/7 before the bubble burst seems like forever ago.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Man[line]If you find something, let me know.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What, a girl? Still looking for her?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Man[line]She's a student and has a headband, and is a little gloomy, you say?[%p]
[name]Man[line]That's a pretty detailed character. What kind of caf⑮ does she work at?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey, don't hit me so hard.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, you were here last night. You must be a regular now.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Asking me if I saw a girl?[%p]
[name]Man[line]There are a bunch of girls like that at this one place I regularly visit. It's really nice there.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Excuse me⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]They offer some really rich milk⋯*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Man[line]Why do you look so annoyed?[%p]
[name]Man[line]It's custom to stand and put your hand on your hip while you drink milk, apparently.[%p]
[name]Man[line]It's best if the milk is in a glass bottle, too.[%p]
[name]Man[line]You should try it some time.[%p]
[name]Man[line]You want me to look at you?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Sorry, but I'm a bit shy.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Ahhh⋯ I live for a glass like this![%p]
[name]Man[line]This is really good milk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Caf⑮s and greenery are completely inseparable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is pretty empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fancy, yet it's not that crowded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a jukebox.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like song number 1 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 2 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 3 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 4 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 5 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 6.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 7 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 8 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 9.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 10 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can play whatever song you like in the caf⑮ by pressing the button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want it to stop, hit the red EXIT button on the bottom right and things will go back to normal.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm gonna go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song really makes this place feel like a caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of when I talked to Ms. Eriko on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song has a somber mood to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song puts me on edge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me want to jump for joy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song brings back so many memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm moving outside when I listen to this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason I want to call for my big brother when I hear this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The poppy rhythms in this song sound so fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me feel like I need to stay up all night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of that one game.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listening to this song makes me realize there's some strange music in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, pressing that isn't going to do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Press the button.[%p]
