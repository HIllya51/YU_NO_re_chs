[name]Takuya[line]I'll try taking a closer look at this body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a PDA there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the PDA with me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already have the PDA.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Change the control mode by pressing the :btnR1:. It will activate when you choose 「Use」 on the PDA.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm turning it on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The login name was hers, if I remember correctly. Yurika Imagawa, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yurika⋯ I think that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should take this PDA with me.[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][PDA][color index="800000"].

[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a handheld computer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't activate it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't notice before, but there's something on the ground over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a handheld computer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did it belong to that woman⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it'll turn on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, it still works. It still has some battery life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A login prompt⋯ I won't be able to proceed unless I know the username.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know her name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I can't activate this PDA.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]There's a mummy in this tiny, stone room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has somewhat long hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's was longer than this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd say this hairstyle is somewhat long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She may have been pretty when she was alive⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I'm looking more closely, I can see there's a redness on its lips.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a thin layer of lipstick on its lips.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Assuming this isn't a guy wearing lipstick⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A woman⋯?
[name]Takuya[line]A woman⋯ What was she doing in a place like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
*thud*
[name]Takuya[line]Aaah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
*tap tap*[%p]
*thud*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's dead⋯right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ Don't scare me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's take a closer look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a woman be in a place like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course it's not her. Mio was healthy and lively up until yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wouldn't turn into a mummy overnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then who could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not Mio, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, it's someone I've never seen before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However⋯ I never thought I'd find a mummy here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was some kind of explorer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The clothes they're wearing are a bit different from your usual, casual clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The material is sturdy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the clothes my old man wore when he went off to the mountains in Tibet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Short sleeves and shorts. They're definitely easy clothes to move around in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a very casual outfit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This one⋯looks completely different than the skeletons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like this one was born much closer to our time than, say, the Kofun period.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn this thing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It broke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Being exposed to the humidity in the air must have weakened it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I managed my original goal of opening it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now to see what's inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A notebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I read it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it's going to break. What am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The clasp⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's tough, but I think if I really go at it, it'll break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The clasp doesn't seem easy to open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I'll have to come back to this later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bag.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a clasp with a metal belt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt ancient society had anything like this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but crumbs in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She probably had some emergency rations in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now, there's nothing left but biscuit crumbs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there were emergency rations or something in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's completely empty now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like this opens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ There are some crumbs. Are they from a biscuit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ Looks like there were emergency rations or something in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, I'm pretty hungry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hands and feet are all dried out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like they died from dehydration though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Signs of dehydration⋯ This thing is pretty much a mummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must feel a little damp because we're underground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I should be respectful of the dead, but this kind of makes me sick⋯ Guh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's stabbing in the opposite direction, which probably means this was suicide⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's stabbing her in the opposite direction⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something is off⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Two skeletons skewered by spears in the same room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's easy to see something went wrong for them⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, this body is stabbed into the wall, in the opposite direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The first and second bodies must have been killed at a different time from the third body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Moreover, the mummy looks fairly new.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the skewer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Went straight through the body⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They must have died almost instantly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this is the cause of death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a sharp rock thrusting from the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a jagged rock sticking out of the fractured wall. They must have run right into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a mummy in this tiny, stone room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First there were skeletons in a dark room, and now there's a mummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm hopping around different horror movie sets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The exit is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dirty notebook inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot written in this thing. Should I read it again?[%p]
Read the handbook
Don't read it
[name]Takuya[line]Right, maybe I shouldn't.[%p]
May 10th. [linebreak]I've finally arrived.[%p]
I wonder how many years it took to get here. It was quite a long time. For once, I can look back on old times and smile.[%p]
This is the result of my grounded research⋯ I'd never felt more excited or hopeful than when I realized the theory I formulated might actually be correct.[%p]
It was like the time I got the device he entrusted to me.[%p]
Long ago, I researched the irregularities in the magnetic and gravitational fields surrounding Sword Cape here in Sakaimachi.[%p]
There's an odd theory that the Earth's crust has a highly dense and powerful gravitational pull in this area. I searched for proof of such an absurd idea.[%p]
And now, I believe I am closer than ever to the answer. I'm shaking. It was like the time I acquired that contraption⋯[%p]
The device he entrusted to me.[%p]
The Reflector Device.[%p]
I need to thank Dr. Arima, who allowed me to name it. You could say the small device he gave me changed my life.[%p]
I untied one thread at a time, and this is where it led me.[%p]
I don't have nearly enough room to write about it all here. So, I'll have to leave out the bits about the R Device.[%p]
Dr. Ryuuzouji and I looked at Sword Cape and dreamed of making the biggest discovery in history.[%p]
Dr. Arima, however, was researching something completely different: a rare metal called the Hypersense Stone, which is buried underneath this town.[%p]
At some point, our paths converged and our goals aligned.[%p]
Dr. Arima's wealth of knowledge is much too broad to simply call him a historian. His intuition and thought process are remarkably innovative. He really surprised me back then.[%p]
He worked hard with his wife to analyze the stone, but his recent work is mostly incomprehensible to me.[%p]
It doesn't seem like he has the same, purely intellectual and academic interest as I do.[%p]
I still don't know what his goal is. However, it's true that we seem to be headed in the same direction.[%p]
I require his talents, and he requires mine.[%p]
I think it's best we don't snoop into each other's private lives⋯especially for Dr. Arima.[%p]
May 13th. [linebreak]The investigation begins.[%p]
I'm secretly conducting research with my colleagues, Dr. Arima and Dr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
I'm not doing this to get my name out there. I'm doing this to prove my theory and preserve our research.[%p]
I spent a lot of time examining the engraving on the 400-year-old ruins at the base of Sword Cape.[%p]
The words written there don't seem to have any particular meaning. Instead, it seems that the way the symbols line up and the pattern itself are what contain the meaning.[%p]
In the early stages of my research, I realized that it was an artifact made long ago.[%p]
The engraving pointed to the entrance of this place.[%p]
May 15th. [linebreak]Results from my investigation.[%p]
I'm trembling with anticipation and awe. My hand is shaking like a scared child. I can barely write at all.[%p]
I may be able to solve the ancient mystery of Sakaimachi. Japan's oldest mystery lies here, beneath Sword Cape.[%p]
Even accounting for a certain margin of error, carbon dating has placed the creation of this place as far back as 8,000 years ago.[%p]
This ancient burial chamber existed long before the written history of mankind began.[%p]
 I'm very disappointed that I couldn't get a big research team in here.[%p]
When was it built? Why? And for whom?[%p]
I cannot help but return to the fundamental questions of historical study.[%p]
In the grand scheme of things, 8,000 years is just a drop in the bucket.[%p]
To quote Dr. Arima, it's merely the blink of an eye in the history of time.[%p]
You can tell the civilization that built this held polarizing ideals.[%p]
Good and evil, existence and non-existence, conscious and unconscious. Do these ideas permeate through all civilizations?[%p]
May 16th. [linebreak]I'm trapped, all alone⋯[%p]
That door is quite the rascal. I did not think that disc key would be required.[%p]
Of course, I only have my own impatience to blame.[%p]
There are so many traps within this place⋯ But why? What are they protecting?[%p]
It isn't in my blood to sit around and wait to be rescued. I'll keep exploring around here some more.[%p]
Although I have no idea what results I hope to produce by doing so⋯[%p]
May 17th. [linebreak]My rations are gone⋯[%p]
I haven't eaten anything in two days⋯ I don't have any more emergency ration biscuits.[%p]
I lick the groundwater off the walls, but I'm slowly starving to death⋯[%p]
What happened here?[%p]
A great historian once said, 「The history of man is the history of war.」 I wonder if this horrible scene provides support for such a claim⋯[%p]
May 18th. [linebreak]It's been three days since I last ate⋯[%p]
The fat stored in my body should be enough to endure three days of starvation⋯but that idea only works in theory.[%p]
I'm certain moving around so much didn't help. The exhaustion and hunger are making me dizzy⋯[%p]
If I got in here, then there has to be a way out. It would be so unfortunate to meet my demise with such incredible treasures practically in the palm of my hand.[%p]
May 19th[linebreak]⋯[%p]
May 20th[linebreak]⋯[%p]
May 21st[linebreak]⋯[%p]
I found the exit⋯ I never thought it would be there. I completely overlooked it.[%p]
Yet I lack the physical strength to open it. It was right in front of me the whole time⋯ How did I not notice it until now?[%p]
I am now writing down the method in this journal. Even if I can't move my body, I can still move my fingers and use my head⋯ How ironic.[%p]
The logic behind it is simple. The symbols lined up are part of a 12 number system.[%p]
The numbers on top and to the side of the tiles represent a continuous line of buttons.[%p]
If there are several numbers lined up, then you must align the buttons continuously according to the number displayed.[%p]
You must also leave a blank space between each number.[%p]
I can't believe I figured this out only after physical exhaustion set in.[%p]
The angel probably represents consciousness, and the demon represents unconsciousness. And the symbols represent numbers as well as letters at the same time.[%p]
When the conscious and unconscious meet, the symbols carved into the angel's side will⋯[%p]
I will outline a specific method below⋯[%p]
(The page is ripped out. It's missing⋯)[%p]
I input a simple program into the PDA.[%p]
This should always give you access⋯[%p]
The login is my name⋯[%p]
May 22nd[linebreak]⋯[%p]
I'm finally at my limits.[%p]
I shall meet my end gracefully. I have no fear.[%p]
There's a spear like object sticking out of the broken stone wall.[%p]
Maybe it's most appropriate that I die here, like this⋯ If there's one thing I regret, it's not being able to discover the secret of Sword Cape until the end⋯[%p]
The dream I wished to fulfill⋯ Departure from this world⋯ I do not fear death.[%p]
I am only filled with regret.[%p]
I was so close to unveiling this world's secrets⋯[%p]
Arima⋯ I⋯was⋯[%p]

               ACU Professor[linebreak]               Yurika Imagawa.[%p]

This path is designed in such a way that you must lock the way you came before you are able to move forward.[%p]
This kind of design would work perfectly as a prison, but I can't be sure if that's what this place was made for.[%p]
However, if that is the case, then the hole near the door ahead must be some kind of emergency escape route. That has to be the closest thing to an exit.[%p]
I completely let the exit out of my sight. What a terrible mistake to make.[%e]
