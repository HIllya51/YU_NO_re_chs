[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Ms. Eriko and Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ms. Eriko go?[%p]
Where could she be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's running toward the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right then, the same goes for me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city is shining brilliantly tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big bank in Sakaimachi. It's called Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's closed now. If I come back during the day, I might be able to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A Saikyou staff member will come out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting tired of doing stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Just one more time.[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi. A salesperson?[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]I'm Suzuki of Saikyou. Nice to meet you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Suzuki of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, Suzuki may be the strongest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go in one more time?[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]Hi. Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi.[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]I am the receptionist for Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go inside for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]Hi. Welcome. Welcome to Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi. Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]I'm the branch manager of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The branch manager of Saikyou. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does the sign say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Bring your money in right away!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Powerful staff are waiting for you.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Saikyou Bank?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In such a big city, it's not surprising that there are a couple of banks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tree-lined street in front of me leads to the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the tree-lined street downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The look of the city changes considerably between spring, summer, fall, and winter. It's a nice view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boutique. I don't need anything from this shop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a boutique in this building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi buys clothes at this store fairly often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are various buildings lined up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a long row of buildings downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area is mainly shops and offices, and the residential area is to the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is a signboard that stands out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coffee shop itself is quite large and relaxing, so it's perfect for meetings and killing time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright sign.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the sign for the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's bright lights make it impossible to see the stars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I look like a lunatic staring up at the sky all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky stretches on forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the building won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's head home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm trying to follow Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wrong way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staying here like this won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I keep wandering around here, those gangsters are bound to find me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to stay here a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, am I going back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just got downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go up to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's where I want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give the Heights a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go up to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I following Mio and Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I see them again, they are going to say something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I'll go to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really nice to just walk around for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should have fun around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That road leads up to the Heights. It's got a great view of the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm getting further away from my destination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really want to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, I'll give it a try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Ms. Eriko was headed in that direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go, I want to go with a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go there. I can sleep at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to the Evening Caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just left there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Ryuuzouji went into the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is he meeting that woman, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's bothering me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go into the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Evening Caf⑮ is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is only open for business in the evenings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Evening Caf⑮ is closed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But didn't Mitsuki ask me to come?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Evening Caf⑮ is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this place is only open for business in the evenings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Mitsuki would be in a coffee shop at this time of night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko might be⋯ Well, I'll try going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all in the name. The Evening Caf⑮ is only open in the evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should just go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this some kind of activity?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to have tea, I should just go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I'll go to the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Evening Caf⑮, again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just left there, but⋯ Oh, well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go into the Evening Caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not exactly in the mood to drink tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious about that woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've run into her twice at school. I'm even more curious about her body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio and Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're still walking around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Yuuki is flirting with Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's what it's like during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I told Yuuki to ask Mio out for coffee, but I'm surprised he actually did it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Mio left Yuuki and is headed this direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's heading this way.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you doing here, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was going to ask you the same thing. Why are you here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because he asked me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did he ask you to go to the hotel too?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't be a creep. Yuuki's not like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is he taking you then?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]He asked me to go to the caf⑮. That's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know how Yuuki feels about you, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Kind of, yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't just leave him standing there. Look at him, all alone, standing in shock outside the coffee shop.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No excuses! Isn't he younger than you? What's got you so angry?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go on. Shoo! Would you abandon a knight that offered to walk you home?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not going to tell you again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Yuuki's just inexperienced, so he comes off a little aggressive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should try to think of other⋯ Well, it's not my place to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Woman[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I saw that woman at school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That attractive woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Check out that outfit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, the way her hips sway is magnificent. That man passing by her crouched down all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know how he feels. I'd probably do that too if I were him⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I guess not right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she went into the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she work at the caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, your knight is⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hi, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh heh⋯ You look well.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well yeah, uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((So, how are you?))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((Oh, so-so. A little happy, a little sad.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I see.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((She didn't want to go out for tea with me, but she invited me for tea at her home.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Good for you. I guess it all worked out.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((No, I don't think so.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey! What are you two whispering about?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]S-Sorry![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't worry, Yuuki. I'm just talking to that guy over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with the discrimination?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I prefer to call it differentiation. Let's go.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Excuse me, Takuya. How many times have I told you that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki was going towards the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The building over there is a major downtown coffee shop called the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As the name implies, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
