[name]Takuya[line]It was like one long dream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A very, very long dream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it really all a dream?[%p]
[margin top="266"][margin left="400"]Papa.
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My head⋯ It hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ What the hell's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel⋯something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone is calling for me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to escape from here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know there's somewhere else I need to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything from the walls to the ceiling is completely paved with stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I wonder where the air is coming from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not having any difficulty breathing at all⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing is built pretty damn sturdily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't break the wall to get outside, either⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the floor isn't going to help me get out of here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In order to get outside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't anything of note on the floor⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just some rocks on the ground⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Seems like I can't slide it to the side, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I can't get out from this way.[%p]
*bmbm⋯bmbmbmbm⋯*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ No good. I can't even make it budge by pushing it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe instead of pushing it, I can pull⋯oh, there's nothing for me to hold on to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see a dividing line here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door⋯ I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there are other ways to get out of here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I shouldn't go around pressing buttons recklessly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯is there anything else I can do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't too many different ways I can escape from here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First, I should⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I shouldn't go around pressing buttons recklessly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stone door is closed. I can't get outside from here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Looks like now isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
