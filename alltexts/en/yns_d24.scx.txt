[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhh![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What's with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is how I get when I see something dirty.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Eh, so what's dirty? Hey, don't point at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look as busy as always. Like you're in over your head.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Let's say I'm within my means. When you have a managerial position like me, you keep busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ So about last night.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are way too easy to read.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing on the coastline?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night, at the coastline, saw you, I.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Say the words in the right order, will you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, will you tell me what you were doing?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, I would think it was pretty dark at the coastline at night. Can you be certain it was me in all that darkness?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't accuse me without evidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's accusing anyone of anything. I was just asking what you were doing at the coastline last night.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or if you had anything to do with the truck accident last night?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If that's all, I'll be going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He left like he was running away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope he's not causing problems for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong? You've got a scary look on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, really?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. Looks like you're back to the old you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait, don't look so serious. It's just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't sound like a joke to me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm making a delivery. It's from the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Headmaster? You mean⋯ Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah. Mitsuki is Headmaster Ryuuzouji's secretary.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She might have some stuff to do for Ryuuzouji. Wait⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A delivery for Geo Technics? What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, what's wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're not that stubborn anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If so, it's because of you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, thanks. You're good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk⋯ She avoided me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's hard to get here with the uphill slope, but there are some good things as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ I found a comfortable-looking lawn. How about we talk for a bit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There are things I want to discuss with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's go then. Now, come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't push my back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something that was stuck in my heart feels looser now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it really because of Mitsuki?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a long time since I talked to her⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We used to⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oops, let's not think about that now. I have to talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A talk with Mitsuki, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does she want to talk about?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, I see⋯ So that was how it happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So, you had a fight with Mio and parted? *smirk* Maybe this is good timing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you really have to say it like that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry, but you haven't changed at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. I shouldn't have told her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is a woman who says what she thinks without holding back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But something that was stuck in my heart feels looser now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard the briefing went a little awry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look any different than normal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where they held the briefing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
