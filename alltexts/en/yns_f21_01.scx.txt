[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hotel is right in front of me.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]It's downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strangely calm here during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like that alcoholic isn't here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the fever medication now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This city's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This city's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm certain the Heights was just around the corner on the left.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big bank in Sakaimachi. It's called Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's closed now. If I come back during the day, I might be able to go inside.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have some money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm not saying I'm out of cash.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A Saikyou staff member will come out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting tired of doing stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Just one more time.[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi. A salesperson?[%p]
[name]Salesman[line]I'm Suzuki of Saikyou. Nice to meet you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Suzuki of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, Suzuki may be the strongest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go in one more time?[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]Hi. Welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi.[%p]
[name]Receptionist[line]I am the receptionist for Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go inside for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]Hi. Welcome. Welcome to Saikyou Bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi. Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Branch Manager[line]I'm the branch manager of Saikyou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The branch manager of Saikyou. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does the sign say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Bring your money in right away!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Powerful staff are waiting for you.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are the powerful staff members?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge bank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Saikyou Bank?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In such a big city, it's not surprising that there are a couple of banks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tree-lined street in front of me leads to the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the tree-lined street downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The look of the city changes considerably between spring, summer, fall, and winter. It's a nice view.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya Arima, you're very sensitive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a boutique. I don't need anything from this shop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a boutique in this building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi buys clothes at this store fairly often.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I've never used it before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are various buildings lined up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a long row of buildings downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area is mainly shops and offices, and the residential area is to the left.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Shouldn't we go to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is a signboard that stands out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coffee shop itself is quite large and relaxing, so it's perfect for meetings and killing time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big, bright sign.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the sign for the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You just left there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's nighttime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a rational opinion.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's bright lights make it impossible to see the stars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I look like a lunatic staring up at the sky all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky stretches on forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the building won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Don't you want to go now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'll go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Are you going back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Are you going back home?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Though, that's not the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. The Heights isn't this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go up to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not where I should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I should go to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go up to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mind meeting you at school tomorrow, but the sooner I can get it, the better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Let's go to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Let's go to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I keep going back and forth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, if I go up this way, I'll eventually get to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, let's go.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That store clerk said Kaori was waiting for me there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the hotel is that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's got nothing to do with me now.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that's not the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just left there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go to the caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I promised to meet with Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow! It's already six![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was supposed to meet her around five.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like the name implies, the caf⑮ is only open at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, yeah. I have an appointment with Kaori this evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Evening Caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I have time to go there now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any errands, but I guess I'll go anyway.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I think I just left there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is that right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
