[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Kaori probably went home too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Yuuki was looking for me. But where is he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? There's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial classes are over now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means Yuuki must have gone home too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are still quite a few students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is not at school. What about the company building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to deal with school right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just wondering about Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to be here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This hall's as lively as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already summer vacation. What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard the teacher is waiting, but where on earth are they going to be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I can't think of too many places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many students. Are they all people participating in club activities?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a school hallway with a surprising number of students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to find Ayumi and see what she has to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back when it was in style, someone put lighting all over this room. It's stupid, really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All it does is make my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's what they call indirect lighting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Indirect lighting is supposed to be done with some kind of padding on the cover or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's night time right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be releasing stuffy CO2.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it⋯ Plants perform photosynthesis during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it should be increasing oxygen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, it's this thing's fault⋯ Plants take in oxygen, which increases CO2 in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why it's so stuffy in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is probably the only one using it, since she's the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there an ashtray in the school's hall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it for guests?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a circular sofa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to be some kind of artwork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An 「exhibit.」 That's what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a strange object hanging from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it's supposed to represent the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know who drew the big picture there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to represent the sun⋯ I think I learned that when I started here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone told me that skylight opens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you open that? It is electric?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stars are shining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a skylight to bring in more light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes it bright and pleasant in here.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your current coordinate values. You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more written below⋯[%p]
「Be on the lookout for your current completion rate as well. Please use these in conjunction with each other.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there are any new postings.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your coordinate values on your map.」[%p]
「You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it mean? I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I hope there isn't a lightning strike today.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]The woman who appeared on TV, you know, the executive? She's pretty terrible.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What was her name? Arima, wasn't it?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What a coincidence. That's the same as your name.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Well, that's got nothing to do with you anyway.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Why are you staring at the floor?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Oh, hey Arima. It's you. Yesterday's lightning strike was really something.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I went down to the water to check it out after that. There didn't seem to be a lot of damage from the accident.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Did you watch News Presence last night?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]The one in charge at that company was beautiful.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Of course, she was sure to find a way to sidestep every question and avoid blame.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I hope people like that end up in hell.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Why are you hitting me?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I heard a terrible sound a while ago.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I'm busy talking to a girl right now.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Please don't bother me.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I am tired of sitting.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I want to stand and walk.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Are you asking me if I know your father?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]There's a guy standing over in front of that bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]He's been babbling about something weird for a while now. I wonder if he's okay⋯[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I've never heard the name Ayumi outside of the shop.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh? Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]A girl named Ayumi works in the shop I usually go to.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Excuse me⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Should I sell my thesis about thunder to the newspaper?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm not really sure if that's even a thing.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You know yesterday's lightning accident? I heard a rumor that lightning is striking regardless if it's sunny, stormy, or anything in between.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There have been lightning strikes all over the place.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Maybe it's just a matter of figuring out how it works.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you⋯ Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Well, I don't know.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]A lightning strike on the coastline?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you kidding? Look outside. It's so sunny.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh my, I want to do that.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Of course, Mahjong. Mahjong.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you asking me if I know you?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Arima? Don't they call you Boss Man or something?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What? Are you asking me if I know your father?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you asking me if I know your mother?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]No, I do not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do it anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Not much I can do about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think about what it's like to be in my position.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, I won't do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard work every time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, I won't do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I'll end up getting hit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guy is not Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I know you're here, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oops⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I quit. I've got no energy left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, so I'll fail once or twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got a nosebleed so bad it's dripping onto your fist, you dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, I love gossip.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, did you hear?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I heard Geo Technics will be undergoing an investigation soon.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It's got something to do with the current mayor and corruption.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]And that lightning is really strange.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Why it always strikes near the ocean is a mystery.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It's a nice day today.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I can't believe that lightning accident was only yesterday.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You're asking if I saw a creep wearing weird clothes?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Yeah, I saw him.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]He's talking to me right now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, don't look so insulted.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There's no way lighting would strike like that on such a clear day.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you taking about that sound?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You must be hearing things.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Don't pull up my skirt.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Watch out for women like that.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Their moods change like the flip of a switch.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You want to know if I'm like that. Haha! That's a secret.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't know your mother.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you asking me if I saw Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, I'm not sure. What does she look like?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Glasses, braided hair, older but attractive⋯ She's your mother?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You're having naughty thoughts, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]If you pull up my skirt, it'll cost you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What doesn't she know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll ask. Hey![%p]
[name]Student[line]Never heard of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people attending club activities look much more relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are all those guys in remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yes? What?[%p]
[name]Student[line]There is something interesting written on this bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, long time no see. Nice to see you again.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got good news to share, but it's kind of a long story.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]It takes a while to explain, but do you wanna hear?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]I should tell you about the four properties of branching points.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I told you about the first and second yesterday. If you don't remember, you should go back and ask.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Remember, there are four main patterns of branching law to the parallel world.[%p]
[name]Student[line]This is the third one. This is a case in which the action that takes place before the branch is reflected in the current branch.[%p]
[name]Student[line]For example, if we meet with Ms. A in the school infirmary, the lightning strike may happen along the coastline.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But if we don't meet Ms. A, and we go to the coastline instead, the lightning strike won't happen.[%p]
[name]Student[line]In other words, making a different choice means we'll see the alternate branch.[%p]
[name]Student[line]The fourth and last type is about seeing the end of a branch.[%p]
[name]Student[line]A branch can change depending on the ending.[%p]
[name]Student[line]There are some places you can't get to unless you've already seen other endings, so be sure to find those.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Phew! Explaining all this is tough.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Oh, and there's some interesting stuff written on this bulletin board. You should read the whole thing.[%p]
[name]Student[line]When we meet again in another parallel world, I may just give you another hint.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]Shh⋯ I'm experiencing the waves of the world right now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got some information to share with you, but it'll take time to explain.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]It takes a while to explain, but do you wanna hear?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]When you're looking for a branch, you can't just go blindly seeking ahead.[%p]
[name]Student[line]There's a mapping switch like a diamond at the bottom of the Reflector.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Sometimes it will blink repeatedly. When it does that, you'll need to be very careful.[%p]
[name]Student[line]It means a branch is approaching.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But I digress. I was talking about branches.[%p]
[name]Student[line]The first day of the main trunk–that's today–is really important.[%p]
[name]Student[line]That's when the branch routes will be established to some extent.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Remember, there are four main patterns of branching law to the parallel world.[%p]
[name]Student[line]The first type of branch is dependent on your destination.[%p]
[name]Student[line]For example, a branch can occur when you simply decide to go to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Student[line]This is pretty straightforward, so I'm sure you'll get the hang of it right away.[%p]
[name]Student[line]The second type of branch is dependent on items.[%p]
[name]Student[line]This type of branch occurs when you choose to use or not use specific items in a given scenario.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But you can't see those branches until you've discovered the necessary items that will cause them to form.[%p]
[name]Student[line]As for finding those items, well⋯ You'll have to find those yourself.[%p]
[name]Student[line]We can talk about the third type of branch the next time I see you.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Come here again tomorrow around the same time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]By the way, where is Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry, I don't know anything.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You want to know if I know what's going on at Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't know that man.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You're asking if I saw a man named Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't know. I've never heard that name before. Who is that?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Did you ask if I heard a terrible sound?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Well, I've actually had some trouble with my hearing lately.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry. I heard we can get pregnant just from talking to guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry. I heard we can get pregnant just from talking to guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]School rules. It's in the student handbook and everything.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Of course, it's not true.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry. I heard we can get pregnant just from talking to guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Arima? Aren't you the one they call Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you⋯ Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Uh, I don't think so. Who is she?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What? Your mother?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]So the rumors are true. You are a shameless flirt.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Why do you look so sad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may not see it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know everything about the school, but I know a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a school building directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary and offices are on the first floor down the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our classrooms are on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't tell if this student is male or female.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't touch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to touch some stranger's foot, especially if I don't know whether it's a man or woman.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle rustle*[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sometimes a joke is just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*spit*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to stop. I'm tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle rustle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dusty.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]In case anyone didn't already know, I'm a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯shouldn't have touched you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around in the school hallway isn't going to get anything done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to the school infirmary or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is at the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki was talking about another teacher. It had nothing to do with Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ms. Eriko is here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to the school infirmary or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Ms. Eriko mention a staff meeting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she'd attend one of those⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way to the school infirmary. I wonder if Ms. Eriko is there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go check out the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Off to the second floor![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If a teacher finds me here, I'll get in trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside![%p]
