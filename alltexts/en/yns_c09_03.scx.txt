[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bed right in front of me. Look, over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtain is closed. That's odd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is someone sleeping?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, something has me wondering.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even though there are some classes, what kind of person comes to sleep at the school infirmary during summer vacation?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be funny if Mio was skipping class and sleeping here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that were the case, I'll end up having the upper hand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gently, gently⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](S-She's in the middle of changing her clothes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's all dressed up. Is she going somewhere?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](B-But still⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this really happening?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I mean hell yeah!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I probably shouldn't be saying that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know Ms. Eriko was so pretty⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, she's really pretty⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Who was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is someone there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, oh no!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be okay here⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's coming out of the school infirmary. Oh no![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Try being a little careful you⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What a coincidence. You're from the Citizen's Association, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]The company briefing is about to begin. I'm about to go there for an interview.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The briefing?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]As citizens, we have a right and duty to protect our positions. We have to protest what Geo Technics is doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, but I⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You should go, too. The more people, the more effective we'll be.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Try being a little careful you⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What a coincidence. You're from the Citizen's Association, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The company briefing is about to begin. I'm about to go there for an interview.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The briefing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]As citizens, we have a right and duty to protect our positions. We have to protest what Geo Technics is doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, but I⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should go, too. The more people, the more effective we'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She just talked at me without listening at all. What a selfish woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that company briefing she mentioned?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that what Ayumi said she'd be doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're not doing that on purpose, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's where the curtain is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In front of me. Look, over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you curious what's behind the curtain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't need any items now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the time to use that.[%p]
