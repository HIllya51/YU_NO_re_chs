[name]Yuuki[line]You said Kanna. Do you mean Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know her? Mio would be mad to find out you're paying attention to another girl.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Th-That's not it. It's uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why's he being so evasive?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's your trademark, huh, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always have it on.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's right. I always have it on, whether I'm eating, sleeping, or in the shower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Such a weirdo.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Rumor has it that there's still a curse around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A curse⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Look, it's that old samurai mansion you can see from the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's that news I've seen on gossip TV programs.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It should help me get into a good spot with Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A good spot?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah! I am walking her home after remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's dangerous out at night. Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Shall I tell you a bit more about the rumors surrounding Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No thanks. It's just some dirty gossip, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, that's true.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, the bell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Well, the bell is only for the people taking remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell are you expecting?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How about I attend your remedial classes for you, Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I would go through hell and high water for you, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ Mio said she was gonna attend remedial classes voluntarily, too.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, okay. Just make sure you don't get caught sitting in for me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That'll be as cool as a breeze![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, 「cool」 and 「breeze」⋯ You get it? A cool breeze?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough. Get going.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki left⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that's how it is. She came out of a hotel with a pervert old enough to be her father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she has an illegal part-time job where she earns some spending money by making old men feel good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earning money like that with her cute little face. Oh my-my, how disgraceful![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What was that at the end?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's how girls would gossip about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, that's probably not far off the mark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She is pretty cute, so I'm sure there are a lot of girls who are jealous, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So you're saying they were jealous of Hatano and spread bad rumors about her on purpose?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What else could it be?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, I can't deny that theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, so the guys she's popular with are the ones with a one-track mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, if you have money, she'll let you⋯ S-Sorry, don't look so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now Yuuki, I'm sure you wouldn't jump on the bandwagon and believe these dumb rumors, would you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Of course not. I only have eyes for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good then.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You wanted to know about the rumors, so I was just telling you what I heard, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Phew⋯ Your look so scary sometimes, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But even if they are just rumors, where there's smoke, there's fire. There must be some reason.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, there are eye-witness accounts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm listening.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on, don't look so serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]A girl that sits next to me in class actually saw Hatano with a man downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong with that? Having one or two guy friends is fine.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, it would have been fine if they weren't coming out of a hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Three female students saw it at the same time, so they can't all be mistaken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But she's free to love who she wants, right? Saying that students can't have sex is just nonsense.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, that may be true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man or woman, we're old enough to be married. I don't care at all. Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, you're crying while you're laughing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well if it's about love, it goes without saying. But in Hatano's case⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, there's more?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The man that was with Hatano was old enough to be her father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, you've seen her, haven't you? She's not the kind to fool around.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's tidy, and kinda mysterious, but I think she's cute. Innocent.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, maybe that's why this rumor is widespread.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]If it was about someone who's actually a playgirl, it would not have any value as gossip, would it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you sounding so smart all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh heh. Anyway, that's what's up. It seems that Hatano is quite active with her male acquaintances.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So putting it frankly, she's been with a lot of men.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ There is also the rumor that she has multiple boyfriends.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're gossiping about something as dumb as that? I like to think that I love all the beautiful women of the world equally.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You are called the walking libido, Boss Man⋯ Whoa, I guess I should just call you the libido.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is that better?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh uh⋯ Well as far as Hatano is concerned, it's a rumor, merely a rumor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna⋯ I can't really believe it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But that's what makes gossip so enticing, huh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no, I'm turning into Yuuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean slightly famous?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes⋯ Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're being evasive. Spit it out.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, if you're actually into Hatano, I don't want you to be cross with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you talking around it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There are some dirty rumors about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dirty rumors?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Because of that, she's popular with a certain group of students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, you don't like gossip, Boss Man. That must be why you don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what rumor are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, well, rumor has it that Hatano, the transfer student, is a well known playgirl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You can call her a playgirl or whatever you want, but that's what she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is a playgirl?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, um⋯ If I heard correctly, the girl named Kanna Hatano transferred here just over a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's a moderate student with moderately high marks, mild-mannered, and is slightly lacking in cooperation with others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. You sure know a lot about her even though she's a year above you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes⋯ Well, she is slightly famous among those with poor reputations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A slightly famous person?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Glaring at Yuuki won't help anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to him.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't glare at me like that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You're making me embarrassed.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Yuuki[line]That hurts.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am Yuuki, at your service, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that about?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No matter how much you order me, Mr. Takuya, I will not give you ten yen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will not give you what's in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's in your pocket?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ten yen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't need it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't grip me like that. *blush*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh no, it was just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Enough of this guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Moron.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Actually, my backpack is maroon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called a hoodie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A jacket with a hood on it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you for pointing that out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the only jacket you have, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Didn't I tell you before? I have many of them in the same color and style.[%p]
