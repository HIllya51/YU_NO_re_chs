[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be pointless to go home without doing anything here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give this room a little more boost in entropy![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here we go![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, you're Koudai's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello, Your Highness Headmaster Ryuuzouji Sir.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh, you're just like your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was he doing in the laboratory?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We didn't really get a chance to speak yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, and I don't think we have much to talk about.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just don't really like this guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that anyone's in here, I bet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should practice good manners and always knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, just like I thought. Mitsuki isn't here either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, she was a part time history teacher. She already quit though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like me to be so nervous⋯hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If anyone asks, I'll just have to feign ignorance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just have to hope it isn't about putting makeup on the statue of the chairman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Arima, coming in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I get the wrong laboratory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm sure the announcement said to come to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is definitely the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means whoever called me here hasn't arrived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Zzz⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man, I might fall asleep for real.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The teachers are always telling me to take responsibility, but they don't seem too responsible themselves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're here⋯duh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll have to complain at least once before I feel better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem. Come in.[%p]
[name]Voice[line](It's Arima. I'm coming in.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing here? I-I uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I panicking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, I'm just confused running into Ayumi all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. Yeah, that's it.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well, you know⋯hahaha! Oh, what am I saying?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
