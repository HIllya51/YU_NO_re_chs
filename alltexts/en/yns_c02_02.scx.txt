[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's drunk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's gotten into her?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ow⋯ My headache is killing me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I guess that's why I never drink this much. I'm a lightweight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know how you feel.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oof⋯ Sorry Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to apologize for anything. We're family, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯ Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take you to your room. You should change.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know how Ayumi feels.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](With all this accident trouble on her hands, I'm sure she's at her limit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was an uproar at that briefing, and they really laid into her on that news show.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not even her and it made me want to get a drink.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ow⋯ My headache is killing me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah⋯ I don't have work today, so I cut loose last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just let Ayumi sleep in her bedroom, and then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was there any headache medicine in our house?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to go look for some.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, some headache medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The first aid kit was in the cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's the first aid kit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has two bandages⋯that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is no good. If there's one thing me and the old man had in common, it's that we were super healthy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi never really got sick, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I guess I have to go out to the drugstore to get some meds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I put Ayumi to sleep in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The drugstore⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll be here until I sober up a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, this isn't good. Not here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to get her to the living room for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I just saw you on TV. You looked good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]TV⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, on that show News Presence.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please don't talk about that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'd rather forget all about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. I can see that, considering what happened on the show.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't have mentioned it. It upset her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry⋯ I didn't realize.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehehe, why so serious?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm really happy, you know. What were we talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess logic doesn't really work with drunk people.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It feels so nice and cool on my butt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'll be even cooler without your panties on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like I could ever say that to her.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Take off my panties?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*flinch* (Oh no. I actually said that out loud.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯ Sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why didn't you say so sooner? It's much cooler that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll go ahead and take them off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, that's very nice but⋯ No, just stop.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? Because⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Would it cause trouble for you if I took off my panties? Heh, you're like one of those dang protestors.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* Ayumi is a bit hard to handle right now.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're late, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I was watching TV.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Boys who do nothing but watch TV don't grow up big and strong, you know. *yawn*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh, you reek of alcohol. Have you been drinking?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whaaa? Am I not allowed to get drunk because I'm middle-aged?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one said that. Come on, stand up.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If you let me have a piggyback ride.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Fine. Here, get on my back.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Can you get me some cold water, too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get you some from the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Turn on the fan, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fan?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm hot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Okay, I got it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll take some hot coffee, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put some on.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're so sweet, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I'm flattered.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I bet you'll make a great husband some day. The girl you marry will be so lucky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, come on, stand up.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is a pretty bad drunk I guess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's red⋯ How sexy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, hold up. She's my stepmom.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You talk to yourself a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just ever so slightly red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might not be blackout drunk, but Ayumi never drinks this much.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Am I not allowed to get drunk? That's so unfair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's not what I meant.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So what do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is drunk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't get what I'm talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is a little messed up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's holding it together with her hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's hair⋯ Whoa, you reek of booze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just came from drinking at an izakaya or bar or something, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Am I not allowed to drink? That's so unfair. *sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's not true. I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehehe, what are you getting so bent out of shape for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is drunk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't get what I'm talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's holding back her messy hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's holding back her messy hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's so womanly, even when she's drunk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I probably shouldn't be staring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really shouldn't be staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to bring Ayumi to the living room for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even her chest is a little red.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How sexy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking at that now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was the microwave?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But Takuya, you can't cook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was probably the house next door.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm⋯ Ok.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To be honest, I kind of want to stay like this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no, no. What am I thinking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should probably fix her skirt for her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That seems too direct though⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But even if I say something, will Ayumi understand me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ I just need to bring her to the living room now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it really okay for her skirt to be so turned up though?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ehh⋯your shoes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's plopped right down in the entrance, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess it might be good to cool your hot body⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's legs⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do I need some cleaning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want her to step on me with those shoes so badly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's wearing some really high heels.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must have worn good shoes for the TV recording.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's so attractive about shoes, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These are my shoes. It doesn't matter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I can't leave Ayumi sitting here in the foyer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got to do something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi seems drunk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's sitting in the foyer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't let her keep sitting in the foyer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the entrance to my house.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is plopped right down on the floor.)[%p]
