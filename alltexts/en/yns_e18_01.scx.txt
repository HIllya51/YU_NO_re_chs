[name]Takuya[line]The TV said construction was cancelled.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means it'll be this quiet during the day, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't hear anything but the waves at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There doesn't seem to be anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I figured she'd be here, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna always comes to look at the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction is on hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's odd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's usually a sound of crunching and grinding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like they stopped construction. I wonder what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coast. They're not doing construction any more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened with that lightning accident?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like something's burning. I wonder if it's from the accident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like something's burning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's still under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is still at the office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater to block high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our town is on the right. I guess it's for high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants are growing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass down the stairs here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sand is shining in the sunlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction takes away the refreshing feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a date spot at night before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's so strange though. How could lightning strike when the sky was so clear?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hey! Eavesdropping ain't good, kid.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I said the truck wasn't on fire⋯whoa![%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh, forget what I said just now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I don't know anything about the accident last night.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Get outta here.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder what's gonna happen now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The company had a briefing, right? I heard it got out of hand.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I heard the angry relatives of those who died, and the workers, went off on her.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Who? The one responsible, Chief Arima of course.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]She's got a cute face, but you reap what you sow.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What, it smells like something's burning?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well yeah, a fire broke out. It was from the lightning.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I feel like we were really lucky that it didn't turn into a huge disaster.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That's why I said we shouldn't do it. The lightning seems to be focusing around our transportation work.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's strange though. Why would lightning strike only during transportation work?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The faithful say it's the wrath of the gods.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The folks around here say it was a sea god's wrath or something.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm quitting today or tomorrow, so I don't care.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Recently things have been pretty peaceful.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But there's no telling when lightning could strike again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Why were we even doing the transportation work at night?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I thought this was just a geological survey.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I heard something else happened here last night.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They asked me to come, but I said no because it was going to be overtime work.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They said they were doing the transportation work at night.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh yeah, I wonder what happened at that briefing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I heard things went south pretty quickly.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Huh? What's going on?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]There was another lightning strike.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This is what happens when they force us to continue construction all of the sudden.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Chief Arima is a horrible person. She has no regard for our lives at all.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I think that Chief Arima is pretty cute, but man she's cold.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's like she doesn't give half a damn about any of our lives.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just what's going on with the company's safety standards?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This is life-threatening.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I hope the briefing gets done without a hitch.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Actually, the briefing is about to start in front of the company building.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The family of those who died are going to be there too. Things might get messy.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Chief Arima is finally going to explain things for us, thankfully.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder what she'll have to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck must be for moving earth and sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if they just leave it out here, it'll be bad for the engine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That ocean breeze always blows at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what are they transporting? This is a geological survey, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's for transporting dirt and sand or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This ocean is so beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope the construction finishes soon so I can swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still hot and perfect for the beach, but no one's swimming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because of the construction, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi's in charge of it, so I can't really say much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can faintly hear the whispering of the waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is dark and quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the proper name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost nobody around here calls it that, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the sights of Sakaimachi. It's known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. It's night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright and blue, but it looks gloomy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're not doing construction right now. Maybe because it's night time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But can they even continue construction with all these accidents?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something must have happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it was?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess there was an accident around here somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like there was a fire.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what a geological survey looks like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like they could do it on a smaller scale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the construction site's fence. Apparently they're doing a geological survey inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what I saw from the rooftop, it looked like they're digging up the beach for all its worth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a pretty nice place before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't hear the construction now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the construction is on hold for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All that rumbling from the construction is loud. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet all around. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Oh well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet Ayumi is still at work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, is it okay to go to the office now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's nothing there, I should come right back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only authorized personnel are allowed there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should come back soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make sure Toyotomi doesn't find me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go check out Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make sure that Toyotomi guy doesn't see me.[%p]
