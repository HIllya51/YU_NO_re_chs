[name]Mitsuki[line]It's real.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Why is Mitsuki pointing a gun at us?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're finally awake. Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell is going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, one more question.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer me honestly.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I will if I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can. It's about your feelings, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you really doing this now, because you want to?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can answer that, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I-I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I am⋯ For⋯him⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm asking how you really feel about this.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I⋯ I-I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I knew something was off⋯ Her eyes are empty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like she's somehow hypnotized⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]My head⋯hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I must shoot you, but I don't want to. But I must–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, get a hold of yourself![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! She really took a shot![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]My head⋯hurts. It hurts![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, get out of here while you can![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Where are we supposed to go?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the exit! You'll get shot if you just stand there![%p]
[name]Mio[line]B-But where's the exit?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't want to shoot! My head⋯it hurts!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This way, Mio![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait for me, Takuya![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We ran away so fast⋯we got lost and somehow ended up here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I'm sure you knew where you were going.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Honestly, I also have no idea.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But you brought me here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So you're saying you just found this place by coincidence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Liar. You wouldn't have come here if you didn't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are we looking at? Why is a machine like this underneath Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And this low heavy sound⋯ What is this thing?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's a lightning generator.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Please⋯run.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]M-Ms. Ichijou. What do you mean it's a lightning generator?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha⋯ It's just what I said. It generates lightning, which then strikes people on the coastline.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-That's impossible.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He is a great man⋯ He predicted much about the structure inside of Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But he did say there was one thing he couldn't predict. Dr. Arima's actions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯ Did you hear that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This can't be something as unscientific as a lightning generator.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So what is this device right in front of you? Just a hoax?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh⋯ Aaaaahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hurry⋯go! If you don't, we'll all be dead⋯ Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What's wrong⋯ Ms. Ichijou is acting strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯ He knows. The structure inside Sword Cape⋯ Ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does Ryuuzouji know?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]H-He's changed. When I look into his eyes, I⋯can't⋯control myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I-I can't⋯control myself anymore⋯ Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Watch out! The rocks are falling![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Urgh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Please stop, Ms. Ichijou![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]My head hurts⋯ Aaah!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki seems to be fighting something⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?!)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The exit is⋯over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mio[line]It looks like she passed out. What is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems okay. She's still breathing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hey. Do you feel something tingly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do⋯ My hair is standing up.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're electrically charged.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean, electrically charged?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Being electrically charged means there's electricity passing through something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not what I meant to ask. Why are we electrically charged?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Also⋯ Has that sound gotten louder?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ The humming sound.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Now that you mention it⋯ It's getting louder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's coming⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Coming?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Like⋯what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit⋯ It got me a little.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya! Are you okay?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm not okay. But I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your head's confused.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had a bit of a shock.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What⋯ What is this?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the device is fully operational⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The device is⋯operational?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The voltage is rising, and it's discharging electricity.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like your theory was right, Mio. And what Mitsuki said was right, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As unbelievable as it is, the thing responsible for the lightning strikes is this huge machine.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, this can't be happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The discharges are getting stronger⋯ This is bad.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If we stay here, we'll get fried by the electricity. Let's go back to the lake⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't stand up! It'll strike you![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-Then what should we do?! If we stay here, we'll just get burnt to a crisp![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be something we can do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji is interested in the ore that was glowing under the lake.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so special about that ore?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't answer that. Actually, I should say that I don't know the answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm just helping the headmaster. If the headmaster wants the ore, then it's my mission to bring it to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your mission⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He takes many precautions. If this way doesn't work, he has a backup plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I thought there was something else that Ryuuzouji wanted.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, didn't you know, Mitsuki? He's quite infatuated with a device my father had.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How do you know that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it from Ryuuzouji himself.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're lying. He would never let that slip to anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then maybe it was a Ryuuzouji from a different world.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was the day before yesterday.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I just do what the headmaster tells me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She might not actually know.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she wasn't told.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is there something you want to say, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well first, let me ask you two questions.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll answer if I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, first question. I want to know what Ryuuzouji wants with this underground lake⋯ No, actually, I want to know why he's interested in that glowing ore.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya, he's planning to make the discovery of these ruins his own–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it. Ryuuzouji never planned to make this place's existence public.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that right, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why would you think that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm asking the questions.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well⋯ As you said, the headmaster didn't plan to make this place public, and he's interested in that rare metal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You've put a lot of thought into this. If you thought about your tests this much, you'd get better grades.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're quiet, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm listening intently to your conversation.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not making excuses for Mio, but is Mitsuki working under Ryuuzouji's orders?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does Ryuuzouji want?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he interested in this underground place?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe he would go this far⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a minute.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Didn't Mitsuki say something about that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah⋯ She mentioned something about rare metal⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Rare metals⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki said they're minerals that don't naturally occur in high volumes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's what's making this whole cave glow⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is Ryuuzouji interested in this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is⋯smiling, slightly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ What does this mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, thanks for carrying me. Was I scraping your back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that the handgun?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you at least tell me why?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's wrong⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like I'm in a totally different place⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How do you know that, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio and Mitsuki are arguing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like Mitsuki's cleverly dodging her.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why don't you admit it?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A teacher doesn't lie. Unfortunately, your guess is wrong, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, now I understand! I know what you're trying to do, Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, may I ask what that is?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ryuuzouji is pulling your strings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pulling her strings? Come on, this isn't a gangster movie.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shut up, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's it⋯ Ryuuzouji was one of Dr. Arima's colleagues.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Colleagues⋯ They started in the same place and followed the same path.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But Dr. Arima began to distinguish himself from the rest.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]People called him a heretic, but Dr. Arima was honored to be called that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ryuuzouji jealously watched his colleague grow.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So, he wanted to make this amazing discovery his own⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The theory in the book, 「Legacy」 was his. He believed he had the proof all to himself.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Neither Dr. Arima nor Professor Imagawa existed in this world any longer. They say the dead tell no tales.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And now that Takuya and I know that secret, especially since Takuya is Dr. Arima's son⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]He could no longer allow Takuya to continue to existence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's awful⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So now Takuya and I have to die here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Bravo.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I knew it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Other than the name, Ryuuzouji, you got everything wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh. So she was 99 percent wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shut up, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm impressed with your imagination. You were almost entirely wrong, but it was impressive.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph! Well, you can claim anything.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ I suppose I can.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you going to do to us?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I know the rare metal is here now, and I know how to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you were just pretending to sleep in that room with the skeleton? You were pretty cute too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, thanks.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya, is this really the time to flirt?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you going to do to us?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm sorry, you two. I understand no one can know the secret of this place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What about us?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll leave that to your imagination.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't believe it! Ms. Ichijou⋯ It's impossible![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Teachers don't lie.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It seems this great discovery will be yours alone, Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A great discovery⋯mine alone⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not the truth though. Takuya and I found this place together first.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I already knew this place existed. I was just confirming my suspicions.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha⋯ However, I didn't know where the entrance was, so you've been very helpful, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The gun Ryuuzouji had⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't make any sudden moves. I don't want to shoot you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh. I feel like I've seen this before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That gun⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gun?)
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Ryuuzouji's gun?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes⋯ That's right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait. What is this? Why do you have Ryuuzouji's gun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does this mean that Ryuuzouji is controlling Mitsuki⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh come on, that's a lighter, isn't it? I can tell.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, it's a little hot for a lighter. It blows fire.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You can't be serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something is definitely not right here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on⋯with Mitsuki?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio looks serious⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio looks really serious⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This situation⋯doesn't seem like a joke.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be looking there!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what are you looking at?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is facing off against Mitsuki⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing I can do against a gun⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I like how straightforward you are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe. You're as frank as always.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would everyone stop pressuring me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be looking at Mitsuki's perfect lower body.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki⋯ What are you doing pointing that gun at us?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ It seems you're interested in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The lake is shimmering with a pale light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe this place is under Triangle Mountain.)[%p]
