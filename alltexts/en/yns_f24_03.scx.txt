[name]Kaori[line]So? Where would you break in from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if it were me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't break in through the light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Through this light⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Through the light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem! Next.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to climb the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I were to break in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh my, you sound confident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a wall.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the bottom part of the light. It has nothing to do with anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of the light post, I think.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's your break-in route?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. I was just checking.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My break-in route is⋯ Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯ Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, the sign isn't the place you should break in from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics Japan Geological Engineering Laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a sign.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Teehee, do you give up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Past the gate and⋯then where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Past the gate⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, that's a good start. Past the gate and⋯then where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like you said, Kaori. There's no one in the guard house.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. Looks like no one's here, just like I expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I bet they're holding a security meeting or something inside. How stupid. Hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antenna. I don't need that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll turn into radio waves and break in through here![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you really want to do this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Just give me a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A place to break in from? If it were me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me say condom.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You just said it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dome! Right, the dome!!![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What about the dome?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't that dome look like corn?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Corn?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Meaning, a corn-dome. Which sounds like?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be so dumbfounded. I know, not from here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. I wonder if you can figure it out, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going inside that building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you know what you should do to break into that building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The guards aren't here now. Which means⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go up this hill⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, past the gate, up the hill, and?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Climb up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The route to break in won't be written on the notice board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You can look there, but the secret entrance won't be written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wasn't the rear entrance. Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hide in those trees, and sneak in through the rear entrance![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm. That's perceptive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, am I right?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Until last night you were.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I broke in through the rear entrance last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You broke in through the rear entrance last night?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup. But I'm sure they've tightened security there tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. Give up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it's not the rear entrance⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a bird, so from the sky is impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'd break in from the sky![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wow, how?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From the sky.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]How?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next, next![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't get in from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you plan to break in from there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, not from here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you being serious?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'd go right through the front entrance.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, bingo![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We have two types of security cards in our hands. The regular one, and the blue one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There's no need for us to go in through the back like criminals. Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may be right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This company building is an all-automated, intelligent building, for better or worse. We'll show them just how blind their electronic eyes are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So let's just walk in through the front door. The only thing to hinder us is an electronic lock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's finally time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what they're doing in there.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you really plan to go in through the front door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you taking this seriously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
