[name]Takuya[line]This place is so damp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ My sense of direction keeps getting more and more warped.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's a fork in the path up ahead, if I remember correctly.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How long have I been walking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm certain I've gone really far by now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My sense of direction is completely off. I wonder where I am.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We might be at the bottom of the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Did I say something?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder where we are on the map.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Whew, I'm starting to get tired⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wanna take a break?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thanks, but I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's more the mental stress that's tiring me out than the walking. I don't think it'll go away as long as we're down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mental stress⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The damp air, a dark cave⋯and everything is so uncomfortably close.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be crazy if this didn't stress you out⋯)[%p]
