[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I come to the infirmary, Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Guess I'll get out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Je t'aime![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Ms. Eriko's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a useless teacher. Is she just walking around somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I'll come back later.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Wow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So? Are you surprised?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I always seem to end up here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* What a hopeless student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be off then.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, it's you again. You're in and out of here a lot. You must be busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nah, I just wanted to see your face.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's something you'd say to your girlfriend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk! She dodged that one well.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ichijou isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see that. See ya.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh. It's you again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just thought Ms. Ichijou might be here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Unfortunately not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. See you around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* Where could she have gone?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary seems kind of hazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The scents of disinfectant, nicotine, and tar all mixed together smell disgusting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This smell is making me gag.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]All right. That's enough of that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can't have you puking there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's puking?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]All the cigarette smoke is making my eyes water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nice.[%p]
