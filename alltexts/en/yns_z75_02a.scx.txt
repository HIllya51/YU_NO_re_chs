[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I just hope that the key person doesn't show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean the priestess?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Basically, all I have to do is kill the priestess, but⋯ I do not know who the priestess is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He doesn't know about Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Regardless, this is going to end soon. It is just a matter of time before Dela Grante collides⋯ Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]So, he's the cause of all this evil?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You idiot! Why did you come?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Because you said if you didn't come back after a few minutes, come help⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Are you the key person?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Who are you?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Answer me. Are you the key person?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, what is he saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯ Where is Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What? She is waiting outside. If I don't come back after a few minutes, she is going to come help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So, Yu-No is outside.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Answer me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah, I don't know who the key person is, but I'm the amazing Miss Amanda.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Amanda, no! Ahhh–[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Be quiet, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You! Let her go![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Okay⋯ Well, come over here then.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Let go of that woman first.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh, all right. I will as soon as you come over here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Dimensional hall activated, all transferees to the center table.))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, come over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't go, Amanda! Something's wrong![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing is wrong. This is what an integrated computer should look like.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If I go, you'll release that woman, right?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Of course⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll be fine. Catch him off guard and help her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I am not as stupid as he thinks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She will be fine. Now, hurry.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hah hah hah⋯ Well priestess, this is farewell.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm getting sucked in⋯it's pulling me in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda! I'm coming![%p]

[name]Takuya[line]What did you do to Amanda?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The priestess who can move Dela Grante is no longer here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He thought Amanda was the priestess.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Don't worry. I won't kill unnecessarily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by that?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Just think of it as throwing rubbish down the trash shoot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Dela Grante and your world are coming extremely close to each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, we're located near my world?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We are not talking about the physical location. It's merely about the dimension level.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to Amanda?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If that priestess was lucky, she would have fallen into your world by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda fell⋯into my world?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If she is not lucky, she will drift forever between the dimensions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ Holy shit.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]However, that might be more convenient for her because Dela Grante will disappear due to event collision.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Along with your world⋯ Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ Muahahaha⋯ There's no surviving now. There is no priestess. There is no engineer who can move Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I can finally escape⋯ I can't wait to entrust my body to the waves of event elements for tens of thousands of years once again.[%p]

[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've been tricked⋯haha⋯ Even I thought the key person was gone.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Gaaahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What happened?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hhmmmm⋯ Raaaaahh⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Another consciousness is⋯disturbing my⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Grantia's consciousness? No, this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's happening⋯to Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You⋯ I see. You![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hhrmm⋯ I thought you were swallowed by the wave of events and died⋯ Gaaahhh![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Get out of my head![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhhhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What is this?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, get back![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Raaaaahh!!![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]To hell with you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ryuuzouji's⋯ No. Could it be the true identity of the guy who took his body?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Grr⋯ But you can't defeat me like this.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Even if my temporary body perishes, I have infinite time⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]There is no infinite time![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What?![%p]

[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Grrrrr!!!
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Gaaaaahh!!!
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone is⋯walking towards us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seems like I made it in time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He's gone⋯and will never appear again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck is going on?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ryuuzouji⋯ No, the guy who took Ryuuzouji's body was a being of pure consciousness.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]As long as it was inside the body, he could never be beat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as it was inside the body⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. This gun is specially made to kill that guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But even with this gun, I could not beat him unless he detached his consciousness from the body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And Ryuuzouji detached his consciousness⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes. Therefore, he will never appear in this world again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it over⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]At least, for him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Good, you're safe.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji was trying to kill you. You're safe⋯ What's the matter?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ The God-Monarch is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh! Yes, Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's on the floor! Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Are you okay, Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Blood⋯ She's bleeding⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's blood everywhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ryuuzouji⋯did this to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯ He really had a dagger.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't speak⋯ Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It has been five years already⋯since I came to this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Five years⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](One year longer than me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Some kind of influence occurred, or⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I thought that you would come someday, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'm here now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ryuuzouji came here three years before I did.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He was using the Grand Monarch to reign over this country.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]And when I learned his purpose⋯ I ousted him and became the current God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm a terrible woman. A nasty woman scheming and plotting as if nothing were wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you're not⋯ I know you very well and you're no such person.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hah, hah⋯ I always liked you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Stop it, don't use the past tense![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]When I discovered the secret of this world, I was at a loss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I tried searching whether there was a way to save both worlds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I understand.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I was merely a speaker that projected the words of the God-Monarch. Yet people in this country have deified me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I had no one to talk to⋯ There were nights when I cried from the loneliness.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I was hoping maybe you might come⋯ That thought got me through it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's just, my eyelids are starting to feel a little heavy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But⋯that person⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That person⋯came to help me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What person⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I wanted to see that person just one more time⋯ But I am happy to we got to meet again⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What are you saying, Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I feel cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll warm you up.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hold me tight⋯so much that I might fall into pieces.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ I'll hold you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A drop of⋯ Ah, it's so warm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you crying⋯for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not crying. It's a little bit hot, so I'm sweating.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sweating from your heart?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please⋯ Yu-No is going to save our world⋯ Ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't talk anymore.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please⋯ Takuya⋯ Save our⋯world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I promise.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe I have lived⋯my life⋯just for this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe this is my destiny⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! This isn't it![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People have the right to be happy, and we shouldn't neglect our efforts to become happy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ You sound like that person⋯ Hah hah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no such thing as a human being living life just to die.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's warm. Takuya⋯your hand⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hold my hand really tight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't⋯leave me⋯alone⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't like the cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]AYUMI?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's dead⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's dead!!!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Are you crying⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you calling me a crybaby?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In my world, the only time a man can cry is when he drops his wallet⋯and when his mother dies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm glad this is one of those.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's okay to shed tears for those you love.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She may have been happy because she saw you crying for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's no way to be happy![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She just⋯loved that old bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She only stayed because she got involved in all this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All alone here for years⋯ Withstanding the solitude⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was her destiny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her destiny? Knock it off. I don't believe in that kind of crap.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
*sob*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got something in my eyes.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you need to cry, too?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Your sorrow is my sorrow. I want to accept⋯all of your suffering and pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I am sorry to butt in during the middle of a good conversation, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There is something you and Yu-No have to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm sorry about your mother. It was unfortunate. However, sometimes unavoidable events happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying it was destiny?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Seems like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. There is no such thing as destiny! We design our future ourselves, don't we?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're satisfied because the enemy of your lover is gone![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I couldn't⋯ Ayumi is–[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, you are going to cry forever?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Even now, destiny is waiting for us. And it is coming closer, each and every second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wonder if your pessimistic sorrow is what she really wanted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Think once more about what she passed on to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We only have a little time.[%p]

[name]Eriko[line]What? Just 910 seconds?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shhh⋯ We will receive a warning.[%p]

[name]Eriko[line]T-minus 910 seconds to entry and 910 seconds to synchronization⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does 「synchronization」 mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's the time left before Yu-No can move Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, 「entering the limit radius」 means?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's time for Dela Grante and your world to approach a definitely unavoidable distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a warning?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a cautionary notice. It's simple subtraction. Try it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]T-minus 910 seconds to entering the limit radius, 910 seconds to synchronization⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is this our destiny, too⋯? No time left now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wish there was more time for the sync, even one more second⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Merely a second, yet a second can be more than enough. It only takes a moment for the universe to disappear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it, Yu-No?[%p]

[name]Yu-No[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Whoa![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It started⋯ When the priestess walked in, the final program was activated![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The final program⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Grantia's consciousness will be here once again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's descending upon the integrated computer, Grand Monarch, in order to link with Yu-No![%p]

[name]Eriko[line]Calm down. The device has been activated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The device has⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There are only 10 more minutes left. It's time to make up your mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not you, Yu-No, it's too dangerous.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We will die either way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's true, but⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((T-minus 600 seconds until entering the limit radius⋯))[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Less than 10 minutes now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gaah! Come on![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yu-No⋯ Why are you naked?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The God-Monarch told me how to perform the ritual. It's time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not possible![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ There is no other way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, which one of you is the kid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stay out of our family business![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, listen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it! This can't be happening![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We talked about this already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I changed my mind.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just a stubborn old man. No means no![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, please⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What? Even if you look at me like that, it's still a no.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ If something happens to me, you're going to help me, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm not afraid because I have you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm sure you will come to help me⋯ I believe so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I believe in you, Dad⋯ I can be strong, because I can believe in someone that I love.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm okay⋯ I'll see you again, Dad. I just know it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'm sure I'll see you⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry. I feel bad about getting upset⋯ Even though you're in the toughest position⋯ I'm such a⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Come help me, please⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, I will. For sure. I promise.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Really.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Don't forget about me⋯[%p]

[name]Eriko[line]That's what was written on Vrinda's Tree, until now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But then, what will happen to Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]From the mechanism of the dimensional synchronization system, both the body and soul will be blown out of this dimension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯? You told me she will be safe.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't remember saying that⋯ I mean, she does have a 10 billion to one chance of surviving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't be serious![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Her body on the event element wave will approach the speed of the event element, and eventually will exceed it. At that time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At that time⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She will probably retrace the order of events.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The order of events⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just like a tachyon exceeding the speed of light goes back to the past.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happens then?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Only god knows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But how could⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This time, the energy value is incomparable to anything that's ever happened. A cataclysmic event shock will occur.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She trusts you. Why would you break that trust?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you have the Reflector?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, yeah.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You might be able to return to your original dimension with that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I am not sure, but there is a possibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hand a Jewel to her. Just one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To Yu-No⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When she drifts across the dimensions and needs your help⋯ It may come in handy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have to go now⋯ I will be forced to return to my world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're leaving⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry I couldn't help you⋯ There aren't enough words for a real apology.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop. You don't need to kiss up to me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya⋯ Never lose hope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course. I ain't no quitter.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hah hah, that's the spirit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, don't smoke too much.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't think I can quit⋯ Hah, hah. I experienced the culture and customs of your world, and I've changed a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did your boobs get bigger?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, maybe. Man, what I wouldn't give for a nap on a hard floor after this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hard floor?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, lengthy dimensional navigation makes me want to touch something hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh, w-well⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm glad to have met you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So am I.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I want to see you again⋯if I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's always a chance that we'll see each other in a parallel world.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* Bye now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko has left⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What remains here is me, and⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just the two of us⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take this.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's pretty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you pray, use this Jewel.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Thank you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter what happens, I'll find you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how long it takes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I exist⋯ I promise.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I miss those days when we lived together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me too.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Just me, living with Mom and Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I wish we could live together again⋯the three of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a small request⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I couldn't even give Yu-No a normal, happy life.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Running around the field together, collecting nuts, swimming in the river, sleeping together on the grass⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯and sleeping between you and Mom at night. I miss those days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll be able to do all that again. Someday⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I believe so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So do I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Ahhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No!!![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait for me⋯ Even if you get torn out of this dimension, I will⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No!!![%p]
