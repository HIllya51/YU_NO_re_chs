[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, tell me your side of the story.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I have the right to know. I came all the way here, after all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to her.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, I just want to go home and examine those documents. I want to grab some literature and research this historic discovery together![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, that's not a bad idea.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are we going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, well it's just you and I trapped down here together⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You'll be sorry if you try anything funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I meant was that we need to split up and look for an exit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's obvious that would make searching twice as fast.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]R-Right⋯ Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what did you mean by trying something funny?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apparently if I try something funny I won't get away with it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, something funny⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, like what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahahah, I win.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're so stupid. You don't have the guts to try something like that anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's just split up and look for a way out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't change the subject.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't make such a big deal about it. If we got in, there has to be a way for us to get out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Logic would lead me to assume so.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll go look over there. Takuya, you should start over where you came from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She sure left in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seemed like she didn't want to look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she feel guilty about something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, we have to find the exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just like Mio said. We came in here, so there has to be a way out⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There has to be⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm pretty hungry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talking will only make you hungrier.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I couldn't find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Find what? A cause for celebration?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't even have the energy to be mad at you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've collapsed from exhaustion after searching for the exit. I wonder how long it's been?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ I don't think a full day has passed yet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's way too broad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but I'm not wrong.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I shouldn't have walked around so much⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say that. At the very least, we found out there's no exit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If there was never an exit to begin with, it would have been better to not waste our energy looking for one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hindsight is 20/20.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're right, but our search turned up nothing. That's why I'm so frustrated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you always think so negatively?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If thinking positive would save us, I'd be a ray of sunshine all day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your stomach sounds so cute.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh! Don't listen to it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say women are stronger against famine, you know. Because they have more bodyfat.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who are you calling fat?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know⋯ If I don't yell at you, I feel like I'm going to go crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's get back to searching after we take a break.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah⋯ Okay. We should.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is bad⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think Mio is already nearing her physical limit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This time I have to find the exit⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But searching every nook and cranny in a place this big⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm feeling light-headed⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't good⋯)
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't try telling me everything's perfectly fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The way back is sealed off, and there's no way forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just knew we wouldn't be able to find it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's hindsight talking, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well that's how things ended up, so I'm right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Fighting here isn't going to solve anything⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're both exhausted. I don't want to make either of us any more tired⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio seems to be getting mentally exhausted⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not doing too bad yet. I'm just a little hungry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd like to cheer her up somehow, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that creepy smile?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want to see my family crest?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your family crest? Like a house sigil?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup. The crest for the House of Arima.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're gonna do something dumb, huh. You don't have to explain it any more. I'm tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, you'll feel better when you see this⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No! Don't say it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Behold the Bare Crest of the House of Arima!」 Ha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feeling better?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You made me even more tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehehe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You were just trying to cheer me up, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who knows⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You failed, by the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to keep searching for the exit⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's no point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We already looked everywhere⋯ There's no way we're going to find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's a hidden passage? Think about the path we used to get here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wouldn't be that surprising if there was some trick like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, then let me ask you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If there was a hidden passage, what would you do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Turn over every single rock to find it? This place is like five times bigger than the school grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's physically inconceivable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Chances aren't zero though.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's pretty much zero.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's still a chance. But, if we just sit around here doing nothing, our chances of finding a way out really will be zero.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't say everything will be okay, but we have to do what we can.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We got in, so there has to be a way out.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're really strong, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strong as an ox, you might say?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have a lot of mental fortitude too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's strange how you can stay so calm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not though. I'm sweating.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe⋯it doesn't look like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because I don't think too much about it. Deep down, I'm a simple guy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, Takuya, you believe we'll be saved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I certainly hope so.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's the secret to your strength?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that I'm strong, necessarily. People who can't believe in their own efforts are just doomed.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an exit. There has to be. I believe that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay. Sorry for being such a downer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it. I understand why you'd feel like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should rest here. It'd be best for you to not move around too much.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to step up and handle this like a man. I'll be back soon.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]See you later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll find it. I'll definitely find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not being silent because I blame you for anything. I'm just exhausted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry to worry you⋯ I'm sorry I wasn't able to find it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's okay. You're doing your best⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not my best unless I get results⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Can we talk for a minute?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wanted to ask you something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, ask me anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That paper⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Paper?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]On the school bulletin board. Did you really put that up there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh boy⋯ How am I supposed to answer that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her Yuuki did it, it'll sound like I'm passing the buck.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Besides, he feels bad enough about it. I don't want to make him feel any worse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His anxiety is bad enough as it is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Would you answer me? Was it really you⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I did it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You said you didn't do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Back then, you said you didn't do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just what came out of my mouth.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I just gave into the temptation to lie. I'm really sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sorry, Takuya⋯ I just figured you would say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It was Yuuki, wasn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯ No! Did he say that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No. I realized it when I talked to him though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You could see the guilt all over his face. He's not the kind of person that can do bad things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki is a good guy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ I'm glad you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe, you like to take care of your juniors, don't you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really. I just don't want you to get the wrong idea about Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Will you come over here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like next to you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What's up?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you want⋯to kiss?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kiss? Like in billiards when the balls barely touch?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh⋯ Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-It's not that I don't want to.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to know why. What's the reason?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you really need a reason to kiss?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Absolutely! A man and a woman loving each other is a sacred act.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe⋯ Haha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're completely hopeless when it comes to this stuff, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now I'm in trouble⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My theory is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So⋯that's why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The long and short of it is that Triangle Mountain is actually a stone monument made in ancient times⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't deny that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There seems to be more to it though⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to gather my thoughts together⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line](This all started when I met that woman⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She appeared where my old man told me to go, then disappeared right in front of my eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](After that⋯pretty much everything around me changed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like a giant hole opened up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The passage beneath Triangle Mountain goes very deep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I came down chasing after Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Inside, the passage only went one way⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It just kept going on. Everything was humid and wet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes the paths split⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There were a couple dead ends⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's when I found those sculptures, if you could call them that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I found them down there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was a rock engraving there with the face of a demon carved into it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then, there was the crown engraving.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And an impenetrable door.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They were the keys to unlocking it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The crown and the demon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What meaning could they possibly have?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was some kind of small burial chamber beyond it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](With two dead bodies inside⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was also a staircase in the sarcophagus⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What exactly is this place?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this place⋯? What was its purpose⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I never thought ruins like this would exist underneath Triangle Mountain.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And this was the final resting place of my old man's acquaintance, Professor Imagawa.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](In her notes, she said the ruins are more than 8,000 years old.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](More than 8,000 years⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's beyond what I can imagine.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You weren't listening to a single thing I said, were you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was listening. You were saying something about how Triangle Mountain is actually a stone monument made in ancient times, right? Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yeah, but what's with the 「maybe」 at the end?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem. You must have heard me wrong. I didn't say that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, I was listening.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well then, now it's your turn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Didn't you say you had something else to tell me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I believe the civilization here is completely different from any other ancient civilization.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean, a different civilization?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like it possesses something that can't be explained by modern science.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Interesting. Did you find evidence to support your theory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll explain everything once we get out of here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Seriously? Is it⋯somehow related to your father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man? I guess you could say that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What was Dr. Arima researching?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you know more about that than I do.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've only read two or three of his books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That should do it. I haven't read a single one. Just kind of flipped through 'em.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Professor Imagawa wrote about something called the Hypersense Stone in her notes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It also said that she was analyzing it with Dr. Arima's wife⋯meaning your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, is that so?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Apparently. What does your stepmother do, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you being like that? This is your own family we're talking about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That old bastard was never around, and Ayumi never talks about her work at home. I never really asked about it, either.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Doesn't she work for Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think they do geological research or something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't really thought much about it, just so you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I was just thinking about something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About why your boobs are so small?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They're not that small![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then how big are they?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]According to the measurements I took the other day⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What measurements?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya, do you have any interest in taking this seriously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I sure am interested in something, I'll tell you that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh⋯ You're giving me a headache. I'm talking about these ruins.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ruins?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't they look like the ancient mounds left by the Native Americans?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! Looks like that historian blood of yours is beginning to boil.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't make fun of me. Do you know what mounds are?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's where the pitcher throws the ball from.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay. They're kinda like a pyramid. The indigenous peoples of America made them, I think.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm impressed. Some had tons of human bones, inside those hollowed out mounds of rock and dirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The one here at Sword Cape is comparatively small. The mounds in Illinois are as large as 10 square kilometers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wow, she's really done her homework.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't they look similar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess you could say that, but⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that 「but」 at the end?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a contradictory conjunction. There are two points here that don't add up.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Care to explain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mounds in America that are thought to be ruins were built around 1,000 B.C.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Were they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You read Professor Imagawa's notes, right? She said this was over 8,000 years old. That's around 6,000 B.C. There's about a 5,000 year difference.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's enough time for two or three different civilizations to come and go.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That may be true, but⋯ What about Stonehenge in England?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know a lot of useless crap, don't you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Those huge rocks were placed in a circle. This civilization seems to be based on rocks, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stonehenge is said to be from 2,000 B.C. That still leaves a 4,000 year gap.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, you do make a good point. It's a civilization system based on stonework.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most civilizations of ancient Japan were based on lumber. Rocks might actually make a big difference here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You can be oddly smart about the strangest things, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that in a nice way, ya know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So tell me the other thing. You said there were two reasons, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before that, let me hear your theory. It has to do with something about Triangle Mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think Professor Imagawa was going after the secret of Sword Cape itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're talking about those notes that ended up being her final words?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said something similar once, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I thought that the civilization called the Celestials were somehow related to Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, are you talking about the people that came to Japan around the year 400?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The people who united Japan under Yamato.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, it turns out that it wasn't the year 400 at all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If Professor Imagawa's findings are correct, this discovery could change the entire history of Japan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will mean that this place was built long before any recorded evidence of human civilization. It might even be before the ark.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Investigating this with a large team could reveal the mysteries of the Japanese people⋯ No, maybe of humankind itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is getting pretty crazy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No joke. 8,000 years ago⋯ That's 6,000 B.C.? I'm getting dizzy just trying to think about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because you're looking at it from the point of view of human civilization. Compared to the history of the whole universe⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯8,000 years would pass in a blink of an eye. Dr. Arima said that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I was the one who said it first. He just copied me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who cares?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care, not at all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahem. Anyway, there's no doubt that this is a great historical discovery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we make it out of here, that is.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You got some kind of plan?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Isn't that your role in all this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So if we say that tower is Triangle Mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you think something as tall as Triangle Mountain could be man-made?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, just look at what we found underneath this mountain. A lot of it looks man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what's with that light and all the suffering people?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you forget about the accidents that happened around here recently?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The accidents⋯ It can't be.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you think they're a little too similar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That tapestry is at least 400 years old. Those lightning incidents just started happening recently.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not sure about their causal relationship, but don't you think it could be a prophecy of some sort?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's some occult stuff. There's no proof, so it isn't a very scientific assumption.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, the theory of relativity is just a theory, right? There's no definitive proof of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what they call gibberish.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Logical gibberish. Building theory upon theory is what creates logic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmph, it's like I'm talking to my old man.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you think people thought about the Copernican theory at first?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They said it was a crazy idea and that supporters of the theory were demon possessed and should be executed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That has nothing to do with this.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's the same thing. What about those that proposed the existence of viruses? People laughed at them. How about the theory of flight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay. I get it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Free thought and the construction of hypothesis are the basis of science, aren't they? It's less scientific to be wrapped up in preconceived conservative notions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then let me hear your theory on it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Where should I begin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯ How about your body measurements?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, seriously?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I was really shocked to discover what happened to Professor Imagawa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's not even listening to me⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I had heard she disappeared, but I never thought she'd be down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've been following her steps for a long time now. I always wanted to be a top scientist like her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you remember when Kanna was looking at something in front of Sword Cape? There were knife carvings there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That was done by Professor Imagawa. I read in one of her books that when she had no way of writing down her discovery, she would carve a sign somewhere to mark it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would she carve a sign there? Well, there's only one reason⋯ That's where I got in, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did you know that was the entrance?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The tapestry I saw at Ryuuzouji's place convinced me. There had to be something at the foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that tapestry seemed very significant. Wasn't it from like 400 years ago?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. Don't you think it looks like something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The tapestry⋯ Like what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A tower that looks like a craggy mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The bright light coming down from the tower, the people below suffering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get it. But isn't that too big of a leap?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're not talking about some suspicious prophecy. Just because it's similar doesn't mean you should be so quick to connect the two.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's a little too conservative on your part. Science is all about figuring out the inevitable similarities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're not inevitable, they're coincidental.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How can you say they're a product of coincidence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because they're not inevitable.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well then, I think they're not coincidental.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]C'mon, this isn't an argument between two little kids.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just think about it. A tapestry passed down generations in a mansion right near Sword Cape. It has to be considered inevitable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this Triangle Mountain and that tower are one and the same?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with this lake, anyway?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a pale, blue light coming out of it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not coming from the lake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you already look into it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The lake itself isn't giving off light. It looks like a bunch of stones at the bottom are emitting it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stones, huh? I wonder if electricity is running through them.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I should have thought you'd say something like that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't know though. I know of bacteria that produce light, but I've never heard of stones that do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you've just never heard of them. Regardless, they exist right here in front of us.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I guess you're right. But it's just so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stones that emanate light naturally.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stones?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mio's hand. She's brushing back her hair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such soft hands⋯ Her skin is so pale and beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mio's hand. She's lifting up her long hair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe she went exploring in such a thin layer of clothes.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, your clothes are dirty. Just a little though.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, I was going to change, but then I got trapped in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her clothes are pretty dirty in spots.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must have walked all over the place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop staring⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Forget about that. Now is the time to talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, her thighs are pretty exposed⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which makes me happy⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what am I, some kind of ravenous wolf?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Isn't there something I need to be doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if⋯she isn't wearing a bra?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I am wearing a bra.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh⋯ Takuya, you'll never change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. The eyes are naturally attracted to beautiful things, you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she being quiet now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're unexpectedly⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Unexpectedly what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-Nothing, never mind. Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Unexpectedly big.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-They're surprisingly⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Surprisingly what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind. It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She'd kick my ass to the stars if I said they were surprisingly big.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said she got a little dirty⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'm impressed, she doesn't look dirty at all, she⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so shiny it looks like it might sparkle.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm all dirty right now, so please don't look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like she wants to talk about something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't read her expression.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't look happy, but then again she doesn't look sad. She's not mad, either.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, she must be starving!)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya, why do you look so excited?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're inside a cavern.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The light from the lake makes the walls shine in pale blue.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're inside a cavern.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could there be an exit?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's right hand⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is resting on her thigh⋯)[%p]
