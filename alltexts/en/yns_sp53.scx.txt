[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I thought I was going to die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can someone really cross that desert on foot in a week?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I find myself thinking that this was a terrible idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Either way, it feels like the wind has been taken out of my sails.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to get excited about crossing a huge desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I don't feel like doing anything today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go home, take a dump, and then sleep dammit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man. I'm really starting to get dizzy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back and forth, back and forth. What am I even doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I'd love to chug down some water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Water⋯ I need⋯water⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My throat⋯is so dry⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place with water![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯ Celes?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The water tank outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you get out of my way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This one's broken, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it for the drinking water, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe you've done this! We need that drinking water.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you not want me to go that badly?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said you came from the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it going to cause problems for you if I go?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or are you worried something is going to happen to me?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going to happen?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Silent at the most important times. It can't be helped when you don't talk, I guess.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unfortunately for you, this place has plenty of water. There is a river in the forest.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, there's no guarantee it'll be drinkable. I just need to do something right now.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I've already made up my mind.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, can you get out of the way?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]((Wait!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm just mentally exhausted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once I get to the Imperial Capital, I'll find a way to contact you. I doubt there will be a phone.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's still lots of food in storage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough for you to live by yourself for a while, at least.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I've already made up my mind.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. I've made my decision.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't possibly stay here with her forever.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to find my way home, and she needs to learn to live on her own.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What other option is there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what are you looking all around for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just said I wanted to go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet. Maybe because it's night time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's making me long for home even more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A house made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Celes made it home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a house in the middle of a rather large field.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until about a week ago, a knight named Illia was living there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is quite difficult to pile up these stones, though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she do this all by herself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the surface of the stone, it seems like there are thin layers of moss⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see very well because it's dark out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A plant that emits smoke when you touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just letting you know, I'm not going to touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm so homesick that I don't even want to see it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Celes made it home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back for today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, I really don't think I'll be able to find the way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came from that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me feel any worse than I already do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're gonna go inside, just open the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only Celes and I living here. No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. Let's try doing something less silly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, and here I am trying to tell you how down I feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're in now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sprays out smoke. We really shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Touching this will make it spit out smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In this past week, I've experienced so much that I'm getting sick of it.[%p]
