[name]Takuya[line]Huh? She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just saw her in front of the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that teacher doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As usual, Ms. Eriko is not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That teacher's got a case of wanderlust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is now in a regular staff meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the school infirmary, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it, where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where she went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no reason for Ayumi to check out the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means Ayumi is not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is never here. Is she really the school physician?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯there aren't any wadded up tissues thrown away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ew, could this red-stained cloth be⋯could it be what I think it is?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably just gauze used to wipe away a cut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell was I expecting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's gauze and tape thrown away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's only natural, considering it's the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A chair. Ms. Eriko probably uses this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko's clothes and physician's coat are left here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's also left her underwear⋯ Talk about a steamy scene.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ Where did that teacher go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is something hanging on the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey. This is Ms. Eriko's physician's coat and her clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And⋯her underwear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I shouldn't let this distract me. The problem is, why are Ms. Eriko's clothes and underwear left here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal chair. A five-legged chair is a thing of beauty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko sits here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't have any particular scent to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What particular scent would I be sniffing for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any plans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯ Female students have their measurements taken at the beginning of the second semester in September, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should write the dates down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish she'd just sit here and listen to all my sexual frustrations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'd probably kick me out, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where Ms. Eriko works.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be doing all kinds of work here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A vent⋯it lets air in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a vent for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels nice and cool on my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's open. Which means no one's sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When someone is using the bed, this is always closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Use the bed? What do they use it for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I napped a lot here my first and second years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Recently I've been spending my time on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Since the curtains are open, it's easy to deduce that no one's using the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess you don't need a detective to see that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The window is closed because the AC is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold air is coming out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold air is flowing out. The AC must be on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that feels good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the AC's actuator.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you open this, you can see the fan inside spinning around like a washing machine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to open it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is where air flows through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a vent for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels nice and cool on my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shelf full of medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me take a peek inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup, nothing but medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet there's medicine and first aid supplies inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medicine box. Don't find much use for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's anything I am, it's healthy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medicine box full of medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel nauseous right now, and I don't have a headache.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one way to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could just throw a chair at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is set in the frame, so I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An empty school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I dawdling around for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A memo board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, back to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I will apologize to Mio casually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just say it casually. Nothing formal. All right, let's go find Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, let's go back to the main hall.[%p]
