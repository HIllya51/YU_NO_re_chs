[name]Takuya[line]It's been four years already. This hill hasn't change at all⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told Yu-No not to walk outside alone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This hill still has a nice view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's look for Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things haven't changed much in four years. Maybe due to the fact that there are no seasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of trees, fields all around, and a desert that lies beyond all of that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still undeniably a beautiful view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I need to do something other than stare at this forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place with such vibrant trees is a treasure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A seemingly endless desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was called the Rafaelo Desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposedly as hot as hell itself. I don't have any business going there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see our house all the way back there, to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the right. That small house is ours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Celes is cleaning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be taking a nap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have so much stuff to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been a daily habit of mine to think about things here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been four years. Eating, sleeping, and getting horny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this isn't the time for naps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I really be climbing a tree?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I? Some kind of monkey?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't sleep up in a tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are we going back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No should be looking for nuts and fruit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alright, let's go back to the forest.[%p]
