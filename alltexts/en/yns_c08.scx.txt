[name]Takuya[line]Mio comes here a lot, so I thought Yuuki would be here, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to the laboratory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this strange feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I just barely managed to squeeze in through a tight entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I kind of feel like I'm not the same person as before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel a little dizzy too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, what's wrong? What are you doing here so late?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A teacher called me in.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What did you do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not a very nice thing to say. Hey! I'm almost totally innocent.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't think there's anyone left in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're working pretty late.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We don't seem to have many opportunities to speak during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I want to talk to you about something. Do you have time now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For me⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. Please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We shouldn't stand around here and talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want to sit down on one of the desks?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Doesn't look like the guidance counselor is here, so why not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are all the teachers at this school like this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't you like it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like it? I love it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does she want to talk about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, the light's on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means someone must be here in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, staying here won't accomplish anything. I should go to the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is here in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio isn't here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she go to Triangle Mountain again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what's that over there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mio. I knew it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's she doing skipping her classes?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see the precious princess is skipping class again. Yuuki must be grieving his loss.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's got you so upset?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has nothing to do with you, Arima, all right? So leave me alone. It's no big deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those tears in your eyes say otherwise.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's unusual. She's normally so tough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line](Yes?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is someone there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, sorry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I mean, when you make that face, I know I'm in for it, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the heck is Boss Man? Whatever. Hey Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry, I've got to go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You're going to yell at me, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you think I'm angry? Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whoa, your face is twitching! It's terrifying![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]See! I knew I was in for it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just listen to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes.[%p]
