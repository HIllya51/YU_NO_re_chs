[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A place Mio would go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not downtown. I looked all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If anything happens, we should meet at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not in the downtown area?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost afternoon.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oops! Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait. Haven't I seen this woman on TV?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Excuse me. Hey, aren't you Koudai's son, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯that's right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What? You mean Dr. Arima?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. My best friend's son.[%p]
*push*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, well. So this is Dr. Arima's little son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not so little.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oops, sorry. I'm just so honest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That doesn't excuse anything.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, don't make that face. I know! How about we go to karaoke?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There's a lot I want to ask you about.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oopies! I still have some work I need to do.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, exactly.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your name was Takuya, right? Dr. Arima's son?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'd like to see him again if I can.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, excuse me. Send my regards to Ayumi. I'll be on my way now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah, sure thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haven't I seen this woman on TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why is she with Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm impressed that it's calmer during the day than at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived downtown, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I be going the opposite direction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This city's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what are you doing? Geez![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where the caf⑮ is, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school is in the opposite direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! She hasn't spoken in more than ten minutes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's walking along just fine on her own. Do I really need to walk her home?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see why she wouldn't be calm, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The timing was bad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez! When did I become such a suck-up to women?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I had something I wanted to discuss with Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wanted to talk about Triangle Mountain.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it wasn't the right time to bring it up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯ I just need a way to get things started.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey there, lady, what's got you in such a hurry?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you stop so suddenly? I nearly stuck my nose to the back of your head⋯ Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I forgot that book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Book?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The book I borrowed from the laboratory. I'll have trouble searching tonight without it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Trouble? Are you going somewhere?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not really. Anyway, I have to go get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This might be my chance.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, why are you standing front of me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go. It's faster that way.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you leave it at the laboratory?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? You're going to go get it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something wrong with that? Did you hide some embarrassing pictures in between the pages?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then it's decided. I run faster, so it'll be quicker.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But I don't know if you can get in. The school has an automatic lock that triggers at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯ Uh, I mean Ms. Ichijou should still be there with Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go. That's right, Mio just wait for me at that caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, over there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is it over there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes! Look, there's a huge sign right in front of you![%p]
[name]Mio[line]The Evening Caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes! You've been there before. You know it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's the only decent caf⑮ in the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you have been there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't stop by there after school all the time like you do, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be back as soon as I pick up that book.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You really shouldn't go to the caf⑮ after walking back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know what? Fine! Take a shit in the street for all I care![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you just tell me to shit in the street?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Shit in the street. You know. Spread your legs. Squat down. Take a dump.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not going to squat down and take a dump in the street![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you quit shouting? People are watching.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I'll be back.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There are so many books at the laboratory. Do you know which one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*sigh* It's a book titled 「Legacy.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Legacy」?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The title refers to heritage. Didn't you know that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not at all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shame on you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, I'll explain it to you later. I'll be waiting at the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't get caught by any strange men.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sure I'll be fine. There aren't that many Arimas in the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that's okay. Anyway. I just need to go to the school and get the book titled 「Legacy,」 right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, that was a good opportunity to talk to Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, time to go get that book! Let's hurry back to the school![%p]
