[name]Takuya[line]⋯Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's desert, all around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just Amanda, Kun-Kun, and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing but desert as far as the eye can see.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It'll take a few more days to get to the Imperial Capital on foot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll follow your orders, whatever they are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not breathing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must've suffered a lot⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's not breathing anymore⋯)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, it died for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯ I know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll leave it to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's staring at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like she's waiting for me to make a decision.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be impossible to walk from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Give me a break. We can't walk to the Imperial Capital from here with no food or water.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's still a few days' walk from here.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Just think it over. I'll go with whatever you choose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kun-Kun will never talk again.)[%p]
[name]Kun-Kun[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's already dead.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her body is getting cold.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Have you thought it over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯you can eat her, but I refuse.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]So you're going to starve yourself to death?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's suicide when you've given up your will to live, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, you're going to starve to death at this rate. You'll make all this Nogard's hard work meaningless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! I can't⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes, Takuya, you can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I know it's not fair to say this, but what are you going to do about your daughter, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]She could be alive somewhere. If you die, she'll⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say it![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No, I have to. Takuya, I can't let you try to escape reality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could you say that to me?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯ I've been fighting the God-Monarch and the Imperial Capital for a long time now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]One thing I learned from all my time was⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯that as long as I don't die, I won't lose.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You can't give up, not until the very end.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Even if you think it's all over, you have to keep moving. Until the very end.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Even when you've hit rock bottom with a bitter taste in your mouth, you won't lose unless you die. I tell myself that I can't lose.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]As long as I'm alive, I can make a comeback.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Look at me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm alive. I made it out of that mine. And I'm heading right back to face the God-Monarch, to throw down the gauntlet once again.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't give up, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sorry. I didn't mean to lecture you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know⋯some bastard gave me a similar speech a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Sounds like a smart man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh⋯ Just thinking about him makes me want to stay alive.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I know what you mean. Someone used to help me when I was a kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Her words supported me and made me who I am now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I've fallen to the depths of hell![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Even if that's true⋯ Our Goddess, Dela Grantia, will look upon you with a smile.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela Grantia? Isn't that the god that's supposed to descend upon the priestess?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes⋯ That's just a superstition though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to keep on living.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](For Kun-Kun, who brought us this far⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](For revenge on those who killed Celes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And for Yu-No, who's waiting for me somewhere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hm, looks like you calmed down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Your eyes were so red just a second ago, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it. Don't make me angry⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hahaha, I certainly don't want you to punch me again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was my bad. I wasn't in my right mind then.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's all right. We're alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We are, but⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's only because the Nogard sacrificed itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That's what you're thinking, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I know. All we can do now is live for that Nogard too, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. That's our only choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah⋯ That's all we can do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's all I can do.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Think about it long and hard before you make up your mind.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll wait.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll follow your orders, whatever they are.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It was you two that got us this far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know the answer⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just can't do it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My reasons are based on emotions, just like Amanda said.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](In the world I'm from, plenty of people would have chosen that option⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Some people even eat dogs and dolphins. Lots of people also complained about those cultures though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But even those people ate cows, pigs, and birds⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's basically the same thing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel close to this animal from spending so much time with her⋯ It's just my emotions, like Amanda said.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm just venting.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know that⋯ Or I should say, I knew that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know the answer. But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But at this rate, Amanda and I will die.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Will that make Kun-Kun's death pointless?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What did she go through all that suffering and bring us here for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda is right. If we die of starvation here, Kun-Kun's efforts will all have been for nothing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No one is going to come save us if we just hang around here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nothing is going to happen if we stay here. The only thing here is starvation and death.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯to do that to her⋯to Kun-Kun⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just can't do it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to get a handle on this situation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](First off, where am I?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if the Imperial Capital is close, I'm still smack dab in the middle of the desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Imperial Capital is still a few days' travel from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way someone can make it that far without any food. You'd die on the way there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the situation we've been thrown into.)[%p]
