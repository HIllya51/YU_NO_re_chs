[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antique-style light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty old-looking light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it really sets the atmosphere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll want to go to the bathroom if I keep looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bathroom's in the back on the left side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like going to the bathroom right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could increase entropy here, but the waitress would yell at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, it's incredibly unnatural for entropy to be small and ordered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meaning this caf⑮ is breaking the laws of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I'm the only one who would think this much about simple tables and chairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tables and chairs are evenly spaced around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entropy is extremely low.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, there is a tendency of things to move from order to disorder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light hanging down like some kind of plump eggplant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the caf⑮'s style of choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These curtains are rather unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rolling screens have become more popular recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are paintings on the walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone said that art isn't determined by the people, but by a bunch of brokers somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand that, I guess. I can't see what's so good about this painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some paintings on the walls, but I have no clue what they're depicting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an innocuous painting.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hey, do you want to bet, too?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hehehe, I'm feeling good today.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I made a bet with him. I bet that another accident would occur today or tomorrow, and he bet that one wouldn't.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Seems like another accident happened last night. That means I win.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]He's going to take me out to whatever restaurant I want.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Actually, I was just watching News Presence.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Something about that reporter Asakura is so refreshing.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I bet she can conquer any massive di⋯ Uh, I mean demon. Yeah, massive demon.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Which way will you bet? Will there be another lightning strike or not?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I made a bet with him about when the next lightning strike will occur.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You've heard of all the lightning strikes on the coastline, right?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I'm sure there will be another one.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What is this? Are you hitting on me?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Sorry to disappoint you, but that guy right there is my boyfriend.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What? A woman in tight clothes?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Why are men so interested in girls like that?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I like them too! Oh yeah, this is my first and last scene.[%p]
[name]Man[line]By the way, I stopped working at that construction site already.[%p]
[name]Man[line]This is just between you and me, but last night, there was an accident.[%p]
[name]Man[line]The company is trying to cover it up, but I was involved in it, ya see?[%p]
[name]Man[line]That construction director Toyotomi called us up all of a sudden to do transportation work at night.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey, hey, hey⋯ This is just between you and me.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Gotta watch out for that chief lady.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Right, News Presence. I saw it too.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I heard that the pretty chief, what's-her-name was shakin' in her boots.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I bet she doesn't give a damn about us workers.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Don't let that cute face fool ya.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What are you getting so annoyed for? I'm not talking about you.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Accidents have been happening there all the time.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Man[line]I wonder where I should work next.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Can't work at that construction site anymore. *flinch*[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, good. I thought it was that construction director, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Don't tell him I was saying that stuff, okay?[%p]
[name]Man[line]What? Have I been in this seat since last night?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Yes, I've been here the whole time⋯ Uh huh.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I just like this caf⑮, that's all. This is kinda like my reserved seat.[%p]
[name]Man[line]You can actually get tired sitting here for too long. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hmm, I haven't seen any woman in tight clothes.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What? Have I seen a super hot girl in black leather?[%p]
[name]Man[line]You must have a thing for stuff like that, huh?[%p]
[name]Man[line]By the way, I have a real thing for high school uniforms. Bonus points if it's a plaid mini skirt.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Umm. Did I say something weird?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Caf⑮s and greenery are completely inseparable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is pretty empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fancy, yet it's not that crowded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a jukebox.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like song number 1 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 2 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 3 is playing.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm gonna go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song really makes this place feel like a caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of when I talked to Ms. Eriko on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song has a somber mood to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song puts me on edge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me want to jump for joy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song brings back so many memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm moving outside when I listen to this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason I want to call for my big brother when I hear this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The poppy rhythms in this song sound so fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me feel like I need to stay up all night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of that one game.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listening to this song makes me realize there's some strange music in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, pressing that isn't going to do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Press the button.[%p]
