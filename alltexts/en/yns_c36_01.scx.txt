[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is that voice coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I heard it from beyond the door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an adjoining room. I didn't realize there was a second room when I was here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, I have a bad feeling⋯and my bad feelings are usually right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go check it out.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((I know⋯))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((If that's the case⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That Toyotomi's voice⋯and Ayumi's speaking too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what they're talking about⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They sound like they're talking about something, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I really am grateful to you, Toyotomi.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((I went to a lot of trouble to get those papers back.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Thank you⋯))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Without those, the board meeting that's about to start would be–))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, it would be very difficult for me.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((I will make sure there's no trouble for you.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Thank you. You've saved my life.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((But from what I saw, it appears there's a page missing.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Y-Yes, that's right.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((It seems the most important page is missing.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Are you hiding it somewhere, Chief?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Sorry⋯ That's confidential information.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((You won't tell me?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I can't say⋯ Not in my position.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((I see.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I'm sorry.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((You don't need to apologize. However, the scoundrel after that stone may show up again.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((That's true⋯))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Therefore, if I knew about the stone, the secret would be decentralized, making it easier to keep safe, right?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I still can't believe that happened. The stone was one of the company's most closely guarded secrets.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((There is nothing as loose as a person's lips⋯but let's put that aside.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((I'm sorry. There's no way I can tell you about the stone.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Chief.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Ah, Toyotomi!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That bastard!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop it⋯ What if someone hears us?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You should know how I feel, Chief.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ I do know how you feel, but⋯ Ah, wait⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I was heedless of the danger I put myself in to get those papers back for you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A-And I'm very grateful⋯ But, we're in the office⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why? No one's here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm serious, this isn't the place for this. Please understand⋯ Mmm.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]My condolences on the death of your husband.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If only I could fill the space that he left⋯ I always think about it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Y-You mean⋯that⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But I suppose I'm nothing compared to him⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Th-That's not true⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Chief⋯ What is that stone? Is it a Hypersense Stone?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]A little bird told me that's what your late husband was researching.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-Who told you that?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Just a little bird⋯ Come here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ooh![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're so beautiful⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi⋯please⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I want to be with you, Chief.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wait⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I want to know everything about you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What would you have done if I hadn't appeared when those yakuza attacked you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Can't you see? I will protect you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's right. We belong together.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Come closer⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You mean⋯like this?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, that's lovely Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯ Mmm⋯ Aah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why, Ayumi?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And with that⋯that bastard!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Damn⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]T-Toyotomi⋯ The phone is ringing.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I see⋯ It can't be helped.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The phone?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does she mean the one ringing in this room?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means that bastard Toyotomi is heading this way⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you doing here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi, Mr. Porn Director. Sorry to disturb you.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]How did you get in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Through the door, of course.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]How?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By opening the door and walking in.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone's been ringing for a while.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, someone will answer it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]So, you saw us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. So how does it feel to see your stepmother in such an immodest position?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't know what you came here for, but it's time for you to go home. Shall I call security?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go ahead. You'll only be causing trouble for yourself.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know what it means.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, bluffing is your specialty, I see. Let me guess, you'll 「call the police」 like last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you know about that?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Did you forget? I saved you from those yakuza.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that was after I out bluffed you.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So if you heard me say that, it means you were already watching when Ayumi was attacked by the yakuza.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like you planned to show up just in the nick of time.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't appreciate false accusations. Do you have any proof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I saw it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Saw what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I saw your secret meeting with those yakuza punks in the park at night.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's calmer than I expected.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does that mean? I've got a bad feeling about this⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]All right, let me ask you this. Got any proof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm a witness.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, cheeky. Even if you did see me meeting in the park with someone, how can you be sure they were the same yakuza that attacked the chief?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ I saw their faces, and heard their voices.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Their voices? From where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]F-From the bushes. Not even 10 yards away.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, so you can perfectly discern different voices from 10 yards away?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]And you have total confidence that you could identify people you saw in a park that wasn't completely lit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hahaha! Weak evidence like that would be torn apart in court. It means nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I saw you. I saw your secret meeting with those yakuza![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Then why don't you stop threatening me and call the cops? If you're right, then I'm a criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Do you know what happens when you slander a person without evidence? You should know there's a crime called 「defamation of character.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This bastard actually has a point.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was dark and they were far away.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't prove they're the same people⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But even though I don't have proof, I'm confident that Toyotomi and those yakuza had a secret meeting.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's the chief.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ Wh-What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It seems he broke in.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Is that true, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, I wanted to tell you something⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't trust this Toyotomi guy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you talking about, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night, I–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hold on, you can keep talking, but first listen to what I have to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Your words will cause trouble not only for you, but for her as well. Surely you can figure out that much, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Just a little joke, Chief. Nothing to worry about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're clearly not a child. It's time that you developed an adult's discretion. Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop! Please stop, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's the matter? You show up out of nowhere and lash out at Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this bastard–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi, last night, this asshole–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't make me hate you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We'll talk later tonight. All right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you, Ayumi? I thought you had an important meeting or something![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And instead you're with this son of a bitch⋯ Shit![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no⋯ Takuya, wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Couldn't she have listened to me a bit more?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Taking that guy's side⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What did I even come here for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now I look like an idiot⋯ Damn it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The voice came from over there⋯ Maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't hear the voice from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough of that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now, I should figure out where that voice came from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
