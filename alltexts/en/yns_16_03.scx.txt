[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was just a trick of the light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that someone's shadow?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mitsuki called from Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like she's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside the house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I should go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's good idea to call her from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear a lot of chatter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about that greenery gives me the creeps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. It's even creepier at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cursed, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not like someone's climbing up there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it just a trick of the light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's not the type to be climbing up and down walls like a spider.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way Mitsuki's as bad as Ms. Eriko was last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Mitsuki still in the mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a staircase that leads up to Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's strange. No one's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a road that will take you straight up to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of pine trees planted around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm certain I saw someone's shadow running into this mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no one here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the mansion where Ryuuzouji lives.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Mitsuki inside the mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a full moon tonight. What perfect timing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I imagined it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's even creepier around here at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that was Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would she do something like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looked like she was hiding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if she was, there's nothing I can do about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure the gate's shut tight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. The gate should be closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go inside. The gate is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I should take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The gate is closed. I can't go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's the case, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
