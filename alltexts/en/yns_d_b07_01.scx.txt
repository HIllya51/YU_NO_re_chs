[name]Takuya[line]This place is so damp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ My sense of direction keeps getting more and more warped.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm⋯ I think up ahead is a dead end.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah⋯*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is all wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where the water is flowing from.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]If it isn't seawater, it might be groundwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the humidity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see some jagged, bare rocks.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whoa, this water is super cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's groundwater⋯probably.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'm going to keep moving ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'm going to head back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
