[name]Takuya[line]It's the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯ Where are you, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's Mitsuki's voice.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, Takuya, where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I should go to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fieldstone. I can't break it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are rocks stacked up. They're called fieldstones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me, I've heard that karate masters can break stones with their hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard that roof tiles are easier to break, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Mitsuki anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is big, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this is all one-story, it'd almost be a crime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just how many people live in a house this big?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The is the building Mitsuki went into.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is what you'd call the main house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream. I don't need to swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream in the courtyard. This place is nuts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the headmaster makes a lot of money. Way more than my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't ride it anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will it break if I ride it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I think it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it, there's no way it would break if someone just my size got on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a stone bridge going across it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The arch shape can hold a lot of weight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The melody of the trees sound nice to my ears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Mephisto Waltz.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「La Campanella.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Transcendental ⑭tudes.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Minute Waltz.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「⑭tude Opus 10, Number 3.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Fantaisie-Impromptu.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Beethoven's Fifth.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Appassionata.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Farewell.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「My Original Song.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The leaves and branches are rustling together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty nice sound.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sunny again today. There hasn't been any rain lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she's not there. Mitsuki isn't an alien.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsukiiii![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking over there won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsukiiii![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She isn't hiding under any rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, there are so many pincher bugs and other little insects.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki really is late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just wait for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Standing around here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should search around the courtyard a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That building over there. What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like an old abandoned building is standing there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's purely Japanese. There are a lot of things here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only after Mitsuki comes back and I see that tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I came here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what did I even come here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki hasn't come back yet.[%p]
