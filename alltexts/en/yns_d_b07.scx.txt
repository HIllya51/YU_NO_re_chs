[name]Takuya[line]This place is so damp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ My sense of direction keeps getting more and more warped.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm⋯ I think up ahead is a dead end.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah⋯*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How long have I been walking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm certain I've gone really far by now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My sense of direction is completely off. I wonder where I am.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, this isn't the bottom of the ocean or anything, is it?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I should punch you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ My jokes are gradually stopping to be jokes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The damp air, a dark cave⋯and everything is so uncomfortably close.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be crazy if this didn't stress you out⋯)[%p]
