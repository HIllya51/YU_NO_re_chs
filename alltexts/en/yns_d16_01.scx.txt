[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to be here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ryuuzouji home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is Ryuuzouji's mansion⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ryuuzouji home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place has lot of trees, but it's amazingly well maintained.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it gets a lot of bugs in the summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stone is tiled. It is attached to a concrete wall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did they actually build this with stone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see. It's just stone veneer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I nervous about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That stone stairway looks like it would be exhausting to climb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this made out of stone? This is an incredible house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a road that will take you straight up to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope leading to the front gate of Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our school is located at the top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of pine trees planted around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm surprised to see trees planted here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow! It's been very carefully cut, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the mansion where Ryuuzouji lives.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the samurai mansion everyone gossips about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki said there's a rumor this place is cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Practically anything could exist in a mansion this big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a full moon tonight. What perfect timing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will look even better under the bright moonlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky perfectly complements the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is different, depending on the environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's even creepier around here at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing here in front of this huge mansion is overwhelming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really creepy around here at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, I was looking for Mio, wasn't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? He isn't home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just knocked on that heavy door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should come back later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe someone is home now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me! Is anyone here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nobody around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought that old lady was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she went shopping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I don't think I can go into Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe someone is home now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's right. This place doesn't have a doorbell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got no choice. I'll try the old fashioned way again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old woman who lives here is hard of hearing, so I guess I should just be patient and keep shouting.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I have ears, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaahh![%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Oh, you're that young man from the other day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The other day? I was just here⋯)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Are you waiting for my son?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, suuuree⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]He isn't home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's not back yet⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I'll come back.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Please do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. Even if I hang around a while, there's no guarantee I'll see him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll come back after a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I came to Ryuuzouji's house to see that tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anyone there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no doorbell. What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got no choice. I'll have to do this the old fashioned way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anyone here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's home.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Sorry, I'm hard of hearing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, it's okay. *thump thump*[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Well, who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ I'm a student at Sakaimachi Academy. I'm here to speak with Principal Ryuuzouji about something.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Oh, you know my son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Son?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this old lady is Ryuuzouji's mother.)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Sorry, he isn't home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if he's investigating something at the shrine.)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]I'm sure he'll be back soon. Unlike in the past, he is very scrupulous now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Come back in a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's nothing⋯ I'll come back another time.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Ryuuzouji's mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to see Ryuuzouji first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Didn't I come to Ryuuzouji's house to see that tapestry?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came all the way here. I should just go in.[%p]
