[name]Takuya[line](Wow, Ms. Eriko is in the school infirmary for once.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]All right. I think I understand what you're trying to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't this your job? Earn your keep.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's the plan. I wouldn't exactly call Ms. Hatano a regular in class, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I almost feel like I'm looking at a complete stranger.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not true. I'll get as close to you as you want, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey! You can't say stuff like that and jam your face in my cleavage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say that, but I can tell you're not really mad.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she dodging me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll let you ask her that. I'm busy working now. Do you understand what I mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you waving your hand like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Bye bye! Adieu! Hasta luego![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh come on! I didn't even have to help you with that stuff, but I did it anyway.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll thank you by treating you to ramen sometime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess I'll go then. Oh, didn't you want to talk to me about something?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah. Well, it was just a rumor. I heard a rumor about some kind of curse. But until recently, that's all it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard of it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Students have been asking me about it. Well, we can talk about it when we have time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Go on. Shoo![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, all right! Stop waving at me like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Come back if you need anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko disappeared into the back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I should go, too.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I knew Ms. Hatano had quite a few relationships, but how many people has she been with?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. But the rumors about her sleeping around aren't true.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sleeping around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone saw her leaving a hotel with a guy old enough to be her dad.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, I see. So that's why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with the vague response?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, well, I'd heard that before in a teachers' meeting. There was some concern over her bad influence on the other students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No one specifically mentioned Ms. Hatano's name. One of the teachers must have overheard the rumor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it was confirmed.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But it's odd. I wouldn't expect that of Ms. Hatano.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to Yuuki, the more outrageous it is, the juicier the gossip.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You've hit the nail on the head. It's like writing about the snow during winter. It's boring. But snow in summer? Now that's something people are interested in reading.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, did something happen with Ms. Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you have to go straight back to being serious?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you heard any of the rumors about her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Forget rumors. She just transferred to this school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And she has you as an advisor. Well, I didn't know either. I guess it was Kanna.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is there something going on there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you know. It might actually be serious. I got the information, but I haven't confirmed it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Let's hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On one condition.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm not giving you a pair of my panties if that's what you're going to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid. Don't tell anyone. Not Kanna, not anybody.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These administrators are always out of the loop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But is it really meddling if I tell Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not really any of her business.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it's Ms. Eriko. It should be fine.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes you don't know bullying is happening until you see it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If Kanna is having problems as a new transfer student, I should say something.)
[name]Eriko[line]All right. I understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not exaggerating when I say her human rights are on the line.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, you get intense when it involves a pretty damsel in distress.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That hurts. I'm intense about all girls.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you moved?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't be silly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But generally speaking, would you say she's involved with a lot of men?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that's right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Go get 'em, Ms. Hatano.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But from what I've seen, she conducts herself well and maintains good grades.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's practically an honor student.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Her social skills could use some work, but all-in-all, she rates high.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't schools usually appreciate more average students?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, teachers aren't perfect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say we should be unique, but sheep are easier to manage.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's exactly it. Deviants like you can bring the whole group down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're trying to crush all the individuality out of us with education?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's what education's all about. It's a way to reform individuals we find to be too individualistic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You see how it really is, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The other teachers get it, too. They just won't admit it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you'll do anything you want, won't you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm still getting used to being a teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hope she never gets used to it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya&Eriko[line]So, what were we talking about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was lucky.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You go first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um⋯ You're my advisor, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Though I'm loathe to admit it, yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I want to ask you something, as my advisor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You'd better not be contemplating something stupid![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! No! I just have a question![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're always so serious. It's a secret?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm talking about a girl, Kanna Hatano.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hatano⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course, I know her. I may not look it, but I'm her advisor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She visits the infirmary to rest a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's nothing really wrong with her. She just gets fevers sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She's the girl who transferred here a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I remember it very well, since you arrived at her welcome party half naked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would probably be better if you forgot about that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I believe she's taking remedial courses to improve her grades.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial courses?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Her grades aren't that bad. I'm sure she'll have no problem. I thought the remedial classes were today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. So what do you think of her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough* Wh-What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm not letting you dig your claws into her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm interested in her.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mm-hm! That's exactly what I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it's not like that! There are rumors about her and her relationships with men⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like an idiot trying to explain this.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Also, how are you even here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, I have feet?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought that was a good Yuuki-type joke.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm less tense now, for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's good.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now, how about the real reason?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Uhh⋯ Oh yeah, I have a headache.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Rejected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If it's a headache you can forget about, you'll be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Besides, there's no headache medicine here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We're fresh out. I put in a request at the office to get some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A school infirmary with no headache medicine is like a beef bowl with no beef.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What brought you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I said it was to come see you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That joke is as funny as your own face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch, that hurt.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm trying to find out why you're here when you should be attending your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that is a problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I've confirmed it's a problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But you just can't imagine trying to do something about it, can you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, about passing my class?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have that covered, so don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You have it covered?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I have to do is show up to class and they'll let me pass. It's no problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Considering you're here instead of attending class, I find your story a little hard to believe. Oh, but I just remembered, you have a surrogate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bingo. I'll just make it clear that he asked me about it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He wanted to be in that class so badly, and I thought I should help him out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph. It must be for Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you know?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the homeroom teacher after all. Well, I won't scold you about your remedial classes. It's also my responsibility to get you to graduate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That speeds things up.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The way this school teaches is by rote memorization. It's not completely meaningless, but I don't see the need to intentionally memorize everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, you've certainly got an opinion there.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So did you want something from me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something I wanted⋯ Right. Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sure seem to love people watching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is hidden by her hair, as usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, I want to be buried on those hills.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, what are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Curiosity is a good thing. Even school teachers say that![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]While we're on the subject, don't try sneaking your hand up to touch anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, no?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No means no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what about that magnificent fullness?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's bothering me, though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chest and those thighs. I don't know. It makes me a little excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not to mention that V-neck⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can feel your face pressed right between my breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a whole different kind of encounter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those clothes are pretty short.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you bending down in front of me like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You do look more official when you wear that coat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, I've never seen a doctor wear clothes as form-fitting as those.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even her bangs are long, so long I can hardly see her eyes. She tied the rest back and threw it over her shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong with your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets as always.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
