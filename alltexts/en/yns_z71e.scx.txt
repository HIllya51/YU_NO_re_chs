[name]Takuya[line]There's light coming from the prison.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]You! What are you⋯ Wait, this is a guest of the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you also looking for Ayumi⋯ I mean, the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Yes sir, I'm looking all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]That man locked up in the cell is gone now⋯isn't he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Could that scoundrel have done something to the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You might be right about that.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]But how did he escape his imprisonment?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's my fault⋯)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Farewell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyways, I need to look for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should walk to the sewer entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe I should go to the castle. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, how far do I have to go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
