[name]Takuya[line]There's a bag here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is weird. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I read this situation wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was pretty sure she would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Makes me curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio and I were secretly watching from this very spot yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's behavior is full of mysteries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. This is the place Kanna was investigating last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio seemed overly interested in it, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it means something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth could be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio was really looking into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth could be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't try to read the letters, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stone slab Mio was examining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not really a natural stone slab. It's as if someone cut a flat surface onto it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it the night before last?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a woman passed out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking about it now, I guess that happened two nights ago⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, this is also where I met that woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could something be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll open it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A towel and a change of clothes. There's a flashlight and a compass, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going on a trip somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A trip? No, it's more like an expedition or something of that sort⋯ An expedition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could this be Mio's?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why on earth is Mio's bag here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And where would she go, leaving her bag behind?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I shouldn't jump to conclusions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a fact that this is Mio's bag.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I know right now is that someone's bag is here, and what's inside it makes it look like they packed for some kind of trip.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I should leave this here for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone really might have just left it here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bag behind this rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something in the shadow of the rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's a bag of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The real question is, why is it here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rock looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if it isn't Mio's, it sure has me curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was Kanna doing here at the shrine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's there?! Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's dangerous to be here. Please leave right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dangerous? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The lightning striking along the coastline is dangerous. That's what I mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What on earth is she doing here, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please, I beg you. Arima, please leave this place now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You saw Mio, right? Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that bag over there, was that hers?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please leave this place immediately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Comes and goes like a passing breeze, that Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was she doing something over there again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Mio is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Reminds me of the time I was waiting for my old man to appear⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feels like it's a little cold, but maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check out that place first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check out that place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about it makes me curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think there are any more clues around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look into this more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to the coastline.[%p]
