[name]Mitsuki[line]Aren't we just going back and forth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entrance is right in front of us. We can get outside through there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should use 「Move」 on the edge of the screen if I want to go back in.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have no idea what you're talking about⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a wet incline, so we have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The boulders are wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we're not careful, we might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm glad I didn't wear stilettos today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think we can climb up if we grab the boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's light coming from outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface looks a little wet.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If we grab this, we should be able to climb easily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, let's go outside.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait, we're going back inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I want to go back a bit.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on. Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
