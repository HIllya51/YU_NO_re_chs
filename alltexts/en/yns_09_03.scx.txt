[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Want a smoke?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what kind of world is this when a teacher offers a cigarette to a student?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It may be against rules for a student to smoke, but the ramifications aren't specified, legally speaking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's forbidden by the school. And they certainly have punishments.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do they? It doesn't seem like you're a normal student though. I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because I look older.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hahaha. Your face and eyes have the look of a mischievous little boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a compliment or an insult?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's a compliment, by the way.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have to attend a mandatory staff meeting. It's just part of the job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously? I thought you'd be slacking off again. Oh, is that rude of me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, I like talking to you. Well, if classes are over, you better get on home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you haven't told me why you were at that mansion last night![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, she cheated me. I feel like she slipped right through my fingers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never thought Ms. Eriko would know about Mitsuki and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess homeroom teachers know a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm actually embarrassed about it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, but you know what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want to say I have no morals or something?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wouldn't say that. I do think you're crossing a line though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Considering the freedom of love, we don't need to listen to any criticisms of our relationship.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're right. However, you have no right to free love when you're a student and she's a teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what do you want now that you have Mitsuki and I in the palm of your hands?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm just a little interested in what Ichijou had to say. That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So if I don't tell you, you'll tell people about us.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wouldn't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what if I said⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯that I wouldn't talk?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's unfortunate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? It's just a regular lecture for remedial class.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, and I'd like to hear that lecture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you want to know about that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Didn't I tell you before that I just have an interest in that mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you think what Mitsuki talked about has anything to do with that mansion?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Am I mistaken?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, I'm the one asking questions.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph. Well, from the way you're reacting, I'll have to assume it's not far from the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an unfair assumption. You're trapping me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's the intuition of an adult at work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine. Yes, it's close to what you said.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I already told you. I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've also told you before that the girls are somewhat afraid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what, it's your responsibility as homeroom teacher? Get real.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You look like you don't trust me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, because I don't.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's concerns are serious, you know. I don't want them to be put down to simple curiosities.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I can't tell other people about her personal problems. You should ask Mitsuki about them yourself.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. I guess that's one way to figure it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Ms. Eriko trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why are you interested in what Mitsuki, I mean Ms. Ichijou, said? It was just a lecture for remedial class.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A lecture, huh⋯ By the way, you two were seeing each other, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, oh to be young. It's written all over your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. Older women are pretty perceptive. Is that the wisdom of age?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ugh! I might not look it, but I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ahem. Holding myself back here is what separates me from you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, don't give me that look. Anyway, I won't say anything about your relationship.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not even to the headmaster or other teachers?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Especially not to them. You and Ichijou would be in a lot of trouble if I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯phew.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]For the time being, I'm the only teacher who knows about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How much does she actually know?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]By the way, I have something I've been meaning to ask you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me too.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, who should start?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we rock, paper, scissors for it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay, go on shoot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, I was the one to break the ice, so how about a little consideration?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Have you no etiquette? Haven't you ever heard the phrase, ladies first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't seem very lady-like to me.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine⋯ After you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Thank you. So, about last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night? I was going to ask you about the same thing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right. But I'm talking about long before my time with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You met with Ichijou in the lab last night, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ How did you know that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've been on night shift around here recently. So I'm at the school during most nights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just happened to see us?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ichijou was tutoring me. She is teaching a remedial class, after all.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm. Let's be honest, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be honest⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm curious as to what she said to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting weird.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I just saw Kanna out in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Kanna⋯oh, Hatano? She comes here pretty often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is something wrong with her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She says she isn't feeling well. She's not making it up, like someone else I know around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that hurts. I've never made anything up about being sick.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, that's right. You're honest and tell me you're just sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks pretty annoyed at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that face she's making at me right now?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sure seem to love people watching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A cigarette in her mouth, letting her hair cover her face. She doesn't look like a school physician to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But for some reason she doesn't look sloppy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her tits are big⋯it gets me excited.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have some big tits.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I better be the only one you do this with.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. (Those are nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know, you shouldn't stare at a woman's breasts so obviously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say that, but I love how you're not even angry.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's because I know getting angry with you won't do any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What was that sound just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯probably the sound of my libido.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her skirt is really short, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm starting to get excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, is it really okay for a teacher to wear such revealing clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me happy, of course.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was your suggestion that there were endless benefits to wearing these kinds of clothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, you were correct in assuming that these clothes would get me through problems more smoothly when dealing with senior teachers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you weren't wearing these, you probably would have been mistaken for someone gnarly.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you mean, gnarly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll explain later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think Ms. Eriko isn't quite used to Japanese conventions.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can barely see her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her physician's coat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if she were playing with herself through her pockets?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You seem to be having some dirty thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet there's a ton of cigarettes in them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
