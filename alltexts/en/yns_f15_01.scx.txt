[name]Takuya[line]This is Kanna's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is quite⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, it's okay⋯ I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine? You can barely walk.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm really⋯
aah.
[name]Kanna[line]I'm really⋯aah.
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, Kanna! Are you okay?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you. I'm fine though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not convincing. At all. Your body is burning up.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This always happens, so I'll be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Do you always get fevers like this?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think a regular cold medicine is going to help this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah, back at my house⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, I know some really good medicine for this.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mother⋯well, you don't need to worry about it. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is I have some good fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go get it now. Just wait here.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be fine, I'll be back in a few minutes. Well, it might be longer than that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So just lie in bed.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll be back in a bit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where it is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the medicine box?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something that works for a high body temperature⋯ Hmmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her body aches, and her vision is failing, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does medicine for all that stuff even exist?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold medicine⋯isn't quite what I need. But there might be fever reducer in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this should reduce the fever, at least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯stomach medicine. That won't do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bandages, pain relief patches⋯there's no cold medicine though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I barely get one cold a year, so I don't know anything about medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold medicine, cold medicine⋯not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna looks like she's in pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems to be conscious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's sleeping.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks really hot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And she looks to be in pain, too. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is just like what happened in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really not the time to be looking at that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Kanna's apartment, apparently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I say apparently because I can hardly believe it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a simple apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does a girl really live here?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I probably shouldn't be absentmindedly staring around her place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to take care of her first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish there were some kind of fever reducer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯she didn't just move in here, did she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She transferred to our school over a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, it's strange. It's like she doesn't have a life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty usual for girls to have accessories, clothes, and other stuff everywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is nothing like Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this even a girl's room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's far beyond what I'd call simple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No videos or stereo system. There isn't even a TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck? There isn't even a phone in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't just leave her alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't leave Kanna alone.[%p]
