[name]Takuya[line]Come on, smile.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]L-Like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's got you so upset?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has nothing to do with you, Arima, all right? So leave me alone. It's no big deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those tears in your eyes say otherwise.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's unusual. She's normally so tough.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've got a bad feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, well. Maybe I should change the subject for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's talk about something else.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just said you canceled your remedial lesson, but you didn't tell the teacher, did you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I didn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's fine. With that kind of teacher, it's no problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That kind of teacher?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Weren't you happy to attend your remedial class, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about. Anyway, I didn't go to class.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You told me to go, but I decided against it. If you're not going, I'm not going.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But don't you think it's a bad idea to skip a class you volunteered for?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, come on! Why do you only argue at times like this? It's not fair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't trying to say I was right. Yuuki is taking my place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now you're making a face that tells me you just plain forgot.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I forgot about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll apologize to Yuuki later. I have to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not come?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Idiot![%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's still something I have to investigate. I only have so much time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you in such a rush? Triangle Mountain isn't going anywhere.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's running away from me. Relatively speaking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is running away from you⋯relatively?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You look like you're mulling it over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I was just distracted by the naked woman I pictured in my head. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem. I believe you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But the last time we talked, you were having a hard time not laughing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a month ago. A person can change a lot in a few days.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's exactly the kind of lame excuse I expected you to make.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does me believing you hurt you in some way?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not particularly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then, how far has your investigation come?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm right on the verge of discovering something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's hard to talk about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's hard to believe I went so quickly from laughing at her to being interested.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But if she found some kind of clue, I want to know what it is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Can't I do anything?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you're really doing your research. It's surprising to see someone so dedicated when they're working alone.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you see inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know shouldn't look without permission, but it doesn't hurt to take a peek, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, you're right. Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're just as crazy about ancient history as always.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who are you calling crazy? This is purely academic research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a pretty big claim you're making. When someone is as obsessed as you are about something, that's what you call it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, this is nothing compared to your father's research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's Triangle Mountain, as always.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. I feel like it's got something to do with the Sword Cape⋯ With Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it intuition?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not exactly scientific, but yeah, you could call it that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something to that too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. There's something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm starting to believe it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That was the place my father's letter was talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something there.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. And you didn't want to listen to me before, Arima.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll search the path I took one more time. See you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I use Mio's Notebook, I might discover something new.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm still wondering about that lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I try going to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you saying you have my notebook?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should have Mio's Notebook somewhere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should use it here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Unfortunately, I don't have Mio's Notebook.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, well.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If I don't have that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you don't have that, what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't repeat me. I'm being serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's written in that Notebook?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's my notes about the Sword Cape, information on the Twin Boulders⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You really are crazy about this stuff.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It may look that way to other people, but it's very important to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the notebook that's so important to Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Isn't that what I have here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I try using Mio's Notebook?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That thing might just be more valuable than my own life, and I lost it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]More valuable than your own life? You wouldn't be talking about your sea monkeys, would you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're the only one who thinks that's important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Don't you enjoy watching our little aquatic friends carry on their teeny lives? All creatures are our friends, you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sea monkeys![%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm talking about something important![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something important to me is the girl in front of me! Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Augh! Not that either![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Augh! It's like I'm getting dumber just talking to you. I'm talking about my notebook![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your notebook?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's Notebook?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so cute when she smiles.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to Mio for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, coiled like a snake.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not a coiled snake. I'm just annoyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm talking about how your hair's coiled up.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not very flattering. You should say my hair reminds you of a spiral seashell or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see the difference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about, weirdo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to say that whenever I see a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the chairs scattered around the laboratory. Maybe I'll have a seat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Groaning when you sit down makes you sound like an old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On second thought, I'll keep standing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not a pimple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what isn't a pimple?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm gonna kick you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But about that pimple⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your pimple is grossing me out.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're not making sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's really gross.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was just saying that you're very open-minded.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about? You're really weird, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, you've grown.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about all of the sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just noticing how much you've grown and changed mentally.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you eat some bad food or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you let me drag this ribbon across your skin?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you stupid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you rather eat the ribbon?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why don't you eat it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if I untie this⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you dare![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe if I take this ribbon off⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't even think about it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whenever I talk about uniforms, I end up talking like an idiot for some reason. I should stop.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you deliberately misunderstanding something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This skirt has a great look, but it'd be a lot better if it was about half an inch shorter.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Only you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I speak for all men when I say that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You speak for them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure, why not? I have the utmost respect for all of mankind.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Please stop talking to me, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](X-ray vision would be nice right about now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop being an idiot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm trying to sneak a peek under your skirt. Got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you looking at, Arima?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]White clouds.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not a radish.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course not![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't lick you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You'd better not lick me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, and Mio? You don't need to worry about me rubbing my cheek or licking the chair you sit on or anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're such a creep! Do that and I'll punch you right in the face![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're kinda scary sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a desk with some papers on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The desk is right in the middle of the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't carry this out of here, okay?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They're research papers on Triangle Mountain. You wouldn't be interested.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then why are they so messy?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't call me or my research messy. It's my personal research into Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Personal research?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bunch of messy paperwork. Are they diagrams of reproductive organs?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're the only one I know who would ask that, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a cute girl there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not so sure about her personality though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Still, she's pretty cute when she's quiet and smiles.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the laboratory.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the laboratory.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Mio doing here?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Aah! When did you get here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Geez, I can never let my guard down. And give that back![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh, this is my notebook?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You forgot it at the shrine. What would you have done if it was raining?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-Thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If I lost this, I don't know what I'd do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, you're making such a pretty face right now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never seen you like this, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Serene.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you saying that I'm not normally?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, let's not fight. Look, I found the thing you say is more important than your life.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know⋯ I'm grateful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could show it a little more.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Show it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With compensation.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean by compensation⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something as important as your life.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nah. Money can't buy what I want.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I hope you don't mean my body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's stupid.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing that I want⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-The thing you want⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to hear you laugh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Laugh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup. I want to see you laugh just once, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I knew it. You're making fun of me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I did find something incredibly valuable to you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't I?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-How am I supposed to laugh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just laugh, dummy. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]You could practically fit a watermelon in your mouth when you laugh, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, laugh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah hah⋯ Ah hah. Hah. How was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a little stiff, but it'll do.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now your face is fixed![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just as important as your life.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Here, is this good?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Good.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
