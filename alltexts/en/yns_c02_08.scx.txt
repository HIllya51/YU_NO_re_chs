[name]Takuya[line](What are you doing, Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She called out my old man's name.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ I'm going to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that a razor?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why does she have that up near her wrists?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No way!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to stop her!!!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop, Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be an idiot![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get that thing away from your wrist! You're killing me! I can't watch this![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ I can't live any longer. That's why I'm doing this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say things like that. What kind of person would choose to do this?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me, Ayumi. I'm choosing to do this now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯ This is crazy![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't! Don't come any closer. You'll just get blood all over you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai⋯ I'll be with you soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be an idiot! Stop![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No! Let go of me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you stop if I let go?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your mother is demanding that you let go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand how you feel, but there's no way I'm letting you do this. Think about what you're doing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're so young, how could you possibly understand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you, Ayumi? You're acting like a child yourself right now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]As your mother, I'm telling you to let go of me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You⋯ You hit me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You hit me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you may not understand right now, but I did it for your own good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Even my own parents never hit me like that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't exactly enjoy it, but I had to⋯ You're about to do something really stupid over something trivial.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What do you mean, 「trivial」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me what happened. Tell me what was so bad you thought you had to die for it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You won't understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not being fair.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I guess it is sort of trivial. I was doing so well. And I was happy, but then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm just a tired old woman now. No one wants anything to do with me anymore. I'm so stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say things like that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why? It's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so. Not at all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't patronize me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's true![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What do you even know about me, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I know your height⋯when you're standing up straight.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't be a dummy![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I just felt so lonely. I still do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. You don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I understand.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What could you know about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How am I supposed to answer that?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Just answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Say something![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Say something back to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I hit you, and you still won't say something?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why aren't you angry?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi. You should never do something so bad. It isn't right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! What do you think? Do I sound just like my old man?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh⋯ Anyway, now that you've hit me back, I suppose we're even, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you feeling a little calmer now?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's happening right now isn't as bad as you think, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I do know it's going to cause a lot of trouble for Toyotomi. I have photos as evidence. I'll prove his treachery one way or another.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That doesn't change the fact that those documents were stolen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The documents are, well⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry. You've got nothing to worry about. It's fine. All right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Is there something else?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How are you doing this, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How are you keeping track of all this? How did you get photographic evidence? How did you find the document? And why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯ That's kind of a long story.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean there's more to it? I'll listen to anything you want to tell me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's no way I can forgive–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I do something to upset you again?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, I can't forgive myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I just can't forgive myself. I couldn't trust my closest family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, don't worry about this. Okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How can you be like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How can you be so calm after I was so suspicious of you and treated you so poorly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's because⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're family.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Family⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do you love me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am asking you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I love you like family. I guess this is what loving your family is.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha! What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're awfully strange sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'm just not confident enough.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're not confident enough? For⋯love?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. For the type of love.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are different kinds of love, right? Family love, brotherly love⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Keep going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't say it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If you don't spit it out, I'm going to hit you again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now I'm in trouble.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're not in trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, come on, Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I asked you a question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I want to hear what you have to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I say anything, I'll regret it. We'll probably both regret it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, you'll never know if you don't say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I'll regret it for sure. I know I will.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe you won't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, no. I will. I'm positive.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Only now that I'm alone, I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know how you feel, Takuya. I think I always knew it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You knew?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I don't have to say it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, that's different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is it different?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Some things just have to be said out loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you really telling me to say it, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I'm ready. Somehow, I had a feeling this would happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got to be kidding.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saying something like that could cost you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't say that either. If I say it, I'll regret it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There are a lot of things you can't say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup. If I did, our relationship wouldn't be a parent and child anymore.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do you really want to have a parent and child relationship?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Forever?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not lying.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Then why don't you come here and give your mother a hug?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mother⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your eyes are red.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I cried a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're okay now, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, as long as you're holding me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Go ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know how you feel, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What? Don't misunderstand me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You never knew how I felt about you though, did you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Surprised?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, that's how I feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, you're really upset right now. I doubt this is how you really feel. Of course. That must be it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm upset and vulnerable. It's probably not real. But, I know me being alive right now is real.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can hear your heartbeat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's just⋯ It's just because all of this is happening, you know⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I tried to act the way a mother should around you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sometimes, I called myself your mother just as a reminder. And I did my best not to tempt you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But sometimes the way you looked at me or something you said made me sure you saw me as desirable. It made me feel good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is pounding.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]My heart is beating so fast, I can practically hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. I can't calm down.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Now I can say it. You've been so supportive, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Support me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Go ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to stop!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa! Tongue!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was⋯great.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's what a mature kiss is like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]First time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not! I have⋯some experience.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me too. A little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't lie.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, I'm inexperienced when it comes to being with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then⋯ Yeah. Me too, I guess.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Saving yourself for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come to my room. I just want your support. Now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
I can feel every bit of Ayumi's body against mine. She's not letting go.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right now, I want to know how much you love me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll only ever love you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the truth.[%p]
I kissed her the moment I said that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're so beautiful, Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To tell you the truth⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've always wanted to do this.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Takuya, you're so easy to read. I can see everything in your heart right there on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I guess I need to be more careful about that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. You don't have to be careful anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯[%p]
Ayumi started kissing me on my lips.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯[%p]
And I yanked her skirt off as quickly as I could. Somehow my heart started beating even faster.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm, you're being rough, aren't you?[%p]
Ayumi smiled at me in a way that clearly said she enjoyed it.[%p]
Then I continued tearing off the rest of her clothes. Ayumi gave herself to me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was amazing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks, Takuya. You were amazing too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's ever said that to me before.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ I can't imagine what those girls were thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're mine, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. I'm only yours, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I like you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
I've been waiting to hear those words for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't hear you. (Is it mean to make her say it again?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I like you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say it louder. One more time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I like you, Takuya! So much![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
The way Ayumi glanced down with that flush in her cheeks was so cute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ I like you, too. In fact, I love you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me too! Oh, I'm so happy to hear you say that! I love you, too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! I guess I shouldn't call you mom anymore.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! And I probably shouldn't call you son anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
For a moment, we just smiled at each other with nothing but love in our eyes.[%p]
I felt an intense rush of affection for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
Then I kissed Ayumi and tumbled down on top of her. I knew I must be heavy, but Ayumi just reached her hand around my back to hold me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ I love you so much.[%p]
I couldn't help but gently kiss both of her closed eyes.[%p]
The happy tears streaming from the corners of her eyes tasted so sweet on my tongue. And I could tell she enjoyed my touch. It was such a comfortable place to be.[%p]
In that moment, lying there with her, I embraced the feeling of joy.
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm having a bit of trouble breathing all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Peh!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My nose is plugged!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! Aaah! Aaaachoo![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Good morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ Good morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is pounding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. Ayumi and I were finally together last night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's kind of embarrassing to wake up next to her sneezing all over the place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she staring at her wrist?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something about Ayumi is off⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now she's staring at her own wrist, lost in thought.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something is definitely not right with her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if it's okay to ask her about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something feels strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wet hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She usually keeps her hair tied back, but she's left it down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's just staring at her wrist.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are you worrying about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is staring at her right wrist.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she thinking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't really seem like a good time to talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The faucet's running.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a water faucet⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's water flowing from it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't look like she's running a bath.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The faucet's on full blast.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she's running a bath?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't seem like she's taking a bath.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The bathtub will be full soon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There isn't much steam, so it must not be very hot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she's not taking a bath after all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is something wrong with Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels strange in the bathroom, like something's not right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That isn't it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't need an item right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't use that here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Ayumi's⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be using stuff.)[%p]
