[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki didn't sound normal on the phone⋯ I should go to the school gate![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I somehow managed to come back to my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I somehow managed to come back to my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was going to Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I somehow managed to come back to my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to be quiet so Ayumi doesn't catch me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll hurry into the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I got out without Ayumi noticing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where I need to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at my front door. The wind from the ocean is a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's gonna come home late again today. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry over to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi might be there![%p]
「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand, but that's what's written.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」 is what it says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some more writing⋯[%p]
「There are also other places where your 『Current Coordinates』 are noted, so please reference that as well.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sign. What does it say?[%p]
「This sign displays your current completion rate.」[%p]
「Your current junction discovery rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As much as humans destroy nature to put up man-made structures, they can't get away from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a strange connection we have with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants in my house, as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sexy fliers inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it would matter if there were. It'd just make me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, are there any fliers for video deliveries?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh! This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electricity bill. We have been using the AC lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the gate. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a gated entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tiled wall. It's not made of bricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall that surrounds the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why do Japanese people want to surround everything with walls?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The spaces are small enough as they are, but everyone puts up walls. Making it even smaller.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna clean it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room's window is on the left, the right one is my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They might start getting dirty if we don't clean them soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A normal antenna. The TV signal isn't bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We need a satellite dish to get satellite TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The antenna for the local channels. It's still the age of analog broadcasting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect 「upper middle class」 house imagined by us middle class people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house where Ayumi and I live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dark night sky. Like it'll swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't waste time staring into space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A clear blue sky with nice sunshine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, not a bad day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. There's not many people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. Probably because the ocean is relatively close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's totally the opposite direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I'm gonna wander around downtown in the middle of the day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, am I going downtown now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanna go home already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try going downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I go home, no one will be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll go back downtown since it's been a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the city in the distance. It's the only busy downtown area in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I don't think that's the right way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That place brings back memories, for a lot of reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not now. I have somewhere else to be, don't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, is this a good time to go to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not where I should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think there's somewhere I'm supposed to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going inside the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go in quietly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just tip-toe around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't I have somewhere else I should be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might bump into Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might bump into Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try going back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi went back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, I guess I'll go inside the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, we know where I have to go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, didn't I come outside so I could go to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was all ready to go to school and everything. Don't ruin it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, there was something weird about Mitsuki on the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to the school gate![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the school gate?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I can check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's faster to get to Ryuuzouji's mansion from the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. I kinda feel like I want to go to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, I'm heading to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I have anything to do there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's house is catty-corner from the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, I'm heading to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to Yuuki, Ayumi was at the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's go look for Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will ringing my own door bell accomplish?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going in the house, I should just walk in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit making me do such useless things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have other things to do.[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it again for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, quit it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's inside.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, who is it?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](O-Oh no. Ayumi's home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll just keep quiet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I got away with it for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I ringing this anyway? Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it for no reason.[%p]
