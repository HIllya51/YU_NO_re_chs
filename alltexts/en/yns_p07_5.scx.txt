[name]Takuya[line]Mio is rich girl that's always super unfriendly. She harasses me at every opportunity.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't want to hear anything about fulfilling obligations. All you did was sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're such an amateur. Sleeping is part of a hard day's work, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sleep is the only work you do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, what a bitch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a girl with beauty and brains be attending remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not here for me, are you? Muahaha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't be an idiot. Who would like a gross, ratty guy like you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that hurts.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It may be remedial classes, but I'm here of my own accord. I'm not here because my grades are bad like yours are, got it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I got it. *pant*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I feel dumb just talking to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I heard you've been walking home with Yuuki recently.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's none of your business.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]True.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]He's younger than me, but he's nice and considerate of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Glad to hear it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you look so disappointed?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you shoving your nose in something you shouldn't?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean, something I shouldn't?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already heard about it from Yuuki. All that curiosity is welling up inside you, huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? I was just asking him a few questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And let me tell you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you staring out the window? Look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you haven't lost your old lecturing habit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have no right to say that to me.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh, I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She passed right by like a gentle breeze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that was Kanna Hatano. So she's attending remedial classes, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, the transfer student Hatano? Didn't she just get here like a month ago?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's right. Kanna did just transfer in.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't think she'd be the kind of girl that needed to take summer remedial classes.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's that look in your eyes again, the same way you look at every girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You shouldn't go after Hatano.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What makes you say that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I hear a lot of unkind rumors about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. I get it, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that grin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's because Kanna is so cute. Heh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]S-So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're worried your position in class is in danger.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]In danger?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Prissy girls like you can't stand being anything less than number one in everything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]God. How ridiculous. I don't care about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, not even a little?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not even a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Zilch?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Zero.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No problem?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not in the least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's fine?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-It's fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hey! Quit unbuckling your belt![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said it was okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a joke. I guess it's true when they say Japanese people just don't get jokes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Y-Your jokes are just too dirty![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh ho⋯ Her face is beet red.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Pulling your pants down in front of someone isn't a joke, you know![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I think you're cuter.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What are you talking about all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does it make you happy when I say that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh? It looks like she's blushing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if she farted or something.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can tell what you're thinking by that stupid smirk on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then let's hear it. What was I thinking?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It was, you know⋯*mumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? I can't hear you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's⋯ Why are you making me say this?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Whatever. I'm going home![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she said though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me so curious.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]*sigh* There goes even more days off my life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, that dumb voice sounds familiar.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's me, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, days off your life?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Seeing you two fight makes me so tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd sure like to scuffle with her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uhm, you're not talking about scuffling in between the sheets, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not! Hahaha![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Anyway, Takuya⋯ Where did Miss Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, didn't you see?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*sigh* It looked like she got mad and went home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's exactly what she did.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She jumped right out the window when she saw you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh no⋯ I have to get going![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. He really went out using that emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Supposedly, you can get down to the front gate that way.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh yeah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I had something I wanted to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, you'll give me a heart attack appearing like that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ms. Ichijou was just looking for you downstairs in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Ichijou⋯ You mean Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. Don't say I didn't tell you. Now, I have to go after Miss Mio![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki was looking for me. I wonder what she wants?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The students practically got sucked outside as soon as the bell rang.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm willing to bet there's some huge vacuum out by the front gate.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's so dumb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Silent corridors inside the school are actually kinda creepy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not as dumb as your face though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio Shimazu. She's a student in the same class as me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks stuck up, and acts even more so. Hahaha!)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you laughing at, weirdo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a stuck up princess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is your hair all curly, little goody-two-shoes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, won't–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Won't you touch my dirty hair with that pretty hand of yours?」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think you got your adjectives mixed up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those curls really make me want to pull on her hair.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I won't go out through the window.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You can if you want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then maybe I will![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you doing crouched down like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, can't you tell? I'm trying to see the face of God.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*glare*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I-I'm kidding![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop. She looks like she's gonna kill me.)[%p]
