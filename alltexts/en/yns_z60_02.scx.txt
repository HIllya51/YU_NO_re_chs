[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same design as the temple I went in before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a beautiful, circular room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet inside the temple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious about that light in the center though⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's going to be fine. You don't need to worry so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems a little off to me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hehe, I'm fine. If anything happens, I'll protect you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not what I meant.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The pedestal in the center is glowing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that light be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The pedestal in the center is⋯glowing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that light be⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, we shouldn't go back now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's be very careful⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before, it was my carelessness that got Yu-No captured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make the same mistake.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You don't understand at all, do you? I said, be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh⋯well⋯as long as you understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's be very careful⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before, it was my carelessness that got Yu-No captured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make the same mistake.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]We should proceed with caution.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With caution, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You want to get closer to the pedestal, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are we gonna do⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see what that glowing thing is.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The Royal Guards will surround you in no time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll escape before they do.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hahaha! I like you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'll go check it out for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's okay, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Huh, it's so small.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There are beautiful gemstones set in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gemstones?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Right. It's round and glassy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Round⋯and glassy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beautiful gemstones are set in it?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Everything's just fine⋯ Hm?[%p]
*plop*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Ahhhhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda, are you all right?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm okay, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This is incredibly cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It nearly gave me frostbite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Frostbite?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah. Whew, that was close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Let's take our time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be careful.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's all right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯a reflector![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's a re-clef-tor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A reflector. It can transport you to another dimension.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hrmph. So, does it taste good?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a reflector here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wasn't expecting this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been over four years, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯is this a remnant from my world?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a reflector, for sure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is one of those doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just how are my world and Dela Grante connected?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this place⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Heeeeeeey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You haven't said a word since last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I've been thinking.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you spending all that time thinking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know. A lot of things.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You didn't even do anything for me last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You were only sweet to me the night before last, weren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm talking about⋯arriving at the Imperial Capital soon![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I see that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's that strange thing's fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What strange thing?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The thing you called a reflector.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What is that, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing may just hold the key to me getting back to where I'm actually supposed to be.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I don't really understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Neither do I.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Once we get to the Imperial Capital⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What are you going to do once we get there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to see the God-Monarch, whoever that is.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Are you stupid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you calling stupid?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Just stop it! Nothing will save your life if you try something like that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to, though.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda, why are you working for the resistance?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, out with it.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm trying to take back the power the God-Monarch stole from the people![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Trying to make a democracy, huh?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I don't know what democracy means, but I'm taking back the power to the people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Power to the people⋯ I would've wanted to give some of that power to Celes.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I remember⋯ The priestess of the Imperial Capital. She was your wife, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, pretty much.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The priestess is supposed to let God descend into her body for the happiness of the people⋯ Haha, what a riot, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]For the happiness of the people? Just look around. Everyone is miserable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any political expectations. All I know is hate for those bastards in the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]They say that hatred will kill you in the end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who says that?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will take your warning into consideration.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Please stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't. I can't stop now.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I promised Celes. The people who did that to her⋯ No, whoever gave the orders to them will get the same treatment she did.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same goes for those guys that took Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯ You look so scary right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're like a completely different person. Much different from when you were so nice to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry I couldn't live up to your expectations.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only way I know how to live.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I get it⋯ I can't really say anything against that. Not if you've made up your mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We should go our separate ways once we get to the capital.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Y-You don't like me anymore?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]W-Well⋯ You were only sweet to me that first day⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be quiet.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm saying this for the both of us. Amanda, you have a lot of things you need to do.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's gonna be okay. Let's split up once we get to the Capital.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't have much to do after I punch the God-Monarch in the face and get him to tell me where Yu-No is.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If there's anything I can do, I want to help. I'm serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All I can say is this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The God-Monarch is someone to be feared. He'll be anticipating everything you do and call you out on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's stopping the resistance, isn't he?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't take him lightly. You have to take your opportunity while you have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Let me say that one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You have to take your opportunity while you have it. If you don't, you'll be killed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All of my comrades fell victim to him. I'm practically the only one left in the resistance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're more alike that I thought.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Heh, maybe we are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're almost at the Capital. We'll split up from there.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All right⋯ But I'll be there if anything happens to you, Takuya. I promise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I don't know anything about the Imperial Capital yet.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You don't know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm from the countryside, so⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The Imperial Capital is a shadow of its former self.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A shadow?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you tell me more about it?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It'd be faster to see for yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There are less and less people living there each year. Pretty soon the population will dwindle to a two digit number.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Depopulation?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]No. People are simply disappearing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The pressure from the God-Monarch is bad, but the recent earthquake killed lots of people, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the earthquake⋯ So was that the God-Monarch's excuse and not the rage of mother nature?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That was⋯a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An earthquake just coincidentally took the lives of all those people?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then the terrible state the Imperial Capital in is⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Right. The earthquake caused a lot of the destruction. The Imperial Capital is in such terrible state⋯and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It seems to be the God-Monarch's very last stronghold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So the Imperial Capital is in bad shape, huh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the city Celes lived in.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Imperial Capital.)
[name]Amanda[line]The sacred lands around here are susceptible to invasions from outside the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This is the inside of the temple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the first time you've stepped foot inside, Amanda?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, this is sacred land.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is no one allowed to come here?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There are guards from the Imperial Capital protecting the area. It's probably pretty rare for people like us to come in through the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Last time you were here, you came straight from the Border, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see what you mean.[%p]
