[name]Takuya[line](Yuuki is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ew, stop it. That's my hairpin![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You can't take that. I love that hairpin so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who said I'd take it away?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh gosh. I thought you were going to ask for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Give it to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But are curses, legends, and monsters really just products of man's imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dude, you're talking about some pretty heavy stuff⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I mean, take one of those famous spooky ghost stories, for example. Do you really think they're a product of someone's imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think they really exist?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It would be pretty amazing if they do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you believe ghosts are real.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I think it's possible that ghosts and such come out into the world every once in a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which means there could be some portal to their world that opens once every hundred years or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off! What book did you get that from?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, couldn't you tell? It was this book by a doctor called Koudai or something. It's ridiculously interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why are you so upset all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, I also heard there's a vengeful spirit apparently counting plates in that old well near the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds like Ryuuzouji's mansion is haunted, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I mean⋯when did Headmaster Ryuuzouji move here?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wasn't it two months ago? He was already living there when rumors of that curse were spreading.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But it's strange, isn't it? What with all the lightning at the construction site and other weird things happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There might be some good things that come from those strange happenings though, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hehhehheh. Exactly. Miss Mio loves those kinds of stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Does she?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm actually collecting stories like that right now. Miss Mio will be so happy.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh no! Classes are starting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're taking remedial classes, too?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I have to answer roll call for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you sit in for me again?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I just really care about my senior.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is that okay with you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't give me that look. You just want to be in class with Mio, don't you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's right! You know me so well![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, you can attend class instead of me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heheheh. Thank you so much![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki's always a strange guy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stuff he was talking about was strange, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's not like this curse has anything to do with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a lot of other things I need to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Manschwing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't frown. You know that joke was a combination of mansion and schwing, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Explaining just makes it worse.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aw.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This dude really wears me out.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That mansion has a pretty dense patch of woods, doesn't it? That's why there's rumors about some kind of curse there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Having weird rumors spread because of how their house looks? I'm sure they don't appreciate that⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There's been rumors about everything from aliens to zombies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how those rumors get started.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, they started about a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But in the end, didn't it turn out to be a big cat running around at night?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]If you say that, then it's the end of the story. You should call it 「the beast who roams around the school, night after night.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You make it sound like some kind of movie.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It makes me sad that the rumors have all but disappeared, gone as quickly as they started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that again. Easy to excite, easy to cool down. That's just what Japanese people are like![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Some scholars say it was a very fast panther.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought they said it was a tiger?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There are plenty of theories, but they all come to the same conclusion. It disappeared one day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There haven't been any reported sightings lately, either. They were even covering it on TV for a while. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You seem disappointed.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I feel bad for the victims, but I gotta say, I am disappointed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ One person died, huh?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]They haven't found the head nor limbs yet. Guuuh, isn't that gross?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I saw that on TV once. I once heard a zoologist say that a panther could easily crush a human skull with its jaw.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*gag* Please stop, I'm starting to feel sick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, so the origin of that curse comes from that mansion.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was Ryuuzouji's house the whole time.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]By the way, you were just talking to the Headmaster, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, Mr. Ryuuzouji. Looks like he's having trouble remembering things.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say his house is nearby⋯ I don't know exactly where he lives, though.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What? Even though he's so well known?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the Headmaster that well known? Did he commit tax evasion or something?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, don't you remember the curse I mentioned yesterday?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the curse?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The origin of it comes from that mansion you can see behind me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see anything because you're in the way. Move over.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whoa, hey, watch it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So that mansion is the source of the curse.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, the samurai mansion with the woods? What about it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm trying to tell you, that's Mr. Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Do I?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't remember anything from the third year classes, but I'm glad I was able to sit next to Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rich girl?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. I was so surprised that your seat is right next to hers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. I thought remedial classes didn't have assigned seating.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, Miss Mio said that, too. It might be a coincidence, but I'm appalled you wouldn't jump at the opportunity before you![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hey, please don't look at me like that. It's scary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what? What's your point?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm just saying if you went to class, there could have been war right there on the spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look so happy.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, I did get to sit next to her for sixty minutes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you went and studied with Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, although I didn't understand the class at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're such a weirdo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A weirdo that calls himself my underling.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Call me Minion A. *whistle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's the sound of a secret agent working for a mysterious international entity trying to take over the world! *whistle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have your hands in your pockets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means you don't care much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have your hands in your pockets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you carrying something dangerous on you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No need to worry. I'm not holding anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody knows what those fingers are up to.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not doing anything.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's just a hoodie, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's your trademark. Always wearing the same hoodie.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I have a few different ones that are all the same design.[%p]
