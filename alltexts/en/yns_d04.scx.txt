[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A place Mio would go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not around downtown. I checked all the shops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right, sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's searching.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would help him relax.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If anything happens, we should meet at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I back at my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go left, it's the coastline, and the school gate is to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way I could be followed this far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was out all night⋯and I didn't tell Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi worried about me last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I stayed out⋯late?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I end up sleeping in Mio's Room?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no. C-Could we have slept in the same bed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But when I woke up, I was in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In Mio's bed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, when I was talking to Mio, her father knocked on the door and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I freaked out and hid in the bed. She was squishing me with her butt while I was under the covers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I fall asleep while that was happening?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I say to Mio if I see her today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Nothing happened last night.」 Is that what I should say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already noon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I was supposed to meet Mio in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was gonna show me a bunch of papers about Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lab, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go left, it's the coastline, and the school gate is to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya. Hehe, what happened with you and Miss Mio after that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After what? Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm. Has anything changed with Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same Mio as always. She's testy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She was talking to Mr. Ryuuzouji the other day and it seems she visited his house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio went to Ryuuzouji's house?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, she said she wanted to see a picture in his house or something like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A picture in Ryuuzouji's house?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like a tapestry?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh yes, there was a picture on this carpet-looking thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Are you going somewhere now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I have plans. Gonna study history.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, well. I have a half night shift today. So, I'll be in the laboratory for a while. Just not the whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what happened to Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, he was released without charges.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, must have had a good lawyer.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But he said he had an engagement and hurried off to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, I have to go back soon. Ms. Takeda said she wouldn't be back until almost midnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, you can come hang out if you want. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki has the night shift tonight, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city is straight down the road on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city is straight down the road on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door. Okay, I turn right at that corner to go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I turn right at that corner to go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not in my nature to just sit around the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet outside.[%p]
