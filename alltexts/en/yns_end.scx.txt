[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I read my old man's letter, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came here to meet someone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I came here to meet somebody.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The map said there was a Jewel here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a Jewel be in such a desolate place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Has it been here forever, or did someone leave it here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did someone have it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯who could have had it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Back here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where I met that blonde woman⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can feel something coming from the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. I can barely walk with all these trees around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I slip down these boulders, I'll fall right into the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anybody here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. It can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that⋯ There's someone on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh⋯ Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ I missed you. It's been so long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Nice to see you again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're finally together again.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Your hand is so warm, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's been a long time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A long time⋯?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Traveling through phenomena makes one instant seem as long as eternity itself⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I came in contact with the Grantia's consciousness.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I learned much from her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's below us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Its fate could not be changed. Dela Grante fell to this place 8,000 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even now, the Dela Grante that is in contact with this world still wanders between dimensions.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, it is a long, long vortex of phenomena⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]However, the chains of fate may one day be broken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I can only stay here for a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I've given myself to the flow of phenomena elements, so I'll have to leave here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]A place no one knows. A world no one has seen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think I'd let my own daughter go there alone?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hehe⋯ I'm glad I made it to your world to see you are still alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't go![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Thank you, Dad⋯ Please, you should leave me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It happened before. I took my eyes off of you for a moment, and you disappeared⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this time⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't let you go.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't let you go⋯not even to the end of the world.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But there's nothing there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll be there.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]May I⋯kiss you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll go anywhere with you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll always be with you⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]My son⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Heh⋯ What do you look so annoyed for?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]It's been a while.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]What? You think this is some kind of dream?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]It might be. It might not be.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I saw it, you know.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Everything you and your daughter accomplished.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Yu-No is such a good girl, isn't she?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I always wanted a granddaughter like her.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I can see everything that goes on in this world now⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Do you know why?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Because everything in this world is held within Vrinda's Tree.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]For me, the tree allows me to see all worlds, floating in the intervals between phenomena⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]My son⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I envy you.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]You will travel to the intervals between phenomena with Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]You'll go far back in time⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]You'll be able to observe true history.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]As a dreamer and a historian, it was the one thing I craved more than anything else. Tch.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Just what could be in the past, before so many phenomena?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]A truth that permeates many things?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Or a world of nothingness?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Could it be all the answers I've been searching for?[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]It's something no one has ever known⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]My son⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]What happened in Dela Grante⋯ What happened to Ayumi was so unfortunate.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]The thing that took over my friend Ryuuzouji was defeated, but⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Ayumi⋯kept on pursuing after me.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]And yet, Ayumi's misfortune is nothing more than the misfortune of that event.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Many Ayumis exist, and they are all the real Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]If it is what you want, you may be able to live on with Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Heh, if you have the chance, I think you should.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Ah yes, now you are with Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]My son⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]It looks like it's time.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Time for you to leave on your journey.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]Thank you for stopping by.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I'm glad I was able to speak with you one last time⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I will journey to the intervals between phenomena again.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]In order to find the truth, like a true historian, I must become an observer of Vrinda's Tree.[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I will become the eyes that watch this world⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]My son⋯[%p]
[name]Old Man[line]I dream of a day we may meet again, somewhere among the worlds⋯[%p]
