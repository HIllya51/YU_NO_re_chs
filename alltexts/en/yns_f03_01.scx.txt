[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though the decor seems like a younger woman's, it fits her perfectly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, looks like she's not home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though the decor seems like a younger woman's, it fits her perfectly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark enough that I can see stars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi looks at the stars every night while she lies in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The way the sunlight enters the room makes it nice and bright in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A skylight makes for a pretty good view into a woman's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should peek in from the roof next time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a very good curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtain for the skylight doesn't really work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the curtain that covers the bay window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cute curtains. Ayumi must like this kind of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a charming little stuffed animal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems Ayumi likes rabbits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even when it's a stuffed animal, I can't bring myself to like rabbits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those lifeless eyes, the twitchy movements, the endless chewing⋯ Bleh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi doesn't draw the curtain, even at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I do the same in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She probably doesn't worry about closing the curtains, since I'm the only one who'd look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know how to feel about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is cleverly hidden from the road.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So even if the curtains are left open, you don't have to worry about anyone seeing in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if anyone was gonna peek in, it'd be me. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These are imitation flowers. No need to water them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of little things like these flowers here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess it's not so bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a picture of Ayumi and the old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at it doesn't make me feel very good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Another picture of that bastard⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's making me angry. I'll just put it face down for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. It's stuck to the table. I can't move it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding. All right, I won't put it face down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, candles don't get as hot as people think. It can't burn me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there a candle here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be⋯? But⋯ Hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm an idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not old. I don't need to sit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm making sounds like that when I sit, I must be getting old.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why does my breath get shallow when I look at the bed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mm⋯*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That smells good. *pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's cushion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's another rabbit. I just have to hug this cute little bastard![%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now I'm the creep that goes into women's rooms and hugs their cushions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's such a thrilling sight. Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is cute though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This table's filled with knickknacks. Why do people buy these things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not really interested in things that don't have any real function.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I still wanna see it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*shiver* That's just creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The closet is filled with Ayumi's clothes, pajamas, and underwear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I open this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels nice and cool on my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a vent for the air conditioning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's off now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring up at the ceiling won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the main source of light for the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she uses fluorescent lights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can look, but I can't take it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light in front of the closet is where Ayumi gets ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I could put in a two-way mirror and stand on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'd see my legs though. And I could just barely hide my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be the mirror Ayumi changes in front of.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, I wish I had this mirror's view every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know who painted this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this a painting of? It looks like Ayumi likes portraits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The neck spins around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the bedside light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she reads before bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And inside the drawer⋯ No. I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not the kind of guy who snoops through a woman's dresser.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She uses this dresser as a side table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's decorated with a clock and landscape photos.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi loves cute things like flowers and rabbits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This vase has the only flowers in the room that aren't fake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This cordless phone makes it easy to talk and poop at the same time![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to hang up the phone right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I envy this chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet Ayumi sits here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, what must it be like to be this chair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't rifle through the trash in a woman's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's rude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if there were a bunch of balled-up tissues in there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might get excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in it. Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a make-up vanity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the vanity Ayumi uses to get dressed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never really seen her sit here to put on make-up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's really beautiful without all of that stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of flowers in Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a decoration⋯ This is an imitation, not the real thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess it's nice to look at.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff* *sniff sniff* This must be what Ayumi's pretty feet smell like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi walks on this rug every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, if I could just lie beneath her like this rug⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are knickknacks all over this room. You'd certainly never get bored.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how much I look around Ayumi's room, I never get bored.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go back to the living room.[%p]
