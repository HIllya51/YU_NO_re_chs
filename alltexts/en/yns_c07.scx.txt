[name]Takuya[line]The corridor. That woman named Kaori isn't here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's there at the corner of the corridor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The person closer to me is Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And opposite from him is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That newscaster, Kaori.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Saw her last night again today⋯ What is with that woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what they're talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So that means I can proceed?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Things have been postponed⋯ However, it should still be at that place.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]My my, aren't you being vague.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It can't be helped, given the circumstances.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm just doing my job, so I won't ask for your reasons⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that the obligation of the mass media? Hmm, how commendable.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. The people have a right to know.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Plus, your name becomes more well known.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's inevitable that people who are good at their job become more well known. I'm not doing this for my own benefit.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I know. I'll consider it carefully.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thank you kindly, Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't just call out to them like this.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So, just what are your plans?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's not something you need to know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But that makes me more interested. It's not realistic for you to talk about economics.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If it's not for profit, then perhaps it's simply academic curiosity?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's best you don't go after it. For the both of us.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* I'll keep that in mind. By the way⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What will you do about him?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ah. He was a very ambitious young man.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Mhmmm, but without his cooperation, we won't achieve what we're trying to do.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, that means we can't treat him very poorly.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But his methods are too aggressive. Using hoodlums is a big minus.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Not if it doesn't go public.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]He plans to slink back to his client with the secrets he learned.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. Well I'm sure he has his reasons.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, as long as I can fulfill my duty to the people, my lips will remain sealed.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Plus your reward.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Of course. I'm a professional, so I don't work for free.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]All right. We'll talk again if anything happens.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And one more thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It seems you've hired someone other than myself.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]And what is your concern with that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't want them getting in the way of my work.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There's nothing for you to worry about. I'm just having them follow Koudai's tracks.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A private detective?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing so serious. He's just a petty local investigator who specializes in backgrounds and affairs. You're in an altogether different class.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's my policy to not look down on any helping hand. He too can be useful.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Indeed⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh shit, they're coming this way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I better hide!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please don't see me, please don't see me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯why do I even need to hide in the first place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't done anything wrong! At least, not today⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I shouldn't have to sneak around like a criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, it wasn't exactly the situation to just pop out and say 「hello.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that lady⋯ I think her name's Kaori Asakura. That's the popular anchor on News Presence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell were they talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh!!![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hello.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heehee, peeking from the shadows? That wasn't a very racy scene though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, I'm caught.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That voice⋯ Do I hear an idiot?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Even if you're the Boss Man, that's so mean to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you need something from me?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, please listen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Woah man, what a woman![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯What.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on! Woah man. Wo-man⋯ I'm still working on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You mean, besides my extremely witty joke?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't look so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just tell me what you want.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Listen. I made an amazing discovery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An amazing discovery?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure you were just picking your nose and pulled out a huge booger.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How is that a discovery?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used to discover those all the time. I wondered how something that big could fit in my nose.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well that's you, Boss Man. Not me. My discovery was more grand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ So, what is it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, it's about Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yep. Lots of scholars have theories about that place, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I guess.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And what would you say if we made a new discovery?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh right, like you would.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aah! That hurts! Takuya, how come you're always so negative?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what did you discover?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There's some incredible treasure![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Just messing with you. Heh heh, I got that from Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Old things make girls hearts go a-flutter. Miss Mio is very smitten with ancient legends.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see, and what about you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, I have my doubts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as you're with Mio, you're fine. Right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, you get me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what did Mio discover?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, you see, we went to Triangle Mountain last night.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Yuuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That voice⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hey Miss Mio. I was just telling Boss Man about–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's enough talk. There's no need to tell Arima, is there?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, but you were just saying, 「If only I could talk to Arima about this.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Don't be stupid. I didn't say anything like that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? But you also said, 「Arima would know.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You misheard me Yuuki, that's all.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But weren't you talking to yourself about, 「If Arima would help me」 and stuff like that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]See, you did say that.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki, come here![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is up with those two?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They show up talking all this nonsense, and then they just leave.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do they think they're comedians? Well, I guess they're interesting enough to watch.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who are you calling a comedian?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't point at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The princess is the same as always.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came to the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor is dark. Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. Classes are already over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's the case, where should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway. I wonder if they're still holding remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm skipping class, so I should do my best not to get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came to the corridor, but⋯huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ryuuzouji and⋯ Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi. She's talking to Ryuuzouji about something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems a little serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've given my permission regarding the geological survey on school grounds, if the need arises.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you. I'm sorry⋯ I've been so much trouble to you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing to worry about. It's between friends, you and I.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ I'm very grateful.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]However, there is no way construction of that scale is a simple geological survey. What are you digging for?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, that's⋯um. It's a geological survey.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You don't have to hide anything from me. I've heard it before from Koudai Arima.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It seems your company is digging up some strange ore.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?! Koudai said that?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, was it something I wasn't supposed to hear?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No⋯ I'm sure he thought that it was okay to tell you, Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So, have you excavated the ore?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No⋯ We, um⋯ I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Can't tell me?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I apologize. I'm not trying to hide anything from you. You've helped me so much⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But it's a company secret. I know.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you for understanding.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's all right. So, is the research of that ore is being conducted at Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well⋯ That could be the case.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I hiding around the corner of this corridor?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I haven't done anything wrong! At least, not today⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just a weird situation to stumble upon.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So Ayumi, please come again if you need anything else.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Th-Thank you so much, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, Ayumi went up to the rooftop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji is⋯ Woah, here he comes!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm? Oh, it's you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ Hi.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If you're looking for Ayumi, she went up to the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji. No chinks in his armor, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said something about Ayumi heading for the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. They're probably in the middle of remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. Where's Ayumi?[%p]
