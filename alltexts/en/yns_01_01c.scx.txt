[name]Takuya[line]These papers⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「⋯so, this⋯very⋯and⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, it's no good. I can't read this part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll skip over this part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
「This R⋯but so called⋯ -im⋯ Machine has a very different quality.」[%p]
「⋯the time paradox would kill the person who invented the machine, making it an impractical proposition.」[%p]
「Even if we could return to the time we call the past, it isn't guaranteed that it would be the world that we know.」[%p]
「Professor Arima says this: As a historian, this theory is incredibly shocking. It calls into question the very meaning of world history.」[%p]
「If one loses sight of the world they should be in, there is no guarantee they can return to it. It is necessary for us to consider the meaning of the infinite⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The report ends here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure if I understood that or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji wanted the controller I have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Questioning him is one way to approach this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! There's a comprehensive list on the last page I didn't notice before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put it in the desk for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whenever you want to see it again, simply Look/Investigate the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is the R Device operation manual? It's essential.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
「The Reflector Device is a simple mechanism, but it is difficult to study.」[%p]
「I plan to revise my theories according to the functions I now understand more fully. This is still only a theory. I don't yet have the facts I need to prove it.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The section that describes how the device functions must be here somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll keep reading a little more.[%p]
「Reflector Device Operation⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of terms I don't understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just skim it.[%p]
「These phenomenal elements radiate from the Reflector along with the target phenomenon's individual phenomena spectrum.」[%p]
「The target phenomena return to the Reflector once the phenomenal element radiation waves resonate with the phenomenon spectrum.」[%p]
「Waves given off by the Reflector are interrupted by the radiation of the target fixation, forming the nodes and antinodes of the phenomenal element waves, Phenomenal Density Waves.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't understand that at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll keep reading.[%p]
「Once an unstable system is formed from this phenomenal density, you must orient the causality energy to the target phenomenon.」[%p]
「By creating this event shock, the system's instability makes a Phenomenon Leap Fold, linking our world to the target phenomenon, instantly transporting us from our world to there.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It allows an individual to move to different parallel worlds?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I had seen this a few days ago, I would have thought it was nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This part explains more about the device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't read it carefully, I won't understand.[%p]
「This Reflector device alters the energy of the ten stones embedded in it to bend time.」[%p]
「In each of the ten holes on the face, there is an energy pocket. When the stones embedded in them are touched, the inertia force withholding time's elasticity will be lost.」[%p]
「Time as we know it will stop flowing. While we cannot verify it with our eyes, it is certain that the stones exist in space-time.」[%p]
「Its position can be confirmed with the sensor on the bottom. By touching it, you can identify the position of the stone in stasis in relation to your own position.」[%p]
「But one must exercise the utmost caution with this device. That is⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this? The most important part is all worn out and I can't read it. Damn it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can't read it even after rubbing at it, then guess it's impossible to read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't make it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The timestamp is almost a year old.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is incredibly difficult to understand. I can't believe that old bastard read and understood this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try skimming through it.[%p]
「⋯myself, Dr. Ryuuzouji, and the newly added historian, Dr. Arima, combined our research to better define the hypothesis.」[%p]
「The concept of parallel worlds can be assumed to exist.」[%p]
「The theory proposed by Dr. Ryuuzouji, the Simple Parallel Type, is indeed simple, but it requires very specific reasoning.」[%p]
「A similar world exists simply in parallel, and we theorize that the Reflector device makes traveling to parallel worlds possible.」[%p]
「There are thought to be three systems. Think of each individual world as a room, and consider (1) an infinite number of fixed rooms⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It goes on and on about parallel worlds and world structures.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Parallel worlds, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll keep reading a little more⋯[%p]
*flip*[%p]
「⋯so both can be done.」[%p]
「This means there are no limits to worlds. They are propagated infinitely. The quantity of worlds increases endlessly. As a hypothesis, this does not sound realistic.」[%p]
「So a new assumption (3) arose⋯」[%p]
「This world model adds the possibility of conservation of mass to the infinite propagation model.」[%p]
「Moving makes a copy (proliferation) of the real world. So far, this resembles assumption (2).」[%p]
「But due to movement, the most tenuous world within parallel worlds–meaning a less realistic world–is eradicated.」[%p]
「The total energy is conserved, and a fixed quantity of parallel worlds is maintained⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So when parallel worlds are created, some are also destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is way out of my realm of understanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The paper is discolored.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It hasn't been that long. It's probably because this was printed on heat-sensitive paper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like this was typed up and printed in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Parallel worlds⋯principle⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯「Reflector Device Structure.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's even a diagram of this thing. I guess this is the user manual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The name says Yurika Imagawa.[%p]
Read the documents
Don't read the documents
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll read it carefully.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, reading this would just be a waste of time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put these papers away for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? There's something in the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there are jewels embedded in this controller.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Jewel 4][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Jewel 4][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]This doesn't seem like the right time to use that.[%p]
