[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a complete mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's unlocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that means I can go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this by myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be a different story if I had a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This storehouse is half destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not particularly strange. It's just a wreck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's much larger than usual, which means it takes a lot more work to maintain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's just as Ryuuzouji said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He lives alone with his mother, so I guess it's only natural things ended up this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls are really damaged.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one has done any maintenance on this storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a copse of trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the greenery around here is from the copse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is so clear, it makes me want to do a rain dance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And they say lightning is striking down at the coastline. How strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I hear something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet, but it sounds like someone's moaning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Moaning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this atmosphere, it's no wonder people talk about this place being cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like something could pop out at me any second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt Mitsuki is inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about it makes me curious. I should check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back.[%p]
