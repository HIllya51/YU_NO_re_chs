[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Do you despise me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For what?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]For being the way that I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't talk like that. There's no reason for you to disparage yourself.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Can you look at me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There is no one who would understand me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Do you know what that's like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know how you feel.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's a lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have no friends, no siblings, no parents, no family.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]A reality where I have no one I can talk to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A reality?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯ It was only yesterday for me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yesterday is the same as today, the day before yesterday is the same as one week ago⋯the same as one year ago⋯the same as ten years ago⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pitying myself, I spend days in my room remembering what Mother said. I survive, waiting for the same day to repeat tomorrow⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]When I see girls the same age as me all dressed up pretty, going out to enjoy themselves⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯I speak badly of myself while spending time just staying alive, and go back home to a dark room.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Are you saying you understand my life where I repeat that every single day?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Or are you saying there's some kind of meaning in staying alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I always asked myself one thing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is there any significance to my life as a human?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone has a reason to live.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That is sophistry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that's okay. Life has its significance.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Even when your dignity is being torn to bits everyday, is there still significance to life?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*thump thump*)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Can you still look at me now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Can you still look at how dirty I am?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You despise me, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You shouldn't joke about that. You have a great life.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just being alive is great. That's how everyone lives.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Even as a human with no dignity left?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not really sure, but I think being alive is a person's dignity in itself.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What can possibly be left in my disgusting existence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it! Don't disparage yourself like that![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not dirty.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please don't lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not lying.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Will you hold me then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Can you hold this body of mine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll have you know that it's not just sympathy or pride that makes me do it, either. I'm not as eccentric as that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Then, why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because I adore you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I adore you so much, I just want to hold you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the meaning of your existence, you ask? Look at how philosophical you are.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please don't make fun of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I'm so awkward, that's the only thing I can say right now.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima⋯ You're just like him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're talking about that old bastard, I won't take that as a compliment. I'm me. Not him.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
It's true that I did have special feelings for Kanna. But was it love that I felt for her?[%p]
A drop of water falls from her hair onto my body.[%p]
The rain has stopped all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
I hold her in my arms as we lay down on the wet grass.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima⋯you're very sweet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to be sweet to a sweet girl.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're sweeter than anyone I've ever met.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]*sigh* Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Relax.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, Takuya⋯[%p]
I took Kanna in my arms. Her body was so fragile, I felt like I could break her just by holding her.[%p]
When skin touched skin, I could feel the thumping in her chest.[%p]
We desired each other intensely. Why did I feel this much love for her?[%p]
「I have to protect this girl named Kanna.」 That feeling pierced my heart from deep within.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
We faced each other and kissed for a long time.[%p]
It was like we were being spurred on by some kind of time limit. It was intense, and felt everlasting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You have a strong chest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's ever said that to me before.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm not⋯comparing you to other people or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I know.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're very sweet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then, time for round two⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Dummy.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You were going to let go of something important for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something important?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What was left to you by Koudai Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯ That jewel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did you know about it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There was a girl⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That girl was loved dearly by her mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Having lost her father at a young age, that girl lived happily with her mother.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They couldn't stay in one place, for certain reasons⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It was because of a peculiarity that the girl and her mother shared.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]So the girl couldn't make any friends. Even if she made a friend, it didn't last long. She was always alone.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Her mother was like her big sister, and her best friend.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That girl hoped that this peace would continue on⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But no peace lasts forever. And then the inevitable happened⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I was 18 when my mother died.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The girl cried all through the night her mother passed.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]For three days and three nights, she wept.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Then she stopped crying⋯because some frightening adults came to her.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They said to the girl, 「We are sorry, but you have to go here. We're sure you'll be happy.」[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Before the girl knew it, the home she had was no longer hers.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]She wanted to live on her own, not in the facility recommended to her.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The adults all just wanted to use her⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But it was hard to obtain the things necessary in life.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you know that sleeping with someone satisfies more than the desire that every human has?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It creates connections of the flesh and buries the loneliness of the heart.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]And the body connects more easily than the heart.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The girl wanted to be connected to someone.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The body is different than the heart. It can make deep, deep connections so easily.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Even that moment of joy when connected⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's more than the joy that never existed.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]At first, she wept alone. The girl was ashamed of herself. She could not forgive herself and was miserable.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]She thought many times that she should join her mother⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But the girl's mother said this to her just before she died⋯[%p]
「We will face trial after trial while we are alive. You have to face them head-on.」[%p]
「Understand? You can't give up, not until the very end.」[%p]
「Even if you think it's all over, remember. Try your hardest, until the very end.」[%p]
「Remember this. Never give up, as long as you're alive. Remember that if you're alive, there's always the possibility that you can win.」[%p]
「Never ever give up or try to end your own life.」[%p]
「You can't give up. Believe in yourself.」[%p]
「You can't give up.」[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]And so that's how the girl lived for a long time.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]She lived every day just to not die.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Until the day they came to her.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]An open-hearted man with an easy smile and a quiet and gracious woman. They seemed like husband and wife.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They said they would take care of me. I wondered why.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The reason was that the woman had the same peculiarity as I did.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They gave me as much love as my mother did.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Their names were⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father⋯ He took you in⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That man is my other father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But he's not here anymore. He left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He left?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Stop that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wrong to do that to a girl who's unconscious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her lips look so soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! What am I trying to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* That's not how I should be behaving.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could lose myself in those eyes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's eyes are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her eyelids move sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she in pain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her eyes are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she passed out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Luckily, it's not that cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still warm this time of year. I don't think she'll catch a cold or anything.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm fine. I appreciate your concern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wet from the rain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rain made it wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her cheeks are flushed red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because of the fever?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I feel⋯a little better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her cheeks are flushed. They're all red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks cute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I thinking at a time like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bruise looks painful.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Getting wet in the rain made me feel a little better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got this jewel from my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can use it to find that bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The girl that my father sent money to, Kanna Hatano.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She transferred schools ten times, but never got far from Triangle Mountain.
[name]Takuya[line]The girl in the picture that's more than fifty years old.
[name]Takuya[line]She's always cool and calm.
[name]Takuya[line]A girl like an angel who plays with a puppy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the girl who was with Houjou and those other men.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which one is the real her?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They're both me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa⋯were you awake the whole time?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can tell how you feel without asking.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you cold? You can borrow my jacket. It's a little sweaty, though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want I can give you a piggyback and–[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I just went to the fountain to get your necklace, but⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The blue gemstone wasn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, yeah. Only the stone was missing. Someone must have taken it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. It dissolved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm sorry, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you apologizing?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's my fault you're going through all this trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean Houjou? That bastard will get what he deserves. There's absolutely nothing for you to worry about, Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, it's my fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]About⋯your father, and about myself⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Houjou wants to know where my old man is, and also take this jewel that I have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be precise, it's not what Houjou wants, but it's what his 「employer」 wants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me, Ms. Eriko said she was interested in Houjou's employer, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Kanna[line]((Arima, you shouldn't be here!))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((This person⋯ No, the person behind this person is trying to–))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it that you know, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Houjou said something weird when he hit Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He knew that I had the jewel and that it was a keepsake from my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be precise, I should say that Houjou's employer knew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did they know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About me⋯ No, about the jewel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just who is Houjou's employer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bruise looks painful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's where Houjou hit her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of asshole would hit a girl?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should have made him pay more than I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll try talking a little more⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't move her, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's leaning in the shade of the tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I should move her now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wet from the rain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's wet from the rain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could Kanna be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that where I should be looking? Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tree in the woods⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It should keep the rain off a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're under a tree, so this should keep some of the rain off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is wet from the rain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're inside the woods in the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wet from the rain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should take care of Kanna.[%p]
