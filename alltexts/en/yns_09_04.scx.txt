[name]Takuya[line](She looks terrible. Look at all that sweat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko's first aid is pretty good though. Well, she is the school physician after all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's calmed down a bit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like she's shivering for some reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she hurting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's lips.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look so soft.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki Have you come to?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What⋯happened to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You had a car accident.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]An accident?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯is that you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. Don't worry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm scared⋯ I'm so scared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing to be afraid of. Ms. Eriko is here, too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eriko?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Takeda, the school physician.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That woman?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Owww⋯ Don't grab me like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, that woman is dangerous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dangerous? It's Ms. Eriko. The school physician.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, she's very dangerous! No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she so frightened?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is dangerous?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are a lot of mysterious things about her, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯she was the one that saved Mitsuki and treated her.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I saw it⋯in the back of the warehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the back of the warehouse?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's⋯ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Behind the door⋯but you have to find another way in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Another way in?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's a lock welded to that iron door. You can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So how do you get in?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's⋯ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]My head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]My head is killing me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Try to lie down for a while. You hit your head in the accident.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good, just like that. It's okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's so bright in here. Turn off the light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light? Oh, sorry, I didn't notice.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thank you Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you thanking me for?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Where is Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She went to the pharmacy to get more headache medicine. She should be back soon.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! Was that thunder?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The weather was so calm just a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess the weather is volatile this time of the year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just hope another lightning bolt doesn't strike the coast like last time.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's⋯going to rain, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you need an umbrella, there's plenty extra. It'll be okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thank you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you've calmed down.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is it okay that you're out this late at night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Aren't your parents worried about you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you talking about all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You should at least call them. They'll be worried about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure⋯ I will.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even now, Mitsuki is such a worry wort.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Must be a teacher's habit. Hahaha⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But even if I wanted to call home, where is there a phone?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If you need a phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If you need a phone, there should be one on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to make Ayumi worry. She's right about that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The next desk⋯ That's Ms. Eriko's work desk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. I should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a must, so don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm, the phone, where's the phone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I found a phony phone? Haha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a Yuuki-joke if I ever heard one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I made my way to the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What side was it on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, here it is. It was on the right side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of those that you can make a call using the speaker phone. Okay, here's the button to dial out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see, to dial outside the school I need to press 1 first.[%p]
*ring⋯ring*[%p]
*ring⋯ring*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's picking up. Maybe Ayumi isn't home from work yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I'll call again later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]More thunder. I wonder if a storm is rolling in.
[name]Takuya[line]Huh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Behind me?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Time to die, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What⋯what's happening?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't have much time to think!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She called me on the phone to meet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯yet no one was in the mansion when I arrived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, one person was there. The old lady⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it suicide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then there's Ryuuzouji's journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I was in such a rush that I forgot to bring it with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was some weird stuff written in that journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He used the word 「she」 quite often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who he was referring to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And at the very end of it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯there were bits about dying and his body hurting. I wonder what he was trying to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* There's too much to think about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, it looks like Mitsuki calmed down a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her injuries seem pretty light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's sweating, but it looks like she's not in as much pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looked like she was in agony a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems relatively calm now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those bandages look painful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm so glad she only suffered minor injuries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko took care of her so fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though she acts weird, I guess when the time comes, she gets the job done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fluffy, and looks soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's breasts⋯ I shouldn't stare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They have a way of drawing my eyes to them though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because Mitsuki is attractive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the hell am I trying to make excuses to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no. I shouldn't be looking there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki's suit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A nice, sharp business suit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shows her personality well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A pillow. I wish I could be her pillow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯is she okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks to be in pain still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki still looks like she's in pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do for her though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a pretty comfy bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is relatively calm. I'm glad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the highest quality bed, but it's comfortable enough to sleep on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know it's true coming from me. I've taken so many naps on this bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That has nothing to do with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It isn't something Mitsuki needs at the moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I supposed to do with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This doesn't seem like the right time to use that.[%p]
