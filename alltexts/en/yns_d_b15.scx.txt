[name]Takuya[line]It's a dim, small room, surrounded on all sides by rock walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's literally nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]None of the items I have with me will break that door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯ This path just keeps going on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This would go a lot faster if I really did have a rocket launcher⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course I don't have anything like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be something I can use to break down that door.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But is there anything around here that could help⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There has to be something up ahead.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's what that door is here for, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's an entrance! All right!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could be inside?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just go in!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a small, empty room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should check it out.[%p]
