[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is laying over to the side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should search this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flame is flickering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it's flickering, that means there's⋯wind?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means there's an exit from this room somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anything that looks like an exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way for me to get back, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! What am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no other exit in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this another dead end?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it automatically ignited when I stumbled in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A device that automatically ignites⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's not that difficult of a concept. Anyone who likes handicrafts could probably set it up in no time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if the thing I stepped on before was a switch⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this person died leaning up against the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof, he must've been bone-tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get it? Because it's a skeleton⋯leaning against the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I explaining it? Fine, let's try taking this seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This person died standing up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They probably suffered a pretty tragic death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem isn't this skeleton though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how you look at it, it definitely is a skeleton.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the problem is⋯what is it doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this skeleton is here, that means someone died here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just glad to see it's been a long time since someone died here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it were a half decomposed body⋯ Guh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how long it's been since they died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However they got here, I bet the first thing they did was sit down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This skeleton is sitting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't matter that it's sitting down⋯ What matters is, how did they die?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how you look at it, this is definitely a skeleton.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is, what is it doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this skeleton is here, that means someone died here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just glad to see it's been a long time since someone died here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it were a half decomposed body⋯ Guh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how long it's been since they died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There're spears sticking through both of them⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell happened here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they were killed by spears, does that mean there was some kind of battle here⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The spears are the problem⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think they probably died from the spear wounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This one went right through him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I look, nothing is going to appear on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are just some pebbles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A shelf made of stone, perhaps?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet something used to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now all that's left are some pebbles⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a coffin made of stone with some kind of pattern on the lid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio mentioned something about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was researching something from around 400 years ago⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this was the secret of Triangle Mountain she was looking for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ruins from around 1,600 years ago⋯ Right around the time the Yamato dynasty was established. This is a huge discovery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to imagine it's something else, but this really looks like a sarcophagus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sarcophagus is a rectangular coffin made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I read in a book once that they were even widely used in ancient Japan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So could this place be some kind of ancient ruin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a rectangular container made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This really looks like⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This doesn't seem to matter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Boxes or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some of them are broken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Under the floor is⋯ Yup, I knew it. More stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are stones laid out over a stone floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obviously, the floor's made of stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's broken in places. I should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This spear is driven into the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's driven into the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell happened here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The outlines of the tiles are like a lattice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something like a button here.[%p]
Should I press it?
Press the button
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coffin lid⋯is opening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've already had a bad experience randomly pressing buttons⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be really careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the lid to the sarcophagus⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something carved into it. I wonder what it could be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An angel⋯and a devil. They're both carved into the sarcophagus lid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has good and evil on it. It's the same concept as that other thing I saw on my way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The tiles are split into a lattice structure. There's a button here too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Should I press it?
Press the button
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coffin lid⋯is opening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've already had a bad experience randomly pressing buttons⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be really careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Skeletons in a dimly lit room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like something you'd see in a nightmare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flame is lit, but that doesn't make it any brighter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be complaining⋯seeing how I don't have a flashlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Mitsuki. If you're gonna move, you should've told me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Mitsuki is still peacefully sitting where I put her down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah!
[name]Takuya[line]Aaaahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What the hell!?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-This⋯ Calm down, just calm down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a skeleton! It's a dried up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mummy![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mummy. What do I do?[%p]
Research the mummy
Don't research it
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I should check this thing out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I don't need to check the mummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something I have to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki passed out⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
