[name]Takuya[line]We reached the dry well, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can barely see anything inside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone mentioned there being a ripped piece of a journal around here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The inside is pitch-black. If it was daytime, we could've taken a good look at everything⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so dark I can't see a single thing inside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks pretty deep⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like someone piled up some rocks to make a well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wells are really old fashioned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks old too. Seems like it's been years since someone used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of rocks piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made like a pretty traditional well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks really heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a pretty heavy stone disc.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it was used as the cap to the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say it looks barren, but it actually looks more overgrown than anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's lots of vegetation growing around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to the storehouse entrance first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Ms. Eriko looking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back to the storehouse entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see anything⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dangerous, so I shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
