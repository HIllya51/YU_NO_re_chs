[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, Ayumi's office is on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see her and talk to her so I can resolve this misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to push it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I push it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, it opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get in now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I have something to do before this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I do it in the wrong order?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open, so there's no need for me to fidget with this thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used the card. Now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm trying to tell you to insert that in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this without a card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to use a Jewel or use 「Keep Map and Items as is」 and get a card somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a very thin opening, like a slit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like before, there's a small, blue light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I put that in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I actually don't have a card to insert here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the [Magnetic Card]. This is what I need now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go find it somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I push it, nothing changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I tried using the card, but it didn't work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks the same as the device in front.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small red light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this without a card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to use a Jewel or use 「Keep Map and Items as is」 and get a card somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small slit there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks just like the device on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this one has a red light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at this is making my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect brightness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm all alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The red light hurts my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bright red light against the gray wall makes it stand out even more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This really feels like an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is closed, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the door is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First off, the door is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wouldn't it be bad to just go inside somewhere else?[%p]
