[name]Yuuki[line]It looks like we keep going back and forth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entrance is right in front of us. We can get outside through there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should use 「Move」 on the edge of the screen if I want to go back in.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't really know what you're talking about⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a wet incline, so we have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The boulders are wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we're not careful, we might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oopsie, I slipped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think we can climb up if we grab the boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's light coming from outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface looks a little wet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It doesn't look that difficult to climb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are we going back inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. We're going back.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]All right. Let's go then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
