[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if she was examining the rocks.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would she need to examine the rocks though?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What does it matter what I'm examining?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, so you're still here, doing that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pursuing your ancient history fantasies is all good, but don't you think it might affect your grades?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll have you know that I'm in the top five in every one of my classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about gym class?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Gym, including health studies, is sitting high at an A right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit. Well then, if you're doing something so boring, guys will never be attracted to you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she being quiet now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So these are the Twin Boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's crouched down in front of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's commonly known as the Twin Boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They call it that because the two rocks are facing each other.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not quite right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, no. Look at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Where?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Where? It's obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I dunno about going to a hotel at this time of day.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Idiot! We're going to school; remedial classes are about to start.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Re-me-di-al cla-sses? Why would you go to those?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]B-Because⋯ You have to attend remedial classes, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I do. But⋯why would a goody-two-shoes like you attend?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well⋯reviewing helps me keep good grades.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never mind! You better go attend class. Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's pretty cute, if only she could just smile and keep her mouth shut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she examining the rocks for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Mio's notebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said the only thing more important to her than this is her own life. What if it got rained on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There seems to be something written down⋯ But the writing is smudged and hard to read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, maybe because it's dirty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, I can read even less now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ I should give this back to Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, but there are some words that are legible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, let's see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「As stated above, some type of clue seems to exist on the slab of the Twin Boulders.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot about Triangle Mountain, aka Sword Cape written here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be pretty impressive if she found out all this by herself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Mio's Notebook][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Mio's Notebook][color index="800000"].
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. Girls should be graceful and cute, huh? You sound just like my dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your dad?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mind you, he's my biological father, not a sugar daddy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't even say anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I already know what you're going to say before you say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then, try to guess what I'm about to say right now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, Mio, you're a goddess of light, of love. Even Aphrodite herself fades in the shadows of your glory. Is that it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got some guts.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll have you know that my obsession with ancient history isn't some fad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]History is an account of all the rises and falls of human society.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I find happiness by untangling the knots created by history.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound just like my old man.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think your father was an incredible scholar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop joking around. If he was incredible, then that makes me a god.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You don't understand your father, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, s-sorry⋯ I know the accident was recent. It was careless of me to say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it. I'm more curious about why you're so interested in my old man.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, have you ever seriously listened to one of his lectures, or even read his books?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man's books and lectures?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whenever my old man talked to me, it went in one ear and out the other.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This has nothing to do with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing in a place like this?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has nothing to do with you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes it does.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, it does not have nothing to do with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You might want to check your grammar.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're the one who said it. Just stay out of my way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to know what she's doing.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm on a walk.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. You followed me here, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not some kind of detective. It's just a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh really. Are you sure you didn't come to get in my way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get in the way of what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is wrong with her?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The only thing more important to me than this is my own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Second only to her own life, eh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You just gave it back to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, not that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This is what I've been writing all my research notes in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, let's see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「As stated above, some type of clue seems to exist on the slab of the Twin Boulders.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, no![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you panicking?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, I actually already read everything written inside.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. Unfortunately for you, it was all research notes on Sword Cape, wasn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha, I bet there's some kind of embarrassing confession in there somewhere.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No way! It's all the data I found regarding Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean Triangle Mountain? People who call themselves historians already came to investigate it. What's the point now?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has nothing to do with you, Arima. I'll have you know that the only thing more important to me than this is my own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, whatever.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It does have my curiosity though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She could smile a bit more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's frowning, as usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's pretty cute when she's just smiling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I couldn't say that to her even if I tried.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I see it, I can't get over how curly her hair is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said curly, not hurly-burly![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking to yourself about, weirdo? Stay out of my way, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki called them 「roly poly dumplings」 before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, now's my chance to show off my excellent punnage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really curly like a–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Stop, you're embarrassing me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, you're so surly.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, did you get some kind of weird idea?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so curly, so I'm going to call you Little Miss Shirley.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, my cute Little Miss Shirley.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't say things like that, you embarrass me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so embarrassing about that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-It's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's alive![%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm done dealing with idiots like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I give no consent to any weirdo stuff you're about to do. Just go over there and stay out of my way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't done anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sakaimachi Academy's uniform has a cute ribbon on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't know what'll happen if you pull the ribbon off unless you try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ready.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean, 「ready」? You won't get away with any funny business![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I look at Mio's chest, she'll turn into a great demon, so I should probably stop.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about? Stay out of my way.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you have anything else to look at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]F-For a second there, Mio looked like a great demon god.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be around 32B, yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, cup size is determined by the difference between the under-bust and top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can explain how to measure both some other time.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you saying? Weirdo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop it. I don't want to face hell yet.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If you keep looking there, the next thing you'll be seeing is hell.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just the clear, blue sky.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Want to get a peek of hell too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're pretty extreme lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A uniform. The skirt is nice and short.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uniforms do exist at Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's not mandatory that we wear them to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio probably wears hers because she's obsessed with school uniforms.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't narrate our lives like some creep.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Please stay out of my way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What on earth has she been doing?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you really come here to do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's really sick of me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey! I give no consent to any weirdo stuff you're about to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does touching your thigh count as weirdo stuff?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That should be obvious![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mind if you want to touch me. Look![%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's okay for you, because you're nothing but a hippo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's a hippo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's hand⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's hands. One of them is rubbing the rock, and the other is–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't even say anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the place they call the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's sitting in front of the rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Sword Cape, aka Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the place we call the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This rocky place is nowhere for a lady such as yourself.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mind staying out of my way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-Why do you have my notebook?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Give it back! The only thing more important to me than this is my own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She took it.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has nothing to do with me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you mind not bothering me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I try to appreciate the time I have to myself.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why would you show me that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess this had nothing to do with her.)[%p]
