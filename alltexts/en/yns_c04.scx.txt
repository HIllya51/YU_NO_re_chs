[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi should be at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to get in there, quick![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already late. Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already late. Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not in my nature to just sit around the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, where should I look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is back home⋯so I think I had better talk to her quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and talk to Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A place Mio would go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not around downtown. I checked all the shops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right, sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's searching.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would help him relax.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which reminds me⋯ I wonder where Ayumi went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure Ayumi isn't at home anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi got called into Geo Technics by Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder about that⋯ You could say it's a bad feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it a bad idea to let Ayumi go alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't get into Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I could get inside if I had something to let me in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's as bright as always outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, where am I going now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nice weather again today. You wouldn't believe all that fuss about lightning storms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't be able to rest until I find that bastard and ask him what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If my predictions might come true, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to find him fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For the time being, where should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just where was Ayumi called away to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's freezing outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside of my home again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It's as cold as always outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she had something to do, which means someone called her over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be her office?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry and give the medicine to Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*shiver* It sure is cold out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, a place that sells headache medicine, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I go home soon? Ayumi will worry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's freezing outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already late. I wonder if Ayumi's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, she did tell me to come home early today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm totally breaking my promise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little cold outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home. Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there. It's a moron, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Who are you calling a moron?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, don't point at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's what I should ask. Why are you here? Near the chief's house of all places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tell you. That's because this is my house.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why is this your house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's, uh⋯well⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hahahah, I win.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy stupid?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]So the chief still hasn't come home yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said something about the TV station or something, didn't she?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I only dropped her off at the TV station. Don't know what happened after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would he brag about it.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Fine, I can tell her about it later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'll be going now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hey wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi headed downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should've asked him why Ayumi went to the TV station.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A picture of Ayumi. Why is this on the ground here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Toyotomi dropped it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would that asshole have a picture of Ayumi with him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy is more of a stalker than I expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Holding onto this won't help me, and Toyotomi's already gone. Darn, what do I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little cold outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi told me to hurry home, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside of my home again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside. What next?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside of my home again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That asshole, Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's number one stalker.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What was with that reaction? Are you feeling guilty about something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯it's just⋯ew.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nah, you know I'm really honest, right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'll appreciate it if you didn't tap my shoulder like that. By the way, is the chief home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The chief?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The office chief, Mrs. Arima. Your distant relative.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's my stepmother.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy kinda pisses me off.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Do you know where she went?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. (Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I see. Hmmph, I shall ease the chief's mind![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that guy okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll use this device to find the old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where should I look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I search the endless parallel worlds?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be some kind of clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Old man, I'm gonna find you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯is she back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is still out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I was going to Geo Technics to check and see.[%p]
