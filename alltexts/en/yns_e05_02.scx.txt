[name]Eriko[line]Can we resume what we talked about yesterday?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]About Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about her?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's a lot about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems so serious all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Man, Hatano really threw a problem my way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've got a pile of problems on my plate. I'm just about over capacity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so funny, Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry, it's faculty business.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not fair.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In either way, we can't let it alone. Can you go talk to Hatano for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I heard that Hatano stayed at your house overnight. You're interested in her, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why me? That's a homeroom teacher's job, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How about I buy you ramen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said that yesterday.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How about I buy you steak then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not standing in a breadline during the Great Depression! I don't like people taking care of everything with gifts or money.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then what do you want me to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, how about a heartfelt kiss?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aagh!
[name]Eriko[line]How about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]U-Um, y-you know⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're more inexperienced than I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the problem! Don't you have any shame, Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I guess I could say the same to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, just do it for me, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk, some teacher⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You say that, but you're grinning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thoughts and actions don't always match up.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, but you're excited now, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you did reward me beforehand. Plus, I am interested in her.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Eep! I gotta go[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Were you just talking to the school physician, Ms. Takeda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Why do you ask?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm⋯no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Wipe your lips. You look undignified.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seemed like you were staring at her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I asked her something last night. About what happened to her parents.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They died.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you ever seen her room before?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels completely empty. There's not a drop of life anywhere inside the room.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I talked to her this morning–[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You met with her last night and also this morning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]At her place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So that means you woke up together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That has nothing to do with anything right now.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, it doesn't?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay. Yes, I stayed at her place.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You little scoundrel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me say this though. I just spent the night there⋯ I didn't do anything at all.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course. There's nothing to feel guilty about staying at a single lady's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say it like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, I'll pursue the details of that later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it really necessary for me to explain?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know how much I should talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Especially about my old man.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There are plenty of inexplicable things about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's not normal to admit that stuff.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What else?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* I really shouldn't be telling you this, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't tell anyone.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wonder why I can tell things to you? You're easier to talk to than even the other teachers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm glad to hear it. Let's kiss.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, don't pucker up your lips like some weirdo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The thing about her is her school transfer history⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her transfer history?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah. Before transferring to Sakaimachi Academy, she was attending the school in the town over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She apparently transferred into that school as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So she's transferred a lot. That's not too uncommon, you know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, if it's under 10 times.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]10 times?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She transferred 10 times?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's just the number I found in her records. Before that, it's like no one knows anything about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]10 times? Why would anyone need to transfer that many times?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seems like she's never been in a single place for long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it has something to do with her guardians? Like their jobs or something?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, it can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's something even more interesting in her records about that. She's only been transferring to schools around Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only around this town?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. She's transferred to each school, one by one, in a big circle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's transferred over 10 times.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And they were all around Sakaimachi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could this mean?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]First, about that rumor you mentioned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seems they were quite easy to confirm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Really?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Rumors always have some truth to them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In other words, she's friendly with numerous, unnamed boys, and has dated a man old enough to be her own father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, according to current laws, a confession doesn't automatically render you guilty.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I know that. Of course, I would never criticize her without proof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, I don't know why she would admit to such rumors.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a good point.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She said that if it's causing problems, she is willing to leave the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would it cause problems?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When private matters go public, it's always a problem. A female student committing prostitution would be scandalous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you don't have proof of that yet.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If she fixes her lifestyle right now, then everything would be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She easily admitted what she was doing, so I doubt it'll go that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯it didn't seem like she accepted defeat, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She may not think much of the legality of it, but she knows how morally wrong it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she's only taken a step back to look at it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. She knows it's wrong logically, but that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So it's just a matter of time before she leaves this school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about her guardians?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They live in a different country right now. Can't get in contact with them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's what was written in the records.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this about Kanna?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure we don't need to go somewhere else to talk?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We're fine here. There are always visitors in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Walking out on your job, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]To be honest, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it that serious?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You could say that. But the painful truth is that I just don't have anyone else to talk to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is it strange for a teacher to consult with a student?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so. We're all humans. Let's just be frank with each other.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, when I'm with you it doesn't feel like we're teacher and student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, like we're man and woman?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, I'm trying to be serious here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's hear it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have a lot to talk to you about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is people watching one of your hobbies? You seem to do it all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is hidden by her hair, as usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, I want to be buried in those hills.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, what are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Curiosity is a good thing; that's something teachers are always telling me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]While we're on the subject, don't try sneaking your hand up to touch anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, no?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No means no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what about that magnificent fullness?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's bothering me, though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chest and those thighs. I don't know. It makes me a little excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not to mention that V-neck⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can feel your face pressed right between my breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a whole different kind of encounter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those clothes are pretty short.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you bending down in front of me like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You do look more official when you wear that coat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, I've never seen a doctor wear clothes as form-fitting as those.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even her bangs are long, so long I can hardly see her eyes. She tied the rest back and threw it over her shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong with your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets as always.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
