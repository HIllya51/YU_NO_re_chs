[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. Students pass by occasionally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. Looks like Ayumi isn't inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. I think Ayumi's inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do, climb up there and pretend to be a cicada?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll say this: I don't like the plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. It holds those electric cables in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I explaining things like a dictionary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see it from here, but I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top one says 「Stop」 and the bottom one says 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's any space in the streets of Japan, these signs spring up like bamboo shoots.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's also true that looking at green makes you feel calm and relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these plants are here almost apologetically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they're not hurting anything so whatever, but I just don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's pretty bad to destroy nature only to turn around and say 「we love nature.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guardrail is tough enough to take a hit from a car.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course our tax dollars paid for it, so if anyone were to break it, they'd have to pay to fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I also pay consumer taxes, so that makes this guardrail partly mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of person lives here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A traditional Japanese house with lots of nature around it. What a place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sparrows in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sparrows like to rest up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're stretched all around like spider webs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hot during the day, cold at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This asphalt is just like sand in the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really hot. I bet heat waves will come off it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The temperature of asphalt rises above 120 degrees at the peak of summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I'll be seeing mirages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school isn't very tall, but it's on a large property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd take a while to walk all the way around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this type of construction is called an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior design is actually pretty nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Sakaimachi Academy, the school I attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A safe name for a university, I guess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring up at the sky like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not many people around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, so I should have assumed that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about checking out Ryuuzouji's mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the only place I can think of with an inspection going would be at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll be able to see Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to talk to her. Let's go to the coastline![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are other places I need to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, now's not time to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to go see Ayumi first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi wasn't at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's back at the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're not doing that on purpose, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, I guess I'll go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of inspections⋯ Could there be an inspection going on inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though I know it's wrong, my feet won't stop moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go inside the school![%p]
