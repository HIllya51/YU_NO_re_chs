[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing we can do on our own right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we give up and head back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A huge rock is blocking our way forward.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It looks like we can't go any further.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how far we go, the walls are still damp⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wet here too. The water seems to be seeping out of the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Whew⋯ It's kind of steamy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's nothing I can do here now.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes⋯ Let's go back.[%p]
