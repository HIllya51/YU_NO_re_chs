[name]Takuya[line]Here's the front of the city hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I saw Ms. Eriko come this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she doesn't seem to be here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure she came this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ms. Eriko go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, I lost Ryuuzouji and the others, too. I'm really lacking finesse here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could they be in the hotel? Or⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That voice is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be asking you the same thing.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Are you the chief's son?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi? Why is he here?!)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, a student shouldn't be walking around this late at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have no right to lecture me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, what's this all about? This is⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We were just⋯having dinner here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dinner? At this hotel?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong, it's rude. Have some consideration for adults and the things they do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, please stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It was just a meeting about work, that's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to make excuses. It's not like I care.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, chief. We have unfinished business.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right. Takuya, I'm going back to the office, and then I'll be home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I won't be long, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Let's go, chief.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. See you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Ayumi with that idiot?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That really pisses me off. What the heck?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I lost Ms. Eriko, Ryuuzouji went off somewhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯and on top of all that, Ayumi was with that moron.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
