[name]Illia[line]Takuya⋯ I have something I need to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something to tell me?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What's wrong, looking around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Illia's bedroom.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's watching me from the bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is sleeping in bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it just me, or does she look like she's in pain?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were badly wounded. I thought you were a goner at first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those bandages around your head look bad⋯ Even though I'm the one who wrapped them.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You did this, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ It was just first aid.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Impressive treatment. Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beautiful hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Spread all over the bed⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Flowing hair⋯ It's beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder about her pointy ears, though⋯)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Are you staring at my ears?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No⋯ I wasn't looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia said she wanted to talk to me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll worry about it after I hear what she has to say.)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're hurt. You should take it easy.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Please. I want you to listen to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now is not a good time for that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks pretty serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't look like she's in the mood to mess around.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't someone besides Celes do it?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't someone train for it, like you did to become a knight? If someone trains to be a priestess, can't they eventually get the God to descend upon them?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]A priestess is not a position you can become⋯ It is passed down through generations. The ability relies on the talent they are born with⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Unless she has a child, Celes is the only one capable. Therefore⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm sorry, Illia.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think⋯ I can't stay here to guard this place and protect Celes. I don't have that much confidence in myself.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you do it, Illia? Once you get better, you can take her to the Imperial Capital and have her carry out the ritual.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]When Celes was attacked by that beast⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Why are you talking about that all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]No matter what it takes, you wanted to save Celes, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯yeah. Anyone would feel that way in that situation.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I see⋯ Thank you.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia?![%p]
[name]Illia[line]I just closed my eyes⋯ I'm a little tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't scare me like that. Geez.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I wrote a correspondence to the Imperial Capital. It's in my desk drawer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A correspondence? Oh, you mean a letter.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It confirms the priestess' presence and my successor as a knight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me tell you something⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I know. I can't force you. All I can do is trust in the goodness of your heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-Illia⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I'm awake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I have⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I have⋯a younger sister. Just one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]We live completely opposite lives. She says there is no God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]She says the God-Monarch should be removed from the government, she desires for the people to have control of their own lives.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wants a democracy.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I wonder what she is doing now. She never left my side when she was little⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I wish⋯ I wish I could see her. Just one last time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Illia![%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you asleep?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop messing around. If you're faking, I'll⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia, wake up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't sleep, you stupid idiot! Hey, I said wake up![%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you hear me? Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you leaving me alone? What kind of a knight would leave me alone in the wilderness?![%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Open your eyes! Hey!!![%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you⋯dead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you⋯ Are you really dead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone⋯ She's dead![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia! Open your eyes, you idiot!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it! I can't believe this! What am I supposed to do now?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm by myself here⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ce-Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia's dead.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you understand?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell am I supposed to do now?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was so much I wanted to ask her.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About this world⋯ And how to get home.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In a place like this⋯ Am I going to die in a place like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one on this frontier but you. I'm alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to die alone?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not alone?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I can't believe you're comforting me. You can't even speak.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You saved my life⋯ I can't thank you enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯ Until I can get home⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll grant your dying wish until I can find a way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll guard this frontier you called the Border and protect Celes. That's what you wanted, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But only until I can go home. I can't promise any more than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will look for a way home with everything I have. And I know I'll find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But until then, I'll do what you asked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That will be my thanks for saving my life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made a promise to Illia. I'll protect you until the day I go home.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But don't count on me too much. You saw what I was like when that monster attacked you, right? That's the extent of what I can do.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ What? You're still gonna count on me?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ But do you want to keep living out here?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what Illia said, you⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind. People can't help thinking about the past.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter who you are, I made a promise to Illia. As long as I'm here, I will protect you.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, until I find a way home⋯ Or until you tell me to stop.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that sound good to you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now, I'll patrol the area.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Luckily, it looks like we're the only people here. No one will complain if I dig some holes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I'll find a way home, somehow. Then, you should go back to where you came from. Okay?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. For now, let's give Illia a proper burial. We'll start everything else tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I don't need to say this, but we'll sleep separately. I'll let you use the bed.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything starts tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I promise I'll find my way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father used to train me hard. So my investigation skills aren't half bad. I don't miss even the smallest clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know there has to be a clue somewhere⋯ A clue to lead me home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know it⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]In four years, Dela Grantia will reign upon us⋯ By the sacred ritual, it shall rise within her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A god⋯in Celes' body? That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I got it. We have freedom of religion where I come from, so I won't make fun of it.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Four years, until the ritual takes place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]For the next four years⋯ I would like you to guard this place, the Border, instead of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you saying all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You are trained in swordsmanship. You can handle it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I'm worried about. I mean, you saw what I was like yesterday. I was frozen in terror like a coward.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You will be fine⋯ I know it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're overestimating me. I'm not up to this⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]To ensure that the ritual is carried out completely, invaders of the Border must be eliminated. That is our duty as knights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a knight. I don't have any title like that.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Being a knight is not about having a title. It's about having a strong desire to be a knight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I want you to protect the Priestess Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Impossible. Also, I have something more important to do.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]To return to your country beyond the Border⋯ Is that correct?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Then it would be wise for you to stay here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The fact that you appeared here means there is a chance you could return from somewhere nearby.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Please⋯*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Will you take the offer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do it. You said it yourself, there's a chance I can go home.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go straight home if I get the chance. This world is nothing but nonsense to me.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I'm not trying to stop you from going home. I'm only talking about while you are here in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The fact that Priestess Celes is here means that there is a reason she cannot be in the Imperial Capital⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A reason⋯ What reason?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I do not know⋯ The ritual must be carried out under her own will. But right now, she is out here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's boycotting it.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That may be the case⋯ It also may be something else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Once every few hundred years, Dela Grante suffers the wrath of mother nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to talk about that stuff right now.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Please⋯ I want you to hear this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The rage of mother nature is an unparalleled danger that only a priestess like Celes can prevent⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've said that before.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You felt that earthquake earlier, Takuya. Did you not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, yeah⋯ It was pretty big.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]They will only get bigger. And in the end, they will destroy Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]To let God descend upon her and use that power to calm the rage of mother nature⋯ Celes is the only person who can do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just superstition, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It is not superstition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, gods and all that⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You must not blaspheme the name of God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The almighty God⋯ Dela Grantia will descend. And she will save us all from the rage of mother nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela Grantia?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Hundreds of years ago⋯ And even before that, God descended to reign upon this land. And Dela Grante was saved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Once in a few hundred years⋯ God descends?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But wait⋯ What about that monster?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That was a beast attacking from beyond the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hang on, that wasn't just any beast![%p]
[name]Illia[line]It is our duty as knights to protect the Imperial Capital from these beasts. We must protect the Imperial Capital and ensure that the ritual is safely carried out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ritual?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*cough cough*⋯ Ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you all right? I'll bring you some water. I'm worried you might be dehydrated. You're looking pale.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Wait⋯please wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, why?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Listen, Takuya⋯ You who came from beyond the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]She⋯the woman you call Celes⋯is a priestess who belongs at the castle in the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't speak, you need to regain your strength. I'll bring some water.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Please⋯ Listen to me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Who⋯bandaged my head?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did, though I didn't do a very good job.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I see⋯ Thank you. I feel slightly better now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm honored that a knight would say that to me.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Stop⋯ I am not as great as you might think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are modest, that's for sure. I just stood there holding that sword while Celes was in trouble⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That is because I was trained to defend others. You did not go through such training⋯ That is the only difference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]But now you have seen real battle. I know you will do better next time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next time?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she saying?)[%p]
