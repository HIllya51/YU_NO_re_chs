[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet. Nobody around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are they holding remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor is so quiet. Are remedial classes even being held right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope Yuuki is doing a good job filling in for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sitting in the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof, I'm getting old![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bench; a place to take a load off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do old men always make so much noise when they sit down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I feel like that's a deep question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I think this is mostly for Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what I really don't understand is why there's so many cigarette butts in the ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I thought smoking was banned on campus grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, they never explained what the penalty was for smoking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this point there's only some kind of academic penalty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ashtray for the ashes of chain-smoked cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why is there an ashtray in the middle of a school hallway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stairs to go directly down to the school gate are through the emergency exit on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I follow these directions⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I run into the glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know: it's the sign that indicates emergency exits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never used this thing before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I guess not having to use it is a good thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hose wrapped up inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light's on. What a waste of electricity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This light's on even during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They should think of something a little more eco-friendly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light. It's on even during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so bright out. Is it really necessary for the light to be on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I think this is mostly for Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what I really don't understand is why there's so many cigarette butts in the ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I thought smoking was banned on campus grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, they never explained what the penalty was for smoking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this point there's only some kind of academic penalty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ashtray for the ashes of chain-smoked cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why is there an ashtray in the middle of a school hallway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Down leads to the main hall, up goes to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're convenient stairs that let you go up or down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing too special, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a sticker indicating the emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you're inside, this is an exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you look at it from the outside, it'd be an entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The emergency exit sticker is stuck right on the window glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is obviously an emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A familiar indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're all over the place, just like convenience stores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pitch black outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somebody must be cleaning this every day. The window is always nice and clean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is nice and wide.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this much light being let in, it sure gets bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A handrail. I can't take it home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The handrail is here so you don't go flying off of the stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, I've never held this handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night. The hallway is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. There's no one here but club members and people attending remedial classes, so it's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here. Everybody must have gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's locked at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, looks like I can't get down from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get out of this emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just one big jump down to the front gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll try going there for a change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go up to the roof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll go down to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is locked, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's closed. Well, of course it would be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty late at night, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think anyone's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lab. Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
