[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a water tank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There appears to be a bunch of tubes on top of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What the heck is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what is this stone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is what Kaori was talking about⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]The Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry I'm late. I got distracted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Distracted?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I had to make some arrangements. Thanks for being patient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now, let's have a look-see at what we've come here for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Aah⋯fantastic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amazing⋯ It's glowing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The pale blue glimmer of life⋯ This is the Hypersense Stone's breath, the whisper of the stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stone itself is emanating light?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. It's fantastic. I finally found it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Finally?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what is this stone?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's called a Hypersense Stone. This is its crystallized form.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Obviously, that's not its official name, but only what it's known by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A Hypersense Stone⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The real goal of Geo Technics is mining this stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will they do with all these rocks?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This stone has some strange properties. Apparently, it reacts to human consciousness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Human consciousness?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. Nobody knows why this stone lies buried beneath Sakaimachi. Some say it's a great mystery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who says that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A certain someone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]However, this stone has a weakness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A weakness?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, it's a very unstable ore whose composition greatly changes when it touches air or water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why is it here like this?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This one is crystallized, so it's fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The crystallization process is what your stepmother has been researching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯did this?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]She did. However, this is the only sample.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the first time I've heard about any of this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That just means she hasn't told you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're saying that Ayumi has been researching this stone?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup. And she's been doing it under Dr. Koudai Arima's request.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]From what I've heard, it seems that understanding this stone was a high priority for Dr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who did you hear that from?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe⋯ I wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This stone is already crystallized, so it's safe to take it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's something a thief would do.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, I do plan to steal it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's all right. Stealing this won't put your stepmother in a predicament. I don't know what'll happen to the security guards, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's the issue here⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We're just adding theft to breaking in, and destruction of property. As long as we don't kill anyone, it's all the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It looks like we're going to have to break this water tank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks tough⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Come on, Takuya, you do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you plan on making me, a woman, do something so rough?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only at times like this do you pretend to be a damsel in distress.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. Come on, hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what Kaori is after?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like some kind of stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori claimed it was called a hyper⋯something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, a Hypersense Stone. Is that what this stone is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's shining pale blue⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look like tubes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It appears that they're connected directly to the water tank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a projector⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing displayed right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a large screen projector.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on screen right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of device is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of tubes drooping from it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like they're connected to the water tank below.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of machines here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There really are a lot of machines here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what they're used for, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious about that water tank in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori called this place a 「laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means they must be researching something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As for what they're researching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the thing in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing there⋯ Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a Jewel. It's one of the jewels that go in the Reflector the old bastard left me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Jewel 7][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Jewel 7][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing special here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing special here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
