[name]Takuya[line]The front of that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. It's okay to go closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the tapestry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I can get a little closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the tapestry Mio was talking about.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Every time I see this, I get chills.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I know how you feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the tapestry Mio was talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man saw this too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a painting on the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture in the form of a tapestry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can take a closer look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little bit dirty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's in the middle?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's an ordinary wall.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Compared to the wall in the middle, it's a slightly dull color.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can feel years and years in this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There seems to be no meaning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are some letters written here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Chinese characters, so I can't read it.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It doesn't have any meaning. I think it means something like 「Good Day.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ordinary families have nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a transom.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's very common to Japanese-style homes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no tool to cut it down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is a big pillar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what will happen if I cut this down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I want to try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are several on the ceiling of this mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a beam.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The large rings in the wood grain make it clear these came from immense trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The height of the ceiling would suggest there's a second floor.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's nothing here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a closet, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nothing at all.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's clothing and something he needs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He sold it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there nothing in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this a tea closet?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I open it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing in here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This may as well be a vacant house.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not vacant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hardwood floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to slide across it in my socks like a kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The floor is hardwood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The best way to describe it would be to call it hardwood flooring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the living room of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems kind of unnatural though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait. Where are you going? Don't you want to see this thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I wanted to see the tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any items to use here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time.[%p]
