[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]All I can hear is the sound of dripping water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I look around too much, I'll slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to be careful not to faaaaaaaall⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, you're so funny. Sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the dampness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty damp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be from the water dripping down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I should go back⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]To the exit? Let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
