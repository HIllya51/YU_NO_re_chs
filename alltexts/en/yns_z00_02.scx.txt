[name]Takuya[line]A woman is on the ground, right in front of my eyes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am in the woods⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel way outta place in this situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who this lady in front of me is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems that she is not as scared as before⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's talk to her now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A woman who can't speak a word⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe, it's not that she can't talk, but she doesn't want to talk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At first she was terrified, but now she's looking better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should ask her something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I've seen her somewhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]

[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hair is gold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lovely, but⋯ This is not the time to be staring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Blonde hair⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A foreigner? Or maybe it's too shallow to think that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could be just an older lady who bleached her hair too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Golden hair⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Blonde⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beautiful, blonde hair⋯[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Blonde hair⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A foreigner? Or maybe it's too shallow to think that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could be just an older lady who bleached her hair too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I brushed mud off her thighs already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, I shouldn't be staring at them anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her pale legs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are caked with mud⋯ Here, let me see.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I won't eat you.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, good to go. Now, you are clean.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Oh boy, she looks worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop staring⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I brushed mud off her thighs already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, I shouldn't be staring at them anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her pale legs⋯[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Oh boy, now she looks worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop staring⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it⋯ Let's communicate with this woman, right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great, now she's terrified of me.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great, now she's terrified of me.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, just once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope, I changed my mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Might die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Nice vibes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, a dive, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am telling you, I can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no way I can do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, to gather all the information so far.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your name is Celes and you don't know Sakaimachi or about the cliff and you don't even know me, right?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you don't know anything but your name.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Sorry I scared you. I have plans, so I've gotta go now.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should return home before the sunset. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is, where is this forest located?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a mountain path, but it looks like a pretty deep forest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Without a map or a compass, I don't even know whether this is Japan or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not sure if this is Japan⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Stop it. No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this isn't Japan, then⋯[%p]
*scoot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you following me?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about your house?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* That's enough. Anyway, you should go home as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? What do you wanna say?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you, I'm going to⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sob*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, don't give me that look, okay?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, where are you from?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, if you don't say anything⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sob*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯ You're making me feel like I'm the bad guy.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay. I lost, you win. You are amazing.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this person?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She is stuck to me. Always right besides me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyhow, I just walked straight ahead and it was a sheer cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means, if I walk back, then things might be a little different⋯[%p]
*scoot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that smile?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, it's okay to go backwards?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't have many choices anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My only choices are to go forward or go backward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's walk⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, for some reason, I got myself a strange companion⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what's gonna happen now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That lady⋯ She is following me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like a little puppy, you know⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Following you everywhere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, if she were in the world where I come from, she wouldn't stand a chance against all the weirdos⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She does not know the world⋯ Maybe she's more than just shy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The world where I come from?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My⋯world⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this⋯not my world?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nonsense⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I am just a little bit tired.)[%p]
*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Where are you pointing⋯ Ah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright opening in the forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯ An exit?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The forest⋯ Can I get out of it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The woods⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is not⋯not Sakaimachi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this even Japan?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I wanted to ask was⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know where this place is?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Are you a woman?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Am I scary?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really scary?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thought about it for a second, and then a 「No」⋯ So, not super scary, but you're still wary of me.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ Anyway, it seems like my plan worked really well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, we shouldn't do that too often. My nostrils would open so wide I'd look like a mountain gorilla.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do anything to you. I promise.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I have a few questions.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just answer as much as you can. Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Well, first of all⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, see, look at my face.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not scary at all. Look, funny face![%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Planet of the Apes, oowa oowa.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My name is Lupin the Thiiiiiiird.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then, this is it! I'm going to pick my nose with my big toe, watch![%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel so stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope no one is watching⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just for a second⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going to pick my nose with my big toe again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch⋯ My nostrils are sore.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's working. Good, 「pick my nose with my big toe」 is gonna be our means of communication.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't speak, can you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you understood! Did you just nod?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are a man?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you just shake your head like, 「No」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see, shaking your head means no and nodding means yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, what am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I figured out how to communicate with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's your name?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. My name is Takuya.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, say something![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay, don't worry. You are fine. It's okkaaay, there, there.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like dealing with a startled animal⋯*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, this woman is my only hope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ Let's talk to her a little bit more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know where this is?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She sells sea shells by the seashore![%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, duh. What the heck![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who this lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be so alarmed. I won't do anything to you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are safe. I won't do anything.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't yell at you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am telling you, I won't do anything![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry! Uhm⋯so⋯what is going on here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I've found out that this place is not Sakaimachi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's ask some more questions⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this Sakaimachi?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know a place called 「Sakaimachi?」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know⋯ How about Triangle Mountain and Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, some people don't even know the name of the prime minister.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There might be someone who does not know the name of their own city⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that means she really doesn't know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This lady in front of me doesn't know where Sakaimachi is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what exactly is this place?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I have to think of a better way to ask. The question needs to be answered with a yes or no. Ja or nein.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think we've asked enough about the cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there⋯ That's where I almost fell from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know why it's in such a place?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the same as asking why there's a mountain here. It exists.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That cliff that I almost fell off of⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How come something like that is here?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's difficult to ask questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to phrase them in a way that she can answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I got her name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Okay, let's try the next letter - 「Q」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「R」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「S」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯is it 「S」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, 「C-E-L-E-S」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「C-E-L-E-S」⋯ Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your name doesn't sound very Japanese⋯ Celes. I guess you aren't Japanese after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great, well, at least I got her name: Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's ask some more questions⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「J」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「K」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯ I am getting tired. Let's speed it up. How about any letters A-B-C-D?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, next set. How about E-F-G-H?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Next set is I-J-K-L⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, you have one?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「I」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「J」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「K」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「L」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's 「L.」 So, your name sounds like 「Cell.」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it? The first letter is 「C,」 right?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Second letter is 「E.」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, 「Cel⋯」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Ceeeel⋯?」[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see, I have to elongate the 「E」 sound.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is so much work⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I will be patient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's ask her again, in between other questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A, B⋯and then the next letter is 「C.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]C⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ce?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Ce!」 That's your name![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, but you just⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see. This is just the first letter. So there are more letters to follow.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, so I know the first syllable is 「Ce.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I'll figure out what comes next.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「D」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「R」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「S」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯ Ah, that was just a sigh, not a guess.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「E」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「F」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「G」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「H」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯ It's taken me so long to get the first syllable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if she has a long name with dozens of letters?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will die of old age before I find out your whole name⋯ Sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, I'll show her some names and have her check if it's one of them⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so. There are way too many names in this universe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your name⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have a name?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is your name⋯ That won't work.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, yes! How about guessing each syllable one by one?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I say the first syllable of your name, and if I get it right or get very close, you can nod.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's go in alphabetical order, shall we? 「A」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Ba」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Be」?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]「Bi」?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, surprisingly or obviously⋯*sigh* This will take some time and effort.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take it slow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, it's so hard to ask a question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, ask her name and⋯ No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way of communicating is by yes or no, positive or negative.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Questions that make her speak are meaningless⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no use in asking her about me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know me⋯ Do you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My name?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, this is the first time you've seen me.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course. It's the first time I am meeting her, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
