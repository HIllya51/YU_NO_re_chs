[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here. I guess I have to take care of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hair always looks so soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's a little sweaty and mussed right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's hair is so long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sweat's making it all stick to her face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems calm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But as usual, she's wearing a pained expression.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to do something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's got such an uncomfortable look on her face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And with her dressed the way she is, I'm having some tempting thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's got such a pained look to her. I have to do something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she's in pain, and she's sweating a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should wipe the sweat away, so she doesn't get a chill.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah⋯ Ahh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, you're worrying me, Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you keep making sounds like that, I can't help reacting the way I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if that rumor about her having a lot of guy friends is true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I thinking? This isn't the time to be wondering about that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she's in a lot of pain. I have to do something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I assumed it was because that bastard Toyotomi knocked her down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she's running a fever, and her breathing is ragged. Maybe she has a cold.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh, I have no reason to get so worked up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But when I look at her, I feel kind of funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not getting turned on or anything. How do I explain it? Um⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the hell am I explaining this to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to help her, so she's not in pain anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her face is red too. She must really be hurting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she has a fever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko said something about that. She goes to the infirmary to rest sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a headband.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be looking there right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hands look so soft and smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She shifts occasionally, but it looks uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she'll get better if I hold her hand.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop. Doing weird stuff like that when a girl is passed out is deplorable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bedding is damp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be from the sweat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's sleeping there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a dangerous position to be in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's sleeping there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the springs in that are pretty hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be good for your back, but I like something a little more soft and mild.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I keep talking about that, people will know that I sleep in the infirmary all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll just wipe the sweat off her upper body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't really close my eyes while I do this. I need to hurry up and take off her clothes so she can cool down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, she's really sweating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would've been bad if I hadn't done something. She could get pneumonia or something if she catches a chill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's just pouring sweat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Kanna really⋯sick?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what kind of disease gives you a fever and makes you sweat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that's a normal cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I think that's good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's still sweating, but she's a lot better off now that I've wiped her off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now I just have to wait for Ms. Eriko to get back from her walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The way she's sweating can't be safe for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somehow she still looks sexy. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ Here I go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I nervous about? I'm not some little kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is what happens when I let my mind wander.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll close my eyes. That should make me feel a little better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, I swear this is purely for medical purposes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Aah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First I'll loosen this ribbon, then undo the zipper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I just take them off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm taking them off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I messed up. Her skirt came off too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm coming up with some pretty poor excuses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Her uniform is open and showing her chest, and below her waist, well⋯*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now she looks even sexier than before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What am I gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I think these clothes are the problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Won't she feel a lot better if I take them off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take off her clothes and wipe the sweat off to drop her body temperature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At least her breathing should settle down. Yeah, a doctor would definitely do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm wasting a lot of time making up all these dumb excuses. She's in danger. I need to get my priorities straight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is purely a medical issue. That's it. It just seems weird because I'm making a big deal about taking off her uniform.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I messed it up. Anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By taking off her clothes, I can lower her body temperature and ease her breathing. Yeah, that's perfect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I talking to?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That uniform looks restrictive.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it hindering her breathing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might feel better if I take it off⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's dumb. What am I thinking? What timing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already wiped the sweat off her. It's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to stare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already wiped the sweat away from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I probably shouldn't be staring so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I just have to wipe away the sweat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I can wipe her down with some of the gauze lying around.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a lot of sweat. It just keeps coming.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know why I'm letting myself get so worried about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where is all that sweat coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she has a cold or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I guess it's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pretty beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She has such trim, beautiful legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-no. I shouldn't let my mind wander about things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's smooth thighs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to look, but I shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to take care of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to look at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you looking at? Geez.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really wish she wouldn't make that sound when she's dressed like this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll start with the uniform on top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should start with the skirt?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First I'll get the uniform on top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her skirt⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to roll up her skirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But maybe the skirt's making her uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That must be it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even so, if I take her skirt off like this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I justifying myself to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that I'm not interested, but it's wrong to do that to a girl that's sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I have to take this off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, I shouldn't get ahead of myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not right, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to be more concerned with Kanna's condition than the state of her panties.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm glad I've made it this far, but it's time to stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just leave Kanna like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Scanty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Undies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Panties.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]White.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get it together![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]White![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I yelling about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already said it's white.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's white.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]White⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]White⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to quit ogling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if it's not the case⋯*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, my eyes just go right back to there, don't they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What am I looking at? Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a cute bra.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be looking at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her breasts are petite and perfect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like a total a creep staring like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to be looking at that kind of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This wouldn't have happened if Ms. Eriko was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I laid her down on the infirmary bed for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's resting in the infirmary bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God, Ms. Eriko is never around when you need her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? I just noticed she's wearing a necklace.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know most ladies wear necklaces these days, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a blue gem. It's kind of strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's beautiful. I wonder what kind of gem it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a blue gemstone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I've seen it somewhere before, but maybe I'm just imagining things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Where did you see it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh! Y-You're awake?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]L-Listen, this was all for purely medical reasons⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. You took care of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah. I just saw your underwear a little bit. I didn't touch you or anything⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a school announcement.[%p]
[name]Broadcast[line](Kanna Hatano, Kanna Hatano⋯)[%p]
[name]Broadcast[line](Please see Ms. Eriko Takeda in the teacher's lounge immediately.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Broadcast[line](I repeat. Kanna Hatano, please see Ms. Eriko Takeda in the teacher's lounge immediately.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does Ms. Eriko want?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! You need to lie down.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm okay. I feel much better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Can you turn around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I want to get dressed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, s-sorry. I didn't realize.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've already seen her in her underwear, but she's still shy about changing in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's just her nature.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Still though⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could Ms. Eriko want?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She called specifically for Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It couldn't be about that rumor, could it?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not looking.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can we talk until you're dressed?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯ I need to get my heart rate back to normal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But that's hard to do with Kanna around.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whenever I talk to her, I get this strange feeling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I could talk to her with no problem if it was Mio.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you gotten used to this school?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pretty much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know you transferred just before the break.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything. I may not exactly be a shoulder to cry on or anything, but I can give you advice.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't what I planned to talk about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I froze up when the time came.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You carried me all the way here, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. You passed out right there on the coast. I was pretty freaked out.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I ask what you were doing at the coastline?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Stopping the construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were there to protest it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was your family involved in the accident?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I'm intruding.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It wasn't my family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to protect the environment or something?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. To prevent more accidents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Accidents?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. A lot of accidents happen at that construction site. If the construction stops, there won't be any more accidents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha! What a strange answer.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's⋯hard to talk to.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you always get fevers like that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]From time to time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From time to time⋯ Right.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's been happening more often lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I should just ask about the rumors.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sure that's what Ms. Eriko wants anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But how should I ask? 「So, tell me about your many, many boyfriends I've heard so much about.」)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No. Of course I can't ask that. *sigh*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested, but I have no right to invade her privacy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, I never would've known this if that idiot Yuuki hadn't said anything.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't ask about your boyfriends or anything![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! I mean, uh⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You can ask me again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]About my necklace.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the blue thing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You said you saw it before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I just thought that I did.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Where did you see it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do I put it? I guess it's like deja vu. I don't know why, but I remember it from somewhere.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um⋯ Somewhere secure, I think?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might've been somewhere my old man brought me. He used to bring me to lots of places.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Your father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, he likes to call himself a historian. Well, he liked to call himself a historian. Past tense.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I heard he passed away. My condolences.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He doesn't deserve your sympathy.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Your father wasn't deserving of sympathy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure not everyone would agree with me, but I know how I feel about him.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Do you still have remedial classes today, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. At least I plan to. I have no plans.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she was trying to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
