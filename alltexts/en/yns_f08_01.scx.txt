[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew no one was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I just rip off the numbers on the bottom, it'll look fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm much more interested in the girl above the numbers though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A teacher must have drawn this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some weird drawing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I turn this, the door should open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not really something that needs explaining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A doorknob. Not a door Bob.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's Bob?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. I hope it doesn't place me under arrest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. The teachers must be using it to drink stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this going to stay here all summer vacation?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A completely empty fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Any beverages inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here. It's not even plugged in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lamp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lamp that you can bend and turn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bunch of notes on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't any documents I particularly want to take a look at.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're just a bunch of documents all piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯what about this one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this? 「Love Slaves」? That's a crazy title.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I read the whole thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many books here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I've read this one before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「An Introduction to S&M for Beginners.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is that softcore stuff that's popular. I was worried when Ayumi found my copy, but she ended up reading it too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, it's very deep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would a book like this be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this document?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A Newspaper Read Upside Down is Still a Newspaper.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's so much stuff in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, this thing looks like a phonebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「An Introduction to History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A truly boring book, I can tell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, this is the textbook Mitsuki was using in her history class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A Book of Hard to Understand History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Books that say 「Easy to Understand」 are never easy, but this one is a whole lot different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Textbooks usually go the safe route, so they're all filled with the same theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, this book explains all the lies and mistakes in textbooks up until now, as well as all kinds of theories, and really explains everything in an easily understandable way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't my old man tell me to read this a long time ago?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Author: Koudai Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh, I shouldn't have read that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A memo board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are notes and schedules on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks messy, but these things are pretty convenient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A regular analog clock. I can hear the seconds tick by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an analog clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's weird to see, considering how everything is digitized nowadays.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are even clocks that have digital needles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A chair. I prefer sitting in a chariot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The teachers use these chairs, I bet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mitsuki's chair was the one in the back. *sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stinks. Thinking about it, I'm pretty sure this was some dirty old man's seat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Surprisingly, I've studied at this desk before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A desk⋯or a table?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, who cares.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a regular, fluorescent light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fluorescent light for the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are shut to block the setting sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The setting sun shines right in this room. That's why the blinds are always shut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be cool if money came falling down while I stared at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's going to fall down so I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A vent⋯for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. I better not hold a lighter up to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. It sprays out water if a fire breaks out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't think it's too bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, who's that stud in the mirror?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last time I said that, Mitsuki kept asking me, 「Where?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It may be a locker, but I don't know if I'm locked and loaded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This locker is deeper than it looks. Seems big enough for two people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bookshelf filled with specialized books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but specialized books in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at it makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This room sure is a mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the teachers hang out, so they could keep it a little cleaner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go outside.[%p]
