[name]Takuya[line]I'm on the fifth floor, in front of the door for number 501.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the door won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a steel door. It looks pretty tough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The nameplate says 「Hatano.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a plate with a name written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「Hatano.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a pretty dangerous home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll check inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯ No one answered when I rang the doorbell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one came when I rang the doorbell, so I guess nobody's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If nobody's home, then turning the knob won't do anything, will it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll ring the doorbell first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ Shouldn't I ring the doorbell first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not good enough friends with her to just barge in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's answering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way she's not home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One more time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. Did Kanna go out in her condition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, that's weird. Is no one home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a quiet apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I shouldn't judge, but it's a lot cleaner than I expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The superintendent must be attentive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With the management fee plus the maintenance fee, it must be super expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. It won't work unless I look from the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's designed to prevent you from seeing in from the outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just how it works.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's illuminating the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light is illuminating the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's interior design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, I don't really understand art.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I don't know the value of paintings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Paintings hung in places like this are usually some innocuous landscape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And landscapes don't really excite anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means anything is okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling light⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light that's set in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lighting up the hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a plant, the same kind you see all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of those typical indoor plants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's kinda hard to breathe in here. Maybe because they're not sucking up enough carbon dioxide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a decorative ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? There aren't any cigarette butts inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is just a decoration?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's an ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna doesn't smoke, does she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I here just to stare at this thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have other things to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I press this, a siren will sound, then a firetruck, the police, and a bunch of busybodies will show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet even married couples would stop enjoying their 「quality time」 just to see what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I push it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a fire hose coiled up like a snake inside here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even saying it is kinda gross.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door I need isn't the one in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's no nameplate, does that mean that no one lives there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go outside.[%p]
