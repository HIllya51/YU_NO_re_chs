[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did she mean when she said I was different?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What's the matter, Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm? Ah, Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with Ryuuzouji's attitude?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's acting like he forgot what happened at the shrine.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh, I'm sure a young man like you has all kinds of things to do, but try not to worry your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She told me to take care of you. You're taking remedial classes, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Ayumi now?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Our meeting was over a while ago. Hmm, I don't know where she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Are you looking for her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, I am.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I think she said she was going to an inspection. She seems really busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's go, Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, sir.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do your best, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]((This evening, in the laboratory.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯you got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Mitsuki both strike me as a little strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Ayumi told me it was an inspection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's inspecting that construction site?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it, lovely Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you calling me that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm. Mitsuki, then.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have something to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you know I'm all about that pillow talk.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm being serious![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope it's not bad news.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. What did you want to talk about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Can I meet you at the laboratory this evening?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, at the laboratory? Can't wait to get me alone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, I'm trying to be serious here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw, my heart was starting to beat pretty fast⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, it's going to stop beating if you keep this up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Smart man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And healthy too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This seems like a serious conversation.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Not as serious as you are now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Something is strange about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange? Like what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Something's⋯unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Am I⋯different today?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Stop staring at me. It's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean? I'm a student at this school.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's not what I meant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know what to say. You're a little strange, that's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, it's pretty rude to tell me right to my face that I'm strange.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No! I'm sorry! That's not what I meant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I know. You're saying I look too serious, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you do have bad news.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Pfft![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not too serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know how to explain what happened⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's calmly smiling at me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong? You're staring at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could handle just about any hairstyle, even a mohawk.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think you'd look good no matter what.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hairstyle makes you look like someone's secretary.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha! I am a secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez, I can't take my eyes off her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Boink.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What does 「boink」 mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯that's just my way of saying I find you attractive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can tell. You're turning about ten shades of red right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am not. That's not even possible![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is clothing that revealing even allowed here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I don't mind though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That top you've got on is an interesting style⋯those slits⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. It's great for just about everything, and it's really comfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not what I'm worried about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That blouse, vest, and skirt are a matched set.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's called a three-piece; it's fairly expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty sharp. Looks good on you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ha⋯ Thank you. It was a gift from my boss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your boss?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was a gift from Ryuuzouji? Tsk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I feeling like this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her skin has such a nice sheen to it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not even a smudge of lipstick is out of place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that little red scar?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Huh, you're lying![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the liar⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks familiar.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No comment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Too bad she quit part-time lecturing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So your competitor is Ms. Eriko, the school physician.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You mean that glamorous teacher, Ms. Takeda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, the teacher who always goes around with a cigarette in her mouth.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll consider it a compliment to be compared to that lovely woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're elegant, but Ms. Eriko has a great body.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't say things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're one of the top two most beautiful women in this school.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thanks.[%p]
