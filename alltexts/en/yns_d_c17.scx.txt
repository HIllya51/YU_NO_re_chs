[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I wasn't expecting to find a staircase under the sarcophagus⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the exit Professor Imagawa was talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the exit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where it goes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I'll just turn into a mummy if I stick around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can do is move forward.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Uhnn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, I'll bring Mitsuki with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I'll see what's down these stairs for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could be up ahead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still in the cave.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* My back hurts. Mitsuki is quite heavy. Feels like about a hundred and twenty pounds.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A hundred and ten⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*zzz⋯zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I just imagine that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's scraping my back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought Mitsuki's boobs were softer than this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she have something in her clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I have to find Mio.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You only care about Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*zzz⋯zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I hearing things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's getting brighter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would it be getting brighter? Is there some kind of automatic ignition system?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not it. That light isn't coming from a lantern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be sunlight from outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's ridiculous. When did I suddenly get outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's getting brighter, and brighter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I reaching outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lake is glimmering.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's the light of rare metal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha⋯ We finally found it. This is the location of the gemstone vein.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What gemstones are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh⋯ I wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, what is this light?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said something about this being the light of rare metal, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you seen this lake before?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I just made an assumption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An assumption?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I assumed that there would be an ore vein like this underground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ore vein? What's that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji was looking for this⋯and I've found it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, look in front of you. The pretty princess makes her appearance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Mio?! Hey!!![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ You're alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew the history fanatic wouldn't kick the bucket that easily.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, a tearful reunion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, quit wiggling around. Something's scraping my back.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Scraping?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Could it be this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯what are you⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry, Takuya. This is how it's meant to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she talking about⋯?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't go against him⋯ I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Him⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could she mean⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ I'm dizzy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki⋯)
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Now⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Wake up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Time. To. Wake up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Let me sleep a little longer.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Wake up⋯ It's time to wake up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just give me one more hour. Pleeaase⋯*mumble*[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Wake up⋯ Wake up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmm⋯ Ayumi⋯*mumble*[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]I said wake up⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Wake up, Arima![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, that hurt⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]I'm not Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The feel of these boobs⋯ So soft.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Eeek! You pervert![%p]
[name]A Voice[line]Hehe⋯ You never change, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Stop talking like you know.[%p]
[name]A Voice[line]I do know.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Get up, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki⋯and Mio?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ I guess I hit you a little too hard.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you going to do, Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This. Now be quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You two should stop fighting and make up.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, you're still half asleep! Don't you get the situation here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What situation?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is standing in front of us⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you think that is in her hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In her hand?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like a gun, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's real.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What? Mitsuki has a gun.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're finally awake. Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell is going on?)[%p]
