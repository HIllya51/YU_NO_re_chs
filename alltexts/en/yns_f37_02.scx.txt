Take the Stone
Don't take the Stone
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll do it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Attaboy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, it's supposed to be sturdy glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll break the glass⋯ You should stand back, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe⋯ Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Hypersense Stone][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Hypersense Stone][color index="800000"].
[name]Kaori[line]That seemed a little brash.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now, will you give that to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What? You've come this far. You don't need it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You've come this far⋯ What's wrong now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I take this stone⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]All right, fine. I'll do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm wrapping my hand in a handkerchief. Stand back a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, okay, but what's the handkerchief for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]For this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That was rather violent⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heh, I guess so. I didn't have a choice if I wanted to get the stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're just like a corporate spy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong? You look pale. So, your employer is someone from my school?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wh-What⋯are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The reason you wanted me to take the stone was to get my fingerprints on the case.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wh-What⋯ N-No, of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're stuttering.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I was the perpetrator and Ayumi orchestrated the whole thing, is that it? That's some clever thinking.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh?! D-Did⋯did he tell you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who, Toyotomi? No, I haven't talked to him.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then, there's no way you could know all this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You let it slip. You basically just told me it's what you're doing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Who⋯are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm a student at Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I⋯ I never thought you were this sharp. You're so sharp, it doesn't feel real.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying I'm making it up?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I won't deny your hypothesis, but nothing sounds more like a lie than a hypothesis without proof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a hypothesis. It's a fact.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's your evidence? If I'm suspected without definitive proof–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound just like Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Haha⋯you are sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you admit it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm, but you made one mistake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you wanted to get close to me, you should've kept the stone for yourself. That's called negotiation, kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]See ya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ W-Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't let Kaori escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After her![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ What's going on?![%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((There's an intruder in Section D12. Security, please respond directly to Section D12.))[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((I repeat, there is an intruder in Section D12.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, is this Section D12⋯?[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((Security, seal off the entrance immediately.))[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((I repeat. Security, seal off the entrance immediately.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a lot of noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this rate, I'll get caught in no time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the entrance is already sealed off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should I go?[%p]
