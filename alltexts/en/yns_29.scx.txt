[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there really no one here?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I shouldn't have left the half-wrecked car like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A couple was just looking at the car and talking. They'll call the cops soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds like it'd be bad if they called the cops.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It sure is unless we check it out now. If we don't do it, we'll miss our chance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Do it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you look so nervous?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing. But trespassing and also damaging property? You'll get quite the reputation.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not if I don't get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe this is a teacher talking.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The headmaster isn't home today. And his mother is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Swinging from the ceiling in the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Should be about ten minutes before anyone shows up. We have to move fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Maybe we should split up. I'll go to that storehouse first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't freeze up.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, I'll be careful. You go search somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I looking for?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Something out of the ordinary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out of the ordinary?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Anything is fine, no matter how trivial. Call me as soon as you find anything. Do you have a watch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, yeah. I have one.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then lets meet in fifteen minutes. Be back then, even if you don't find anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone. She always does whatever she wants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what am I looking for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something out of the ordinary⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there really no one here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Breaking in⋯and I might have to damage property as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This makes me a bad boy. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But who was that just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I was seeing things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the main house sure is quiet too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wasn't at the storehouse entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, she calls me out here, and now she's gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just making it brighter makes a huge difference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Mitsuki is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe in the main house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did I say too much at the end?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, it should be fine to ask a few leading questions.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There might be some kind of reaction later.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I should go.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I just heard something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boy⋯ Come here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is that coming from?[%p]
