[name]Woman's Voice[line]((See? It's not so scary, is it?))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((What a crybaby. He needs to man up.))[%p]
[name]Baby[line]((Waaaah!!))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Leave him alone, honey. You're scaring him.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Will you be all right? You're blind, after all⋯ Be careful.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((You're concerned about our child, aren't you?))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((I don't give a damn about this weakling. It's you that I'm concerned about.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((There you go again⋯))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Hmph, this is how you handle a wuss like him.))[%p]
*pinch*[%p]
[name]Baby[line]((Waaaaaahh!!))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Don't pinch his cheek like that! The poor thing⋯))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((A real man wouldn't scream like that just because of a little pinch.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((You're being ridiculous. He's just a little child⋯))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((I will allow no son of mine to cry like a wimp.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Again with that nonsense⋯))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((It's every man's dream to⋯))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Don't.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Fine.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((All I ask is that he grows up healthy.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((And toughens up.))[%p]

[name]Baby[line]((Waaaaahh!!))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Your scary face is only making things worse.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Hey, that kind of hurt.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((But I really do love that face of yours.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Hehe, you're blushing.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Hmph⋯ In any case, a man shouldn't be all over his own mother. It's pathetic.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Again with your nonsensical jealousy⋯))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((Those breasts belong solely to me.))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Sure, sweetie⋯ Now leave us alone, will you? You're going to make the baby cry again.))[%p]
[name]Male Voice[line]((All right, fine⋯ Become a strong man, you hear me?))[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]((Yes, yes⋯ Now off you go.))[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*yawn*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I slept like a baby.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky, white clouds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not too hot, not too cold⋯ What a perfect day for a nap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why it's always so nice up here on the school roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lying down on the concrete, looking up at the sky without a care in the world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh, nothing can be better than this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I have a dream like that, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even my dumbass father made an appearance. That was intense, as usual⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mother⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mother⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ I don't even remember what her face looks like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not like there's even one photo to remember her by⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man burned them all. Said he wanted to put the past behind him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must be getting pretty desperate if I'm even dreaming about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been pretty frequent lately, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean I've been having those dreams a lot, not how frequently I do “that”⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Who am I even talking to, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dreams are realizations of repressed impulses⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to some smart doctor⋯or so I've heard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]“Repressed impulses”, huh⋯ Or maybe it's stemming from the guilt I feel towards my parents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I ditch class, I'm always late, my grades aren't too good⋯ Yeah, a normal person probably couldn't manage this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In that sense, you could say that I'm extraordinary. Praise-worthy, even. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, this is getting pretty dumb. Moving on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing tying me down now⋯ I should think of it as a release, rather than repression.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Yeah, a release.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky, white clouds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really is a perfect day for a nap⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't help but nod off when the weather's this nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And when I start nodding off, I end up falling into a deep sleep⋯ I can't resist the laws of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the last class before summer break just ended.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's time I abide by natural law and start heading home.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]You mean abide by your worldly desires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, white panties.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Ditching class again, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why if it isn't our school physician, Ms. Eriko. Your panties are as lovely as ever.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Who cares about panties.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh? Do you usually go commando?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How did you come to that conclusion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just said you don't care about panties.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wasn't talking about whether I wear them or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you prefer to wear them like a hat?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Can't say I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me you sniff them?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you find sniffing panties entertaining?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it would be fun to sniff yours.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ Then⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Who's talking about panties in the first place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ That's no fun.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is it really too much to expect you to get up and talk like a normal person?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But just look at this beautifully clear blue sky⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not very convincing when you're staring directly at my skirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the word “picturesque” was invented for views like this.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You seem disappointed.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just thinking about how hopeless you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And yet you still don't even bother to cover up. I love the mature confidence you exude.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Anyways, I wanted to talk to you. What can I do to make you get up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯ It might help if you get rid of that piece of cloth that's in the way.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm not trying to help you get up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a sharp one.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The look on your face is scaring me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm considering stomping your face with the same boots I was just wearing in the restroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, so you were just in the restroom, huh? ⋯*grin*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, what are you imagining![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you know⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, fine⋯ Just stop giving me that demonic glare.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hurry up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up we go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't be surprised if you actually did kick me. That's what makes you so scary.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You really are hopeless, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the rooftop of the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school physician, Ms. Eriko, is there. Let's talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the rooftop of the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ It's already been two months since that old bastard died⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko looks like she wants to say something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]“Well” what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You wanted to talk to me, right? I'll hear you out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're as pompous as ever, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just who I am. I don't think that's ever going to change.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hah⋯ No wonder they assigned me to teach one of your classes, despite being the school's physician.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It appears those rumors about your previous teachers quitting weren't just rumors after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I bullied them. They just quit on their own.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've heard that one of them left after you got into a physical altercation with him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't know anything about that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh well, that's not what I came here to talk about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seems like you've been under quite a bit of stress.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe you could help me relieve some of that stress, if you catch my drift.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not what I'm talking about, asshole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hah⋯ It's nice to see you haven't changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't be so sure about that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone always gives me special treatment here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Even the teachers?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Them too.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can hardly blame them. They say your father was both a renowned scholar and a close friend of the school president.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People are just making a fuss over nothing. I've never even spoken to the school president before.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Your father must've known him well, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm not my father.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not how the world sees it. *puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry about the smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. My old man turned the curtains yellow in just a week from all the smoking.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is that so? It's reassuring to know there are still people like him⋯ I've been feeling self-conscious about being a smoker these days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ That's not like you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I resent that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But didn't you start smoking only recently?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, right after I started working here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it hasn't even been two months. How are you such a heavy smoker already?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm addicted⋯*puff*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were they strict about these things where you came from?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Somewhat. It's just how things are in that country, I suppose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were living somewhere in Europe⋯right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm? Oh⋯ Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There were all sorts of rumors about you before your inauguration. Everyone was excited about the beautiful and talented woman returning from overseas.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do I get the feeling you're about to contradict those rumors?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, here you are, talking tough and puffing away in front of a student⋯completely shattering a boy's fantasy.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This is who I am⋯ I'm not gonna put on a show.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heheh⋯ But you know, I like you the way you are.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah⋯ You and I may be quite alike.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This teacher is really easy to get along with.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see you're still playing the lone wolf, sleeping up here all by yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really⋯ It's just that my classmates have been avoiding me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I heard you quit your club?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I got bored of it. That sport is never going to get popular.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Kendo, was it? Literally means the “way of the sword”.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ It's so old-fashioned.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I like it, to be honest. It's a part of traditional Japanese culture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's all about soccer and baseball. The World Cup and MLB are all everyone and their mothers talk about.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I heard you were good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At soccer?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, at kendo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was nothing special. It's been a hobby of mine for a long while.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They say you could have achieved higher ranks if you wanted to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man used to train me when I was young. He was a real traditional kind of guy.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, was that what you wanted to talk about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a part of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't like you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like you to show such consideration for my feelings, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You used past tense earlier, when you said my father “was” a close friend of the school president.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯You're quite observant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is why you wanted to talk, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah. It's part of my duties as your homeroom teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's very unfortunate⋯ I'm sorry I can't offer much more than that, but it truly is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please, I don't want your pity.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just take it as social etiquette, nothing more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't seem to be too sad about it, as far as I could tell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not. That old bastard just went off and died on his own.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It happened about two months ago⋯while he was conducting research, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, he got buried alive during a rockslide. There's no way he could have survived that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was finally declared dead after a whole month. Took a lot of weight off of my shoulders.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph⋯ If they actually found his body, I would have at least been able to give him a piece of my mind, but⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see⋯ That was unfortunate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's not get all gloomy now. I'm over it, really.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He was a prestigious historian⋯or so I've heard. Forgive me, but I don't know the details too well since I just started working here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if he was all that prestigious, but⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He basically existed solely to think of the past–always nose deep in historical books and documents.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Dr. Koudai Arima⋯right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. He always made me listen as he went on and on with his historical knowledge.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's a good thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was just something for him to talk about while drinking. But I suppose my grades in history class were pretty decent thanks to him.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]By the way, I bumped into Mrs. Arima downstairs earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Arima⋯? You mean me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't be stupid. Why would I address you as “Mrs. Arima”?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you mean⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You met Ayumi? I didn't know she was here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seems she's here to talk to the school president about expanding the scope of the construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mrs. Arima seemed quite cheerful. I was pretty relieved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I hope she's not just putting up a front.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There are times when I don't know how I should speak to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just talk to her like you normally would. She's not the type to have a breakdown in public.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It must be tough for her, losing her husband only six months after getting married⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How are things at home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's going fine.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's not what your face is telling me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Has it been difficult to talk to her about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course. How would you feel in her shoes?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to say this just in case, but please don't⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Of course I'm not going to mention anything to her. I wouldn't dare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, thanks.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I mean, there was a case when a teacher was dumb enough to talk about it too directly and got punched by an aggressive student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? I don't condone violence, personally.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They say it was your past homeroom teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had no idea. That must have been a pretty stupid teacher, though.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, what are you going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go home and play with myself, probably.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You really are something else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure all the guys my age do it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, idiot. I'm talking about how confident you are. Your mentality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I make sure to do it at least twice a week.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Masturbation, of course.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, you should be fine if you can still say things like that. Use some of that vigor to cheer up your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Have you decided on your career path yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you asking out of curiosity?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hardly. Everyone should be free to live their life as they please. That's also my own personal philosophy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm asking because it's one of my duties as your teacher. The vice principal asked me to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do plan to graduate, at least.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah⋯ Well your family doesn't seem to have any financial issues, so you should be fine on that end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because Ayumi actually has a respectable job, unlike my old man.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's some big corporation by the coastline if I recall. Geo⋯something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, you're supposed to be the teacher here⋯ It's Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right, that's the name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I can't really see it from here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a nice view, though⋯ I can see them doing it on the shore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're doing it on the shore?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Are you stupid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sob*⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They've been doing a lot of construction lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ They've been constantly working on it for a week now.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll go to the coast and check it out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Apparently, they've prohibited entry there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to take a peek from the side.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They're examining the bedrock of the area so they can expand the facilities, or so I've heard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, they are?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you asking me? Your stepmom's the one that works at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We don't really talk about her work at home.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I suppose there's no need to talk about work when spending time with family.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I heard⋯it hasn't been going so well lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey now, are you going to start prying into my family affairs too?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm talking about the construction, stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It appears that there have been recurring accidents on site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems so.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wonder why that is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'd probably learn more about that by reading the newspaper than by asking me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I did read about it. Three people have already died from being struck by lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mrs. Arima should still be somewhere in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And? I'll see her at night when she gets home anyway.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, getting an attitude, are we? Nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tch, there's just no beating her.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh yeah, did you hear about the scholarship?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope, this is my first time hearing about it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The school president offered to take care of the rest of your tuition if you ever run into financial troubles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can tell him that I decline his offer, with all due respect.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all I have to say about that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You seem to have some issues with the school president.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're entitled to think what you'd like, but don't talk about as if it were the truth.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was close with my father, not me. I have no duty or obligation to be on friendly terms with him.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, I have to go soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry for not being a teacher you can depend on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should be sorry.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hah⋯ But you can always come to me if you ever need consultation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to be so considerate of my feelings, you know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]As long as it doesn't involve money, I'll try to help. Just come see me at the infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll help me with anything other than money?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hehehehe.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Denied.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't said anything yet.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can imagine the kind of thing you would ask for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're going to judge me based on personal prejudice, despite being a teacher?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You've got a mouth, don't you? Fine, tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My sexual frustrations.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Denied.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, sexual frustration can be a very grave issue for wholesome young men.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're anything but wholesome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh. Well, supplementary classes will be starting tomorrow. Don't ditch them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who knows what tomorrow will bring?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're hopeless⋯just make sure to head straight home, all right? Knowing you, you probably won't listen anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, you get it. Nice job, Teach.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I should get going⋯ I still have some work to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you tired?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I suppose so. I've been requesting to work night duty lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Night duty? As in keeping watch at night?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Something like that⋯ See you later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh, she sure is one weird physician.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wears a tight-fitting miniskirt, always has a cigarette in her mouth, and has that bothersome hairstyle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Yeah, the sight of her would definitely crush every young man's fantasy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm on the school rooftop⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd say it's about three stories high. The school itself isn't very tall.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's because this school was designated as an environmental preservation area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Supposedly, tall buildings obstruct the fine natural scenery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I guess I'll have to show off my artistic side now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at me, I'm the Mannekin Pis![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Are you stupid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sob*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you do it too, Ms. Eriko? You could be the Jeanneke Pis.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ms. Eriko Takeda, the school physician.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's supposed to be stationed in the infirmary most of the time, but I hardly ever see her in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I wonder why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've had my hands full with work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought your job is to be in the infirmary?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I guess you could say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's up with this teacher?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks really good in that skin-tight outfit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A teacher probably shouldn't be wearing something like that, but that's what makes it so great.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I heard this is the type of clothing that's popular these days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who would say such an awesome⋯ I mean, irresponsible thing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That would be you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Oh yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is trying to say something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should talk to her some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough* *cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But boy, it's pretty refreshing to see a teacher puffing away on cigarettes at school like this.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can't help it. It's not often that I get to smoke these.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are those high-end cigarettes or something?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, I meant that it's illegal to smoke in some places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right, Ms. Eriko just got back from a foreign country.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if she wasn't allowed to smoke where she came from?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you want one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on, are you offering cigs to one of your students?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh right⋯ Guess I should worry about my student's health⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I worry about her sometimes⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But you know, there aren't any penalties for smoking, legally speaking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I mean, in a legal sense, there'd be no ramifications if you started smoking right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ So if I was to smoke one, no one would be able to punish me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, you would be violating school regulations, so you could be punished with everything from suspension to expulsion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not smoking. I hate it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Though I still like you, Ms. Eriko. Almost as much as I like sex.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That doesn't make me feel better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sob*⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her long hair is tied back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She used to wear it down until recently⋯ I wonder why the change?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was warned by my superior. Said that I should look more professional, since I'm a teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ I'm not surprised.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hair is flowing in the ocean breeze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She has such nice hair⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, see you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you leaning over the railing? Feeling suicidal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Oh right, we're on the third floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, see you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you hopping up and down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I thought I could fly into the sky⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, see you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's the inside of my skirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would explain the fragrant scent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, see you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hold on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I'm actually trying to use the stairs this time.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's still something I need to talk to you about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, see you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But you're just standing there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm all out of jokes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is it really so hard to stay still for one minute?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, fine⋯ I guess I'll hear you out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should listen to what Ms. Eriko has to say.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You should be a bit more subtle if you're going to stare at a woman's breasts. And stop reaching towards them like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear it's a natural instinct for men to be drawn to a woman's ample breasts and ass.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's because of these instincts that the human race has prospered to this point.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's awfully convincing coming from someone that's driven only by their base desires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that supposed to mean⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Cut it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, I suppose I won't look at them then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, so nice and shapely⋯ Heehee⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sound like a perverted old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a nice-looking ass⋯ I'd love to grab two handfuls right now.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You just did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooops, my bad.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Try that again and you'll be eating my boot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll keep that in mind⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't wanna get kicked, so I should probably leave her alone⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's kind of annoying when you lay it out like that.[%p]
