[name]Eriko[line]What's got you down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You want to talk about something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I guess asking Ayumi in person would be faster.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm, all right. I'm off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're leaving already?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You could say that. I can't leave the infirmary empty for too long. My smoke break's over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't just leave the school, did you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Leave the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, after Ryuuzouji went into the school the back way.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, that. I was on a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Abandoning your post⋯ You really are an incredible teacher.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Nobody said I was perfect. I just like to go on walks sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay, I'm going down to the infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi was chatting with Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was Ayumi feeling?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's not my place to ask how she's feeling. What do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I want to know if she's just tired, or if Ryuuzouji did something to her.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't really know what you're saying, but I think she's been fine all along. She was even chatting with the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi was chatting with Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know what that means.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to ask you something, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh. You didn't sidestep my question like you usually do.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I could tell from the look in your eyes that it was serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, what is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to know if you saw my stepmother, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ayumi? Now that you say it, yeah, I think I saw her in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So she's in the school.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, I think she was with the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji? Do you know what she was talking to him about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Probably something about expanding the construction. I don't know that much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji and Ayumi were together?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does that mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that face she's making at me right now?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You seem to observe people sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A cigarette in her mouth, letting her hair cover her face. She doesn't look like a school physician to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But for some reason she doesn't look sloppy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her tits are big⋯it gets me excited.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have some big tits.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I better be the only one you do this with.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯(Those are nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know, you shouldn't stare at a woman's breasts so obviously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say that, but I love how you're not even angry.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's because I know getting angry with you won't do any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What was that sound just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯probably the sound of my libido.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her skirt is really short. It's actually a bit⋯exciting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, is it really okay for a teacher to wear such revealing clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me happy, of course.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was your suggestion that there were endless benefits to wearing these kinds of clothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, you were correct in assuming that these clothes would get me through problems when dealing with my fellow teachers. Smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why else would I wear a white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you weren't wearing these, you probably would have been mistaken for someone racy.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you mean, racy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll explain later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think Ms. Eriko isn't quite used to Japanese standards.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can barely see her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her physician's coat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if she were playing with herself through her pockets?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You seem to be having some dirty thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet there's a ton of cigarettes in them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
