[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is waiting for me. I should return home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time for basking in nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of trees, fields all around, and a desert that lies beyond all of that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It may still be appropriate to call this a beautiful view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This might be the last time I'll see this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The forest. A green treasure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place with such vibrant trees is a treasure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This will be my last look at this forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond there lies the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was called the Rafaelo Desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can just get through the desert, I'll be in the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see our house all the way back there, to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the right. That small house is ours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me and Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alright, let's go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are we going back to the forest?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We don't have time to be doing that.[%p]
