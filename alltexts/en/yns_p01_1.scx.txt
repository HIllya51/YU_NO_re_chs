[name]Takuya[line]My room. That Monet painting sure is bleak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I should go to sleep in my bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm so sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't seem to fall asleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit. This happens all the time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm really sleepy, but I get to thinking and can't fall asleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sleepy, yet restless.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's exactly how I am.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I could do that, I'd be a professional comedian.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's always acting so cheerful around me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kind, merciful, caring. She's the poster woman for what a mother should be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was only half a year, but I caused her a lot of trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She even came with me to apologize to the principal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She also protected me from some of those crazy teachers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She never scolded me, ever. Wait, there was that one time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, it was that day I came home from that crazy fight. It was when I helped Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was so stern and sad as she spoke to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]“Don't ever do that again.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could I not listen when she looked at me like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When my dad went missing after the accident, and then when they confirmed his death⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She never lost her composure. At least not in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯she never cried in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But maybe she did when I wasn't around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know that I have to get my act together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get my act together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That crazy bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought he couldn't be killed, then he went and died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was well known along with Ryuuzouji in the field of historical science.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yet he was never home, only made bank transfers to support us, and when he did come home he'd get drunk and pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now he goes and dies on us. Bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you ask me, being a father was nothing but an inconvenient hobby for him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch. Even if he did come home, I wouldn't forgive him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd punch him right in the face. I can't wait till he comes back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That stupid bastard is still my father, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'd get all happy just to see him come home every once in a blue moon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her eyes would glimmer. She never once smiled like that at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that means there was a good side to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Ayumi love him after all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, what a dumb question. Of course she did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she didn't, why would she stick around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that he's dead, I wonder what's going to happen to us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where do we go from here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about our future?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought this way of living would last forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My everyday life, Ayumi's everyday life⋯my old man, my friends⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never thought things would change so much from one piece of the puzzle going missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our everyday life hasn't changed much looking from the outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that bastard is never coming home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things will never go back to how they were.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's Ayumi going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's still in her 20's. It's not like she's going to stay a widow for the rest of her life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staying single after that bastard died on her⋯what a ridiculous idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not cool at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi has a right to happiness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, god dammit. Why am I getting so ticked off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't my problem. It's hers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What can I do right now, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I can just try to act like not much has changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Act like an idiot, make her worry a little⋯ Same as always. That's all I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Filling in for my old man, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Agh! Stop it! Just stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This kind of thinking is a dead end. No use in thinking about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where there's a will, there's a way. That's what the old man always used to say. Yeah, I'm sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to sleep, tomorrow will come, and things will go back to normal for us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where there's a will, there's a way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm starting⋯to get sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I have remedial classes tomorrow, but I don't want Ayumi to be any more worried than she already is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've thought as much as I can. Now it's time to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi cleans once or twice a week, so my room is nice and neat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't think I'm bad at organizing or cleaning. I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Order becomes chaos. It's a law of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My disorderly room is just a reflection of the way the universe is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I even talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means Ayumi is going against the laws of the universe once or twice a week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I told her that, she'd just say she's following the rules of the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must have cleaned this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff⋯sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It kind of smells like Ayumi's perfume.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at my bed makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's about time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It squeaks a lot when you get down to business, which is a huge downside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And by get down to business I mean tossing and turning in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get sleepy just looking at it, so I won't look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to sleep yet, so I shouldn't look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bay window on the left hand side is basically a storage space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can probably get down from the window on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi will get mad at me if I do that though. Because it's dangerous, she'll say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Men can be so stupid sometimes. I shouldn't. I'll end up just like my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a window. I won't open it because bugs will get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to some books, this painting is by someone called Monet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not an original, of course. Well, it's good enough to give the room some taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what the subject of this painting is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put it out with the garbage on trash day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like watching TV. I should stay here.[%p]
