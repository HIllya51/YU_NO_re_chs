[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sounds of nature have returned to the coastline after so long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone? Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's that coming from Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But no one was at Triangle Mountain.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, what happened to Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why are you asking about that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I went to the school today, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, so you saw the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm looking for Mio right now. Did you see her, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Where?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mio is headed somewhere she should not go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somewhere she should not go?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please stop her. Before something bad happens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something bad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She took off. That girl's like the wind, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio is headed somewhere she shouldn't go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no construction now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quieter than I thought. Even though there was that accident yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no construction now. It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it doesn't seem like anything's out of the ordinary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the lightning struck over there somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, I can't hear the construction noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could they have gone on hiatus now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll know if I ask.[%p]
