[name]Takuya[line]It's always dim in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dim. I wonder if there's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like mold and dust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It probably hasn't been used for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like Mitsuki is around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯ Where are you, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Mitsuki's voice⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, Takuya, where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a window. The sky outside is blue for as far as the eye can see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light shining into the dim storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't really rely on it as a source of light though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked. I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a metal door. There seems to be another room beyond this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I knock, I doubt someone will come open it for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a metal door. It looks pretty sturdy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's a room on the other side of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure whatever is on the other side is in the same condition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pillar supporting the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a big, black pillar supporting the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's thick, and it seems to be supporting the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This old desk is all rickety.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like an antique, like it's here for decoration.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corners are all worn. This desk must be ancient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if this is just a storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa⋯ I shouldn't mess with it too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plenty of different things lying around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the word complicated describes it pretty well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many books⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why are they all in this storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they no longer needed for anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that means Ryuuzouji has read them all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is an incredible collection of books. It might even rival my old man's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They are both scholars, so it makes sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it is an old storehouse. It's no surprise something like this is in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this? A hoe?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hoe: A flat, metal farming tool used to plow farmland.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah, hah, hah! You should call me the walking dictionary![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I even talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, this does seem out of place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was this part painted over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plaster, unplaster⋯ Sounds pretty sticky to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be because there's plaster on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plaster is just a special type of paint used on ceilings and walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I explaining this to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This part is exceptionally white.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe if I use this, or⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm taking this rope.[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Rope][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Rope][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the rope was hanging⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not there anymore⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because I already have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This looks like a sturdy rope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could take it if I wanted, but I don't need it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt Mitsuki is inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My nose tingles just looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This much dust can't be good for me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It reeks of mold and dust in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyone with allergies would be sneezing up a storm right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, there's not much I can do by hanging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, there's not much I can do by hanging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll do that after we look around some more⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, there's still plenty of time left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Maybe I should look into this more?[%p]
