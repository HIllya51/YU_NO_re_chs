Hand it over
Don't hand it over
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. Thank you. That helps a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was this really the right choice?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now then, there's still something I want you to do for me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I'm not your fall guy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wow, you're sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]However, you should've used your sharpness to act sooner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]About time you showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Behind me⋯?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ My head.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ They hit me in the same spot⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it⋯ Toyotomi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should've been more careful⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel dizzy⋯)
[name]Voice[line]Look over there⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]He can't be far⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Have you searched this room?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]No, not yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's aching⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My head⋯hurts.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ Shit⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Next, check over there⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'll search this area⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I keep hearing voices⋯ Sounds like they're in a hurry⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, I was⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-My head hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why does it⋯ Oowww![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I've got a huge lump on my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I have a second little head growing. Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm⋯starting to remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I entered Geo Technics with Kaori⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then the moment I gave her the stone⋯ Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing? I should've thought before I acted.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Look over there⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]He couldn't have gotten far⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Did you search this room?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]No, not yet. However, this was the former head facilitator's office⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]There's no time to spare. The stone was stolen, so we need to search everywhere![%p]
[name]Voice[line]I never thought we'd have two break-ins two nights in a row⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Just keep searching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I fell right into their trap. Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do? The guards are about to barge in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to get out. Shit, I can't believe Kaori tricked me so easily⋯ She won't get away with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, how am I getting out of here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go into the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That door goes nowhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The window doesn't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way left⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I can't hand it to you⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm sorry, I don't think I heard you right. Can you say that again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I can't let you have it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why? You've come this far. It has nothing to do with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, it does. In fact, I think this stone is actually my lifeline.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm saying I can't give you the stone.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Can you at least tell me why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look so mad. You're not so pretty when you're angry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lump on my head. That's why.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Lump?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure you wouldn't understand if I told you, and I don't need you to anyway, but there's one thing I can say.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second I give you this stone, my role is over.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wh-What are you saying? O-Of course it's not. W-We're partners, aren't we?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're stuttering, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could smash this stone on the floor right now.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]D-Don't![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then tell me the truth. My head is still throbbing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what is this stone?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I told you. It reacts to human consciousness. That's all I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be ridiculous. That's impossible.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Of course you think it's impossible, but wouldn't it be all the more valuable if it was?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is your employer, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I-I don't have one. I'm just here purely out of the spirit of journalism.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those are strange words for a corporate spy to say.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong? You look pale. So, your employer is someone from my school?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wh-What⋯are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The reason you wanted me to take the stone was to get my fingerprints on the case.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wh-What⋯ N-No, of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I was the perpetrator and Ayumi orchestrated the whole thing, is that it? That's some clever thinking.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh?! D-Did⋯did he tell you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who, Toyotomi? No, I haven't talked to him.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then, there's no way you could know all this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You let it slip. You basically just told me it's what you're doing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Who⋯are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm a student.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I⋯ I never thought you were this sharp. You're so sharp, it doesn't feel real.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying I'm making it up?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I won't deny your hypothesis, but nothing sounds more like a lie than a hypothesis without proof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a hypothesis. It's a fact.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's your evidence? If I'm suspected without definitive proof–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound just like Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk to me. Tell me who you work for. Why do you want this stone?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine. This stone appears to be the only example of its crystallized form. It would be a shame if it broke.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]W-Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then talk. Why do you and your employer want this stone?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. I have no attachment to this stone anyway.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Stop! A-All right![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]However, I have conditions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you think you're in a position to give conditions?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't like one-sided offers. Let's negotiate at least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ You're strong-willed.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll give you the information. In exchange, you give me the stone. It's a great deal. What do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll think about it. So, about the stone?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I⋯don't have any details, sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's true. I really don't know. However, I'll tell you what I do know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm listening⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]My employer wants to try using the stone as an energy source.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Use a stone that reacts to human consciousness as energy?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what I hear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what do they want to do with that energy?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't know. For this job, I didn't need to know about my employer's end goal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That person said that the Hypersense Stone might be some kind of living mineral.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A living mineral? That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]They'll discover life on Mars at some point. It wouldn't be strange for there to be a silicon-based life form.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our ancestors were born from a sea of amino acids. So you're saying their ancestors were born from a sea of molten metal?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You can believe what you want. I'm just telling you what I've heard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Come on, that's enough. Give it to me.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Dammit! I've stayed here too long.[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((There's an intruder in Section D12. Security, please respond directly to Section D12.))[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((I repeat, there is an intruder in Section D12.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, is this Section D12⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Over here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess you couldn't talk yourself out of this one. You expected this to happen after you had already left, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't have time to talk now. I'll make you give it to me later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Kaori?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait! I still want to ask you something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, I can't be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to get outside![%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((Security, seal off the entrance immediately.))[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((I repeat. Security, seal off the entrance immediately.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a lot of noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this rate, I'll get caught in no time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the entrance is already sealed off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should I go?[%p]
