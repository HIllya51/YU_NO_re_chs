[name]Kanna[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A girl, fresh out of the shower.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is pretty nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's late so I'll just⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear some kind of bell ringing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Excuse me for a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, this is Hatano speaking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A cellular phone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't have a landline, but she owns a cell phone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's kinda weird.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]About earlier⋯ Yes⋯ Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Earlier?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it that bastard?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, nothing of that sort. Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what they're talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna really never smiles, does she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And they say everyone drops their guard when they're on the phone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's always so calm, doing things her own way⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](With whoever she talks to⋯whatever they talk about⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, I was just thinking.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it that guy from earlier?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What guy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy Houjou or whatever.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this guy to Kanna?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd be going too far if I asked that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sure she has her reasons for doing what she does. It doesn't concern me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just leave it at that for today.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can always ask her about my old man tomorrow.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Would you like to stay the night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Stay the night?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a bold thing to say.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Only if you want to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to judge this situation?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stay the night?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shouldn't it be obvious what she means by that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When a girl living by herself offers you to stay the night, there's only one answer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯weird.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is everything all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just thinking it was strange.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Do you mean I'm strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get a mysterious feeling when I look at you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I think that's just your imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm Koudai Arima's son.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. So you know my old man, too?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I may.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's vague.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's better that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you just tell me one thing?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is my old man alive somewhere?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, he is alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks. That's all I need to know. I'll stay tonight.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That old bastard is still alive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No doubt about it.)
((Takuya.))[%p]
((Takuya!))[%p]
((Hey, wake up Takuya!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((How long does this kid plan on sleeping?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Shut up, old man.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Who says I'm old?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((They say the first sign of aging is loss of self awareness.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hmph. Your new mother is coming today, and what are you doing?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I told you I don't need a new mom.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Still saying that, are you?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'll say it forever. I won't accept it.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Let me ask why, then.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Because she's not my mother.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Mmhmm.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Stop acting gross.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((That's not the only reason you won't accept her, is it? Masochist Rex ring a bell?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'm not a masochist.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Oh, right. It was Oedipus Rex.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I don't have an Oedipus complex!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You won't accept it because it's Ayumi who's gonna be your new mother, right?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Wh-What are you talking about?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ayumi is young and beautiful. She's quite close in age to you, and she's kind. Mmm, she's a nice woman.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Heh, getting excited over a woman 8 years older than you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((And you're the one marrying a girl 20 years younger than you. And she was your student!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((It's love. In the eyes of love, age doesn't mean a thing.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((*gag* I'm going back to bed.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Oh yeah. I thought I should talk to you about this.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I don't want to hear stories about your newfound love.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((No, it's about your real mother.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Oh, nice and quiet now. You're like one of Pavlov's dogs.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Out with it already.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I figured we'd never talk about this again, so I have to say it now.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Your mother is dead. That's a fact written in the stone of history.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((However, facts don't always tell the truth.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's that supposed to mean?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Remember, Takuya. History is not a record of transitions in the past.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What are you talking about?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Your mother is⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Wait, what?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Your mother⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's with that banging?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Because⋯she's⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I can't hear you, old man.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Come on, say something.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hey, I can't hear you!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?! You said all that, then you're not going to tell me?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You dumbass!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was that noise?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hear banging. It must be her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It must be my grandma pounding on my shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I'm always thinking the same thing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You idiot. I don't even have a grandma.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She died a long time ago.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So what's that sound?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sniff⋯sniff*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something smells good.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It smells so homely.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's sizzling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which makes me think of splattering, which makes me think of blood.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, what am I going on about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This feels so comfortable.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm already sleeping, but it's making me sleepier.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels like my mothers warmth.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Warmth?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm, what happened to your family?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I asking her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm getting nervous for no reason.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have no family. I live alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? Living alone at such a young age? That's pretty impressive.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, time to go for it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're getting an allowance though, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]An allowance?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, you can't work full-time and go to school. You're living off of money your parents send you, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh, I see what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have no family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They died a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ I'm sorry to hear that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's in the past now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what about now?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm asking some really invasive questions right now, aren't I?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't have any right to ask things like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's so fun about poking at Kanna's painful past?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But now that I've seen my old man's name, I can't back down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now ask her!)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Do you want to ask me something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm, how are you feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I asking her?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. I think the medicine you gave me is working.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. I'm glad to hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hahaha⋯oh well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not like this is the last time I'll ever see her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll have more chances to ask her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The hot water is still on. I'll go turn it off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that a clever way to avoid me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whenever I try to bring something up, something else always gets in the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it's because she's sensing something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if she saw me before?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But how should I ask her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I mention my old man's name, she'll know I looked at the bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She could get me in trouble for burglary, I bet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmmmmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry to keep you waiting. What were you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, can I ask you something?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I'm really going to ask this time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](About my old man, the bankbook, and Houjou.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you⋯feeling better?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry I came in without permission and walked into your bathroom like that. There is no excuse for my behavior.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's fine. I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So she doesn't see me as a man.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There's no need to worry about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I brought this just in case. It's fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You went out of your way for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it should help. My mom was using this, I guess.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now, to ask about my old man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And why Kanna has his bankbook.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why money was being deposited.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why she doesn't have any family.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And what that old alchy is to her.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry to keep you waiting. This medicine is easy to take.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, right? It's supposed to work well.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now ask. Ask, I said!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she thinking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell from her facial expressions at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should try talking to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can smell her shampoo.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It makes her seem more girly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the headband she always wears.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna's.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her arms are so pale.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her arms are so pale and beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And with the length of her sleeves, it's kind of sexy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't have much covering her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A tight shirt and short overalls.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is right in front of me.)[%p]
