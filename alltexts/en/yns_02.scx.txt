[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No time to be lazing around like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm looking for Mitsuki. Why am I loafing around in the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room. Ayumi should be in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Clear to the right, clear to the left.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't seem like anyone is around right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should go upstairs as quietly as possible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Better make sure I don't do something stupid like slip and fall, or else⋯)[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, gah!!! Never mind⋯ I fell.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ahh! Pervert![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Pervert! You're a pervert, aren't you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, calm down. It's just me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me? How am I supposed to know who 「me」 is?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, she doesn't have her glasses on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is really nearsighted.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, h-hi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Didn't you just go upstairs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I⋯uh⋯there was some dirt on my shoes. It's been bothering me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just go back upstairs now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is suspicious of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to stop this now.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you just come from the foyer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was just⋯you know, polishing my shoes. They say that having a neat appearance keeps your mind clear.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, so serious. Oh, the bath water is nice and hot so go have a soak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯ Sure.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, wait a second. Where are you going? Your room is upstairs, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not⋯going out or anything.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Really.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sorry, I had to lie.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Fine. Then get ready for a bath and get in quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
*pit, pat, pit, pat*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like I'll be able to leave through the front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go upstairs.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you get whatever it was you forgot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Uh⋯ I can't remember what I needed.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What ever am I going to do with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way I can go through the living room.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you remember to bring a bath towel?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Um⋯ I guess I forgot.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What⋯did you forget?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ Haha! Stupid me! I forgot what it was I needed. I'll go and⋯try to remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way I can go through the living room.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you bring socks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I forgot a towel.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's a bath towel in the linen closet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, um⋯ I can't sleep with anything but my own pillow. And I refuse to dry off after a shower with anything but my own towel.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mhmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I'll go get them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way I can go through the living room.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, did you bring underwear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I forgot socks.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But you always walk around dripping wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I'll go get them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way I can go through the living room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to Ryuuzouji's mansion again and⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, you finally came down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The bath is ready for you. Go ahead and get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't tell me you're going out at this hour?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Of course not. Why would I?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's what I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should go back to my room.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm gonna go get some underwear. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room. Ayumi is doing chores in the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, just a second. I didn't get the bath water ready yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, sure.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew⋯ It's so nice to finally get all this housework done.[%p]
*pit, pat, pit, pat*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in the kitchen again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! It feels like I'm finally home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know this is my house, but it doesn't feel like it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, what are you, some kind of aspiring philosopher?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hold on. I'm going to go change. We'll eat in a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Weren't you going to be out late?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I was, but the video recording went faster than usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Video recording?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew⋯ I'm sweating so much. I'd kill for a bath right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, video recording?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you recording something on our TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi is going to be late again tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, what to do?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I have to head out to the office again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You got a call from work?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, I'm so sorry. And we were right in the middle of a conversation. Dr. Ryuuzouji took all of the documents from the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you gave all of them away?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, it was a joint research project, after all. It's only natural that he takes the documents, now that Koudai can't continue with the research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew⋯ That was hard work. There was so much dust everywhere. I'm really glad I cleaned though.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew! Losing the key to the study made it really hard to get the door open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key to the study?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. The key actually broke. I'll have to call the locksmith to come fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We'll discuss it more later, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay? You don't look too good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I think I have a little fever. So much happened all at the same time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's not good. You should be resting.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm fine. I took the medicine like you suggested.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stuff my old man's last wife was using?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. The fever medicine your mother used. It works very well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ Just don't overdo it, take care of yourself.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You too, Takuya. You can't skip class, but at least make sure you get rest when you need it. Don't work too hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's my line.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was definitely Ayumi. She couldn't be anyone else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might not be the same woman I know. That's possible, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, thinking about all the possibilities is tiring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She gave the documents in the study to Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like anyone is home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi said she was doing an inspection. What am I doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you home?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. She hasn't come home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's study. I wonder why it's like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might find out more if I ask Ayumi about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I need to look for her first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came down to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, are you here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not home yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me Ryuuzouji has⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is my only option⋯going to the police?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that gun. Things were looking pretty dangerous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In that situation, if he said he was holding a toy lighter, I'd have loved him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the only thing I can do is go to the police.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Didn't he say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯he said⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((The cops might come after me.))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((Ayumi will be in trouble if the cops get involved. Actually, it might be better to say she'd be in dire straits.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi will be in dire straits? What kind of trouble would she be in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Ayumi was also looking at him, as if she'd noticed something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It couldn't be exchanged for her life though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's gun. If that weren't a toy, things could be pretty bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell am I supposed to do now?[%p]
