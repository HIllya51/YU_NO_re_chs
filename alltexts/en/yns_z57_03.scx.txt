[name]Takuya[line]What a quiet night in the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is asleep. Maybe I should try talking to Sala some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Practicing submission moves⋯ What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]And your daughter's fast asleep, too⋯ Hmm-hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well⋯ What do I do?)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Now then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ You scooted a little closer to me.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Your daughter is sound asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Can't you tell when a nubile young lady is in the mood, out here in the middle of nowhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only the 「middle of nowhere」 part was true.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You're mean![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My daughter is right over there, see?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Why are you talking like a preacher?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am a man of integrity.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]One who beats people up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's different.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]With your daughter sleeping so close by⋯ Doesn't it excite you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]It's okay. If she wakes up, we'll just say we were wrestling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Shhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This woman does whatever she wants⋯ Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Actually, there's a resistance in the capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A resistance?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Yup. People who disagree with the government and society gather together and hold protests.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So they're protestors?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]They say the God-Monarch should be removed, and the government should give the power to the people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia mentioned the same thing before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said her sister was involved with that kind of movement.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]The one who influences them is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me ask something: do you have an older sister named Illia?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I'm an only child. Always have been.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ Sorry, continue.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]If you ever go to the Imperial Capital to beat up the God-Monarch and get in trouble⋯ And I'm sure you'll get in trouble⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]If you beat up the God-Monarch and somehow manage to survive, look for a woman called Amanda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Yes. I can't say I've led the best life, but she was always good to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I have to warn you that they're not a very big operation. She's like a big sister to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I have no plans to join some conspiracy for a revolution. I just⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You just want to beat up the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* You're funny. I think Amanda would like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Amanda, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what she's like⋯)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* You're pretty wild.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, wild?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I love people with a fire inside of them. You're nothing like all the lazy men in the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, why are you crawling over here?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Tell me: what's your goal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I should ask. Don't crawl so close to me![%p]
[name]Sala[line]I just wonder what you'll do in the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do anything. I just have a little business with the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]God-Monarch⋯ Business? What business?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to beat him up, that's all.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*chuckle* Ahhahaha! That's good![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Ookaay, so that means you have a disagreement with someone in the Imperial Capital. Someone with power, no less.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can imagine whatever you want, but don't blame me if your imagination is miles from the truth.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hmm⋯ Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Well⋯ I wonder if I should tell you this. I'll tell you, just this once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey now, you shouldn't say it if it's important. I can't be held responsible for what happens.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I have a feeling it will be all right to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it about the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Yes, or something that has to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It has to do with the Imperial Capital⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This may be some useful information.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hey, what's up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Getting all thoughtful out of nowhere. You're weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I just got over my apathy. Can I ask you a question?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What would that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me about the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, uhm⋯ What kind of people live there, or what are the hot topics right now?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Imperial Capital, there must be a ton of people, right?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]More than this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obviously.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]All I can say is that all kinds of people live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure that's true, but give me an example.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]For example, there were people like me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were? Past tense?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I was planning on leaving the Imperial Capital. There's a village nearby, I'm going there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I ask why?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]It's hard to live in the city anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city⋯ You mean the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Yes. Everywhere is filled with the dread of eschatology.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eschatology?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]To put it simply, the idea that the world is going to end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're talking about the wrath of mother nature that pulls Dela Grante into chaos every few hundred years, right?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Ooh? The country boy knows his stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Nobody knows where to find the priestess who performs the ritual⋯and there's no one to take her place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]So that's why the idea that the world's gonna end is spreading.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The end of the world⋯ What does the end mean?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I don't know. Maybe the wrath of mother nature will strike us dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have there been a lot of earthquakes recently at the capital?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]That's just a glimpse of what's to come, or so they say. According to the people in power at the Imperial Capital, everything is going to be destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrmph. That gives them no right to harm innocent people.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They will get what they deserve sooner or later.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hmm⋯ Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing. Just common sense.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Even if it's inside the territories of the Imperial Capital, they just arbitrarily decided the capital's borders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I can't say for sure where the actual land of the Imperial Capital ends, but I know this place isn't called Rafaelo anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]It's inside the capital's borders, but it's still a sacred place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sacred?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]It might be because the temple is so close by, but the guards always arrest people who walk around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temple is nearby⋯ Hmm.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temple⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Either way, it means we made it through the desert now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And to think for a minute there I was ready to die⋯ Hahaha.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You really made it all the way across the desert, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I said.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You looked so relieved just now. Hmm. Can I ask you something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What kind of place is the Border? Is it much different from the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know anything about the Imperial Capital, so I can't say.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's pretty normal, though. There's grass and trees, the desert, mountains, a huge cliff, and nice fruit.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Sounds like a strange place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What makes you say that?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]All that stuff in one place? It doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You lived there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that she mentions it, she's right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It does seem like a bunch of stuff was mish-mashed together.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was also that monster.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come to think of it, I guess it's a little strange. No, it's very strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But even if it does seem strange, isn't that just because it goes against what I know?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything about Dela Grante goes against my common sense.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So, what would make it strange?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ This is a very time-consuming observation.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You looked so scary. You had the face of a murderer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? That's just the way I look.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hrmph⋯ Oh well. I'll blame it on you coming from the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I care if you don't believe me.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]But isn't the Border under the jurisdiction of the God-Monarch? Do you work for the government or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]But you came from the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hmm. Seems complicated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's more complicated than you'll ever know.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I can't believe you actually crossed the Rafaelo, though. They say it's the biggest desert in Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, I'm still in the middle of crossing it. This is the Rafaelo, right?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]It's hard to tell where it ends, but this isn't the Rafaelo anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It isn't?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Nope. We're in the territories of the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're already inside the Imperial Capital?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way⋯ You mentioned the Imperial Capital earlier.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that means the Imperial Capital is close?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Before I tell you that, I want to know more about you. You're not from the Imperial Capital, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]So, where are you from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Very far away.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Like where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond the desert.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Well, that's where the Border ends! You don't have a horse or anything, you couldn't have crossed the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I walked.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]See? I knew you were lying. No one can walk that far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only place that's too far to reach is the sun.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]That's totally impossible. And also stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's possible to cross the desert if you walk non-stop for a week under the glaring sun and over hot sand that nearly kills you.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I brought two weeks worth of food and water, but that was gone in no time. I think you'd probably need three weeks' worth.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]And that young lady came with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I can't believe it. I've never heard of anyone crossing the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't need you to believe me. But there's one thing I can say about it⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hatred only gives people more strength.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. There's only one reason I came to the Imperial Capital.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm going to make those who took Celes from me regret they were ever born.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Come on. What are you looking at? Eyes. Up. Here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* (Geez.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]It's fine. No one is around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope not.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You seem to care an awful lot about everything around you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* I knew you were different from the others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't get the wrong idea. I'm just a normal guy.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]A normal guy who carries a sword and is constantly wary of his surroundings?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not being wary. I'm just worried about hanging around at night near a fire.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]See? That isn't normal at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I don't know where you come from, but this is a nice place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it is nice. For lizards and plants, I guess.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]There aren't any animals around here. Just plants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it seems almost too quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's vegetation, a lake⋯ Are there really no animals living around here?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Animals only live in certain places in Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can hear is the crackling sound of the fire.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Night in the desert is so quiet⋯ Very quiet.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Yes⋯ All eyes on me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You're very careful, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]But I like that about you. It's so wild.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* What?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Being cautious? It's all right, I won't steal your clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She actually seems somewhat normal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But stealing clothes from a Royal Guard? She's not someone I should be messing around with⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to be on top of my game, too.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You don't have to check so often. She's sound asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hrm⋯)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You said she was your daughter, but⋯ Is she really, you know, yours?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What? You don't have to glare at me like that just for asking.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* She's sleeping like a baby.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]She must have been so tired.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]After she ate all that food, she fell right asleep. She'll become a sloth at this rate.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Just so you know, I'm going to charge you for the food.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I've always wanted to try doing it outside, at least once. *giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯ What am I going to do?)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Don't worry. No one is going to come out to this desert.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You're such a worrywart.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]If you don't warm up, you'll freeze out here.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]The desert gets so cold at night.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Wait, wait⋯ You're going to go cool your head?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Do you know how embarrassing this is for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a poor attempt at making me feel guilty. I never asked her to do anything!)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Are you serious? I'm not going to stop you.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What, sitting down again? You're so weird.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]The way you do things is so confusing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come to think of it, there's no pillow or anything out here in the desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmf, mmf, mmggg⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop. Sala will get the wrong idea.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I knew that's what you were up to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-It's not what you think.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Are you some kind of pervert?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No![%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* Finally in the mood?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Oh, I remember⋯ You're married, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯not anymore.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Did you break up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're really nosy, you know that?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]That's what makes me so charming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck is charming about that?![%p]
[name]Sala[line]You've been lonely, haven't you? It's okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]All right, fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now what?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hehehe, not very confident, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I know all about guys like you. They say they're tough, but it's just a cover up because they're so insecure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're annoying me.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Oh yeah? I'm right here, prove me wrong![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know you're trying to get to me, but it won't work.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Ooh, are you losing your confidence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, fine! We'll do it. God, you're so annoying![%p]
[name]Sala[line]Finally in the mood?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrmph. You better not regret this. I haven't been this hot in a while.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Ohh, think you can satisfy me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll show you![%p]
[name]Sala[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Sala[line]Wh-Wha⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How's this?![%p]
[name]Sala[line]So the pervert shows his true colors! You're ripe and ready, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't pretend like you're unimpressed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever⋯ I'll admit you have a gorgeous body.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]D-Don't even start. Hehe, I bet you say the same thing to your wife.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would that make you jealous?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the first person I've ever said that to, Sala.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Y-Yeah right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know, I know⋯ I'm a filthy liar.)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your breasts look incredible.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]H-Hey⋯ What are you saying?![%p]
Her entire body doesn't have a single scar or wrinkle on it.[%p]
The shadows from the fire make her look even more beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're crying.[%p]
Even as I tell her, I wipe her tears away.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Mmn⋯ Why are you so nice?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who knows?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hey, what you said just before? Did you really mean it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm? Yeah, you have beautiful skin. You are absolutely alluring.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I've never had a guy say that about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've just never found a good guy. You look so cute and lovely⋯when you're nice and calm.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
It's finally nice and quiet. Makes things easier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't actually have as much experience as you say, do you?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Wh-What? What do you care? That doesn't mean⋯ Ah![%p]
Sala is so sexy in the light of the bonfire that I am naturally drawn to her. There's an intense flame burning deep in her eyes.[%p]
Every time I blink, her figure turns from a seductive enchantress to a pure young lady and back again.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? There's no reason for you to call me Dad.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]That wasn't me.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](D-Did she see us?!)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is, uhh⋯ You know. It's one of those adult, uh, things⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]You could be a little more specific.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sh-Sh-Shut up! You need to help me out here![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]D-Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, this is, well you see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She saw us⋯ It's all over!)[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Your face looks like it's seen the end of the world![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, it is the end of the world! My daughter just caught us![%p]
[name]Sala[line]Yu-No, your father is a very good sex-ed teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't say stuff like that![%p]
[name]Sala[line]What's the big deal? I'm just trying to back you up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll just get the wrong idea![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ After you finish eating, you have to bring your dishes back to the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Man⋯ You're really lost without me, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, is she sleep talking?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Pfft⋯ Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯ I'm going to bed![%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* Oh come on over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Heeeeeeey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* What do you want?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Do you really have to go to the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I have my reasons.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I see. Then I'll say no more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sala, what are you going to do?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I'm going to do what I planned on from the start. Go to a nearby village.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I'm sure we'll never see each other again. *smirk* It was fun while it lasted. I've never been tied up like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hehe, I bet it felt good.[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Of course it didn't![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]Just be careful of one thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Sala[line]I hear the God-Monarch is a cold-hearted bastard. Even if he begs, don't let him get away with what he's done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]*smirk* That's what Amanda always used to say. But they say lots of people died there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Sala[line]So⋯ Just be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, got it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A cold-hearted bastard, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know that better than anyone. I won't forgive them until they've paid for what they did to Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll never forgive them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Time for bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We'll avoid travelling in daylight and wait for nightfall to head out tomorrow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Imperial Capital is close.)
