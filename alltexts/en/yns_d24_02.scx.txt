[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is a woman who says what she thinks without holding back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But something that was stuck in my heart feels looser now.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe. I'm glad I got to talk to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I think I feel a little better, too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I have to go now. Ryuuzouji is waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The doctor?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji, yes. Hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hand?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know, noticing what a woman wants in this situation is how you get popular with the ladies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not trying to be popular⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Quit your grumbling. Come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah⋯ Your Highness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, there's a crack in your armor, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing all the sudden, geez.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I hope we see each other again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Thanks for talking to me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're welcome.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Didn't you have something you wanted to talk to me about, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was something I was thinking about Ryuuzouji, but after I talked to you, it doesn't seem to matter anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]All right, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hey. Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to ask you something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You already know my measurements.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, what is it, then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard there was some kind of painting hanging in Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A painting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I think it's called a tapestry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, the tapestry Mio went to see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that's the one. What's it like?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's a tough question. Well, it's like a religious painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A religious painting? What's going on in it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's hard to explain. There's something that looks like a church, and what looks to be people suffering next to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. That's pretty common. Is there something unique about it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Something unique, hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. What kind of picture is it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, there are beams of light above the church-like building⋯and there are flames surrounding the people⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's kind of hard to picture in my head.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why don't you ask him to show it to you when you have a chance?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll do that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]See you around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ The worries of youth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That reminds me, I heard some gossip, or maybe a rumor that interested me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A rumor?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Looks like there will be an investigation into that company soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I overheard that, too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know, the mayor's been accused of collusion and corruption⋯ According to Mio, it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And with the recent accidents on top of that⋯ It looks like these investigations will start all at once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the police will step in?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, I'm sure the company will just blame someone and say they've fulfilled their social and moral obligations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who will they blame?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know⋯ I'm sure they'll just find a scapegoat, like when a politician blames his secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Your stepmother works at that company, doesn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She does.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An investigation, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're gonna blame someone⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if someone who doesn't like Mio happened to pass by, they would've wondered what was going on at the coastline at night.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And while they were listening to us talk, they would've heard that monologue.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they didn't like Mio, it wouldn't be strange for them to use that information against her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So now the problem is, who did it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Someone who doesn't like Mio, someone who would benefit from her leaving the school, and someone involved with the school⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It sounds like you're talking about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I mean, she was my rival for your affections.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Like last night at the school infirmary. It made me a little upset to hear the two of you talk so excitedly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're kidding, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Am I? If I had been there at the coastline, maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop kidding around. You wouldn't do something like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]They say love is blind. Even though we usually act normal, when our heart is set, laying down our lives doesn't seem strange at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If it was me, what would you do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't do anything.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Because I know it wasn't you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But that doesn't answer my question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll ask.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Go for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it really you that did it, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're right. I'm sorry, that was a stupid hypothesis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's what I thought.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You and I already broke up, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But I hope we can still be good friends.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope so, too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But there is a theory that friendship between a man and a woman can't last.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's prejudiced.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I hope so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But, it's strange. The things written on the bulletin board, as you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The only people who know that are you and Mio, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I believe so.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Was there anybody around then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Around?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. I mean, that's the only possibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see. I didn't think to check if anyone was around us.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if someone was listening⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But still, the question is why did someone do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Even if someone just happened to hear us, I can't believe they'd go out of their way to post it on the school bulletin board⋯ Wait, the school?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's it. The fact that it was the school bulletin board is a clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone involved with the school.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Possibly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the only possibility I can think of. I mean, why would you go out of your way to use the school bulletin board?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What did that person gain by using the school's bulletin board?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gain? Maybe they want to frame Mio.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Framing Mio, huh. It's true, she is good-looking, with good grades. She's the model student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Making her the perfect target for jealousy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, let's say that's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So, someone who happened to not like Mio just happened to be at the coastline, and just happened to overhear you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a lot of happens⋯ I wonder if that's possible.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, they say fact is stranger than fiction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that really true?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It feels like so long ago. Do you remember one month ago?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-This is sudden⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I remember. I remember everything we did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯ I remember, too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Really.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So tell me what you ate one month ago today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meat and potato stew, and some spinach.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You little liar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's your evidence?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it. You already forgot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Whoa![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't you remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I think I might remember.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, that's when she showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was crazy. Mio was holding back tears⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her earring is gleaming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You wear earrings, right Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you don't really like dangly ones, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, I'm glad you remembered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a serene smile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's perfectly messy, but not sloppy in style.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A pretty bob cut.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a little mussed by the ocean breeze right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's some dangerous cleavage.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look so soft.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯the blue sky.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're not making any sense, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Bad boy. You shouldn't look there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* You really are straight-forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Pale and translucent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such beautiful skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such beautiful skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki isn't that cheap.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe. I really like how straight-forward you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to take that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such delicate hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's pressing on her knees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be a love bite there she doesn't want me to see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No, of course there isn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's gotta be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those bare legs are mesmerizing⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those are the legs of a real woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see the ocean in the distance.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're doing construction there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although, it seems the construction is on hold now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they're still doing construction on the shore.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is a pretty rough time for that company now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rough?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You know about those construction accidents, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In any case, I'd say that's a really nice skirt.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're the only one who would say it that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You must be really confident in your legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If not, you wouldn't show them off so much.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, you say it like I want people to look at them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No I don't. It's just a simple matter of fashion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Really?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a skirt. And it's dangerously short.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That may be true, but you shouldn't stare so blatantly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's what they call a blouse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This actually is a place we could stretch out.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So? It's a nice place, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Good job finding it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't think many people come here, and you can relax.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is smiling, but I think she might be pretty tired.)[%p]
