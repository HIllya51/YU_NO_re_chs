[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯is the God-Monarch⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's listen to the story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if I truly understood, but I think I got most of what you said.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Surprised⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's been nonstop surprises since last night. At this point, I feel like I'm ready for anything.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Nonstop since last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ So, what happens now?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You mean the future of Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That and the future in general.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I've already told you all the necessary things. I'll leave the rest up to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up to me⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Everything is up to you both.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me ask you a question. What happens to the priestess who performs the ritual after she synchronizes with Grantia?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's too chaotic for me to tell what will happen to the priestess. My best guess is that both her body and spirit will disappear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There are some priestesses who returned to our world, like your mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But this time, the dimensional approach's energy is larger and more powerful than ever before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For reference, how much?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It requires an estimated 10,000 times more energy than it did 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If so, the example from 400 years ago is useless to us.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But there is no way to evaluate it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever you do, Dela Grante will fall into our world.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But if we don't change anything, a dimensional collision will occur and the two worlds will be annihilated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like having to choose between electrocution or suffocation.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If Yu-No performs the ritual, at least our world will be saved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, is Yu-No's sacrifice her destiny?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know most of what happened the last time around, but I do know Dela Grante crashed into Earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we had to choose between both worlds being destroyed in the collision or both worlds surviving, I think everyone would say one choice is better than the other.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In any case, Dela Grante is destined to perish.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We don't know yet. Even though that's what happened before, it might not be the case tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If Yu-No can maneuver Dela Grante well enough⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that wishful thinking?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All we can do at this point is pray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I say to Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I told her everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]She understood and agreed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a lie![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She agreed to it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To be the priestess⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Talk to her tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Tomorrow's the deadline. Tonight's the last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tomorrow⋯? That's way too soon.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I too wish we had more time, but there's nothing we can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she's right⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come in⋯ It's open.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Do you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Sit here⋯ Hey, not on my lap![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what's that pillow?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I can only sleep with my own pillow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, sit.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm sitting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not on my lap. Next to me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ooh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have something that you haven't told me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are way too easy to read.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No, I'm not! I don't have anything else to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lies aren't going to help you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But my breasts are way bigger and better than Mom's. That's got to count for something, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So? You got anything to tell me?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I love you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't hear you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I couldn't tell you⋯ I know if I did, you'd try to stop me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I would![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But, but, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No buts![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You look angry Dad⋯ I'm scared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am mad.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ooh, if you look like that⋯ Hehe.[%p]
*poke poke*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't poke my cheek.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I won't stop until you smile.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*muffled*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hahaha, you're funny, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't put your finger in my mouth. Geez![%p]
*nudge*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay. It's because⋯ The way the God-Monarch's story goes, if I don't do it, you'll die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Every human being dies someday.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's not that kind of death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen. I'm angry because you kept this a secret from me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, you have so, so, so many things you aren't telling me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]For example?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]A long time ago, you would snack right behind Mom's back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I am saying, Mom spent a long time making those dishes, but you gobbled them up in a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what we're talking about![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you scared?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Scared?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯ If you perform the ritual, your life might be exposed to⋯danger.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, if I don't do anything, I'm exposed to danger too, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's true, but⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Listen⋯[%p]
*touch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, if you want me to stop, I'll quit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not about me. Yu-No, it's about what you think. That's what's important.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What I think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure you're okay with this? Really?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's something I can do for you, Dad⋯ And I'm happy about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you scared?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'd be lying if I said I'm not scared⋯ But if we stay like this, nothing is gonna change, so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're all grown up.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I know, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure about this?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me honestly. Just say it to me. Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes. Because⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Because I need to⋯ I really need to![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No doesn't know what to do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what can I do for her?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]When the ritual is done, what's gonna happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody knows.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Do I die?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are priestesses that didn't die. But this time, it seems like the scale is off the charts compared to past cases.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Can I ask you for a favor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll do anything for you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not lying. I'll listen to anything you say.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Please⋯hold me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I want to be with you⋯until the end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I want you to hold me tight⋯ I want to feel your warmth.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]And I want you to feel me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]And I want you to remember me, forever and ever and ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I will never forget you.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never⋯ever forget you.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Please⋯ If you do this, then I think I can do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are conditions.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if you're a moment away from death, wait for me⋯until the end.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll come help you. Wherever you are.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you promise that you'll wait for me?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes⋯ I'll be waiting for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I love you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I know.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Can you⋯kiss me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh⋯ Please⋯ Don't let go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ Yu-No. I'm right here. Together forever.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's sleep talking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ She's finally gone to bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Finally, it's tomorrow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody knows what's gonna happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. If my mother was the priestess, why was she in Sakaimachi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This was Koudai's prediction; he wrote it in his notebook.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dela Grante will descend into the world we are in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Descend⋯as in it's going to crash into our world?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. But it's not a dimensional collision. It's a physical collision.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you know? Do you believe in prophecy?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't believe it ether⋯but Koudai made a bold hypothesis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The world we were in⋯ Sakaimachi, was the place where Dela Grante fell long ago, according to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]With this hypothesis, everything can be explained.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The secret of Sword Cape, the Hypersense Stone buried underground, and also⋯your mother.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Everything makes sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that's odd. The fall of Dela Grante would rock Japan's history.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, over the course of recorded human history, no such record is left.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It fell before recorded human history.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's ridiculous. How could my mother possibly be older than recorded history?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. Your mother came from another dimension called Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but it's confusing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai's theory goes like this. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, a dimension floating continent, Dela Grante, was born.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Up until now, Dela Grante has come close to us, but it's always avoided us.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your mother, the priestess, came over to our world when we approached it 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, not only then, but I imagine 800 years ago, or even 1200 years ago, various people arrived to our world when we came close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]However, this time Dela Grante and our world are approaching their closest encounter ever⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The Grand Monarch declared it was impossible to avoid this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, they'll crash into each other?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, dimensional collisions can be averted.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]However, due to the surplus energy of collision avoidance flowing backward, Dela Grante will be transported to the Earth 8,000 years ago. That is when the physical collision would occur.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dela Grante once descended to the Earth 8,000 years ago without reason. Many perished.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, during the next encounter⋯ No, during this encounter, Dela Grante will fall into Earth as it was 8,000 years ago.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. History always repeats itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Dela Grante's history is a loop.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That cycle comes approximately once every 8,000 years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see⋯ This is what it was all about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](History repeats over and over⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A pre-ordained event from hundreds of thousands of years ago, since Dela Grante was born?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This continent that repeatedly passes by our world on a 400 year cycle⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'll be the end of it with the next encounter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dela Grante fell into Japan 8,000 years ago⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait. If we do nothing, our world will be in an event collision with Dela Grante.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](However, history says that Dela Grante is located on Earth and only creates a physical collision.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means the event collision is prevented for some reason.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But how can it avoid an event collision?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What I've told you is mostly quoted from Koudai's own writing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to the old bastard?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He is not in this world⋯ He wrote that he will enter the wave flowing through all events.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do we do⋯ What should we do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you came over here at that time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well⋯ When Ryuuzouji pointed a gun to you, I was honestly surprised.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He was not the person that I knew. He was not even human.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is what Ms. Eriko was talking about.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]In the past few years, our world had come closer to Dela Grante. Due to a number of factors, a contact point between the two worlds was born.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that's how you got blasted into this world.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There was a hypothesis regarding the 400 year cycle in Koudai's research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]During the 400 year cycle, many people of Dela Grante came over to our world when it approached theirs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, just like we were sent over here, people here could go to our world?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Celestials of ancient Japan might have been the people of Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Some may have had outstanding talents, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that's where the hypothesis comes in. There are people who have knowledge beyond human understanding. Of course, that's why something would occur during that era.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But they had their weakness, too. It was the downside of going over to our world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dela Grante is not just a continent. Its composition is made of energy ore called the Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Energy ore?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Grantia's consciousness controls that energy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, does my Reflector use that as an energy source too?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's the priestess' sacred treasure. It is made from energy ore, a synchronizing item used together with a coffin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, they use this to synchronize the consciousness of the priestess with Grantia during the ritual. And that prevents the collision.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]When their physical structure was remodeled, the life force of their species became stronger.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But this energy ore was the source to support them. In other words, they cannot live without the ore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then, they can't get out of Dela Grante at all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's why your mother didn't step outside of our city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mother? What does this have to do with⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your mother was the priestess of Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you just say?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your mother was the priestess of Dela Grante⋯400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My mother⋯ The priestess?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can that be?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Everything in Dela Grante is managed and operated by the integrated computer, the Grand Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me, the God-Monarch is actually⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The integrated computer, the Grand Monarch itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The integrated computer carries out the scientist Grantia's instructions and distributes those instructions to others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, as time passed, people's memory faded away.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right. The original purpose was to prevent Dela Grante and our world from colliding. That is still the purpose.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The scientists surrounding Grantia at the time taught this information to their children.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But their memory faded with time. The purpose became viewed as sacred, and the procedures remained among the people as rituals.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The instruction from the computer was interpreted as the word of God. Everyone spared the trouble of trying to know the true meaning of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But, if we don't proceed with the rituals mentioned by the people of Dela Grante, this world will disappear along with our own.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯ That's why you oppressed the people?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I assumed the role of God-Monarch, so I could ease oppression from the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did you end up becoming the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I learned how to get accurate information from the Grand Monarch. It wasn't long before they praised me as the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry about what happened to Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you know what happened.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We've never met, but I've always wanted to meet her. I was planning to ask her to make the decision.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She ran away before that⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. The Royal Guard was not careful enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why Celes?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Grantia set up an inspection program that determines the attributes necessary for a person to be chosen every 400 years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And Celes was the match?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But after that⋯ Yes, four years later, the Royal Guard who came to capture Celes killed her.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It was unfortunate⋯ That was a very unfortunate event.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to that, as long as Celes' body existed, it should have been easy to synchronize with Grantia. They didn't need to kill her.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That leads to the sanctification of the purpose and the ritualization of the procedure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]For better or worse, the people of this world are very honest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hell with them! What they did was⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Listen. The scientific knowledge Dela Grante originally possessed has disappeared over the course of time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Only the existence of the goddess Dela Grantia and the belief that their god would save them calmed the people of this land.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All that goes against the sanctified purpose is evil, at least to them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An obfuscation of responsibility. Don't tell me something a politician would say.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ I know. I take all responsibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Since I've identified myself as the God-Monarch, I must make amends for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanted you to meet⋯ Celes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I wanted to meet your wife.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Was she good to you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Couldn't have asked for a better partner.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. So, you've been happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There is no way I can do something to Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dela Grante flew to different dimensions, and the abilities of the different dimensions were added to the people.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That alone was an accomplishment, but there were still obstacles for Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Control and management of Dela Grante itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It could fly to different dimensions and live in them. But, who is managing and operating all this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It seems that a certain case was the trigger.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A few errors started to occur in Dela Grante's trajectory calculations. They were discovered by Grantia herself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Errors?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dela Grante was supposed to orbit around our dimension in a certain way. But gradually they both started to get closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then⋯what happened?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Collisions were mostly prevented by the intelligence of Grantia and the labor of the group of scientists who supported her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But more shocking facts came to light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't scare me⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This dimension floating continent periodically approaches our world as if it would collide, and when that's avoided it drifts apart again⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯like a pendulum swinging back and forth. That pattern became clear.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Scientists possessed knowledge far beyond that of humans, but they were not perfect.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]As long as it is an organism, it cannot escape death.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Some people will die from sickness, others die from senility.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This is the only destiny that no one can avoid.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Only Grantia, a scientist leader, could control this gigantic dimension floating continent.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]However, she also could not escape time. She still aged.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Grantia made rigorous calculations and figured out the cycle when the crisis situation hits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once every 400 years⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]She determined it was impossible by human force to control the huge continent, so she came up with a certain technology.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A technology in which her consciousness itself controls and manages the continent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Controlled with consciousness?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right. No need for any physical input devices. Not even indirect input such as sound and visuals.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All that's needed was her own consciousness.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ultimate user interface.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But this had its own flaws.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]She needed a medium in order to project her consciousness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medium?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. In this case, a female human being who can synchronize with her spirit⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the priestess?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There are almost no records left of it. But Grantia's consciousness still protects Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To synchronize with Grantia's consciousness?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Because of that, we must stop the metabolic function of a body part. To increase the synchronization rate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Seriously⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I would have never guessed.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Where should I begin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's up to you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let's start with an old tale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Once upon a time, somewhere there was a group of people in an outstanding civilization.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It was still a time where those who were called human beings had not evolved completely, and were walking as apes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]In fact, they were rulers of the Earth⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let's say⋯we'll call them indigenous people of the Earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Indigenous people⋯of the Earth.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thousands, tens of thousands of years⋯ No, probably hundreds of thousands of years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hundreds of thousands of years⋯ I feel overwhelmed.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]In harmony with nature, this highly advanced civilization with their outstanding technological capabilities lived rich and fulfilling lives.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It was never a large-scale civilization, but it went as far as any single civilization could go.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But progress and decline coincided with each other. At the end of the development, there was only entropy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A crisis occurred in their civilization.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Crisis⋯ I wonder if God was angry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He could have been.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They say that the Tear of God came falling from the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Tear of God?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Scientists predicted that the Tears would destroy their civilization.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is the Tear of God?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know now⋯but there is a record that it might have been a huge meteorite group.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. There's also a theory that talks about Earth flying several times in the past.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They foresaw the destruction of the civilization due to the Tear of God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]In a sense, it may have been God's will.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A warning to the overly developed civilization.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But their super science had reached a place where even God's intentions could not reach them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were they saved?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They were in danger, but gathered their intelligence and science to create a certain technology.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If the Earth is in danger of extinction, it is only necessary to temporarily evacuate to a safe place away from Earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Outer space?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. The meteorite came flying from space⋯ They didn't take that kind of risk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then where did they head to? There's no place to go on Earth.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They thought about moving to a completely different dimension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They compiled a plan to bring the whole civilization to another dimension where meteorites did not fly around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Awesome⋯ Just like a migration.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ You can say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, so you used a dimensional moving device to move them one by one? The indigenous people, I mean.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's impossible. Even if you do it quickly, it's impossible to carry every single person by that device⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, only some of the people were saved?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No⋯ All of the people survived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They turned the land where they lived into an interdimensional transportation device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's ridiculous![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But they went through with it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It carries the continent itself to a different dimension. And so it was called the Dimension Floating Continent, Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The indigenous people foresaw that Earth would be the place they could live again.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They decided to float aimlessly through different dimensions, and all the while, they were determined to return to their homeland.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]At that time, a female scientist was the leader of the indigenous scientist's group. Her name was Grantia.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grantia?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. She was the one who designed Dela Grante, and took command of development, as well. That's where the name comes from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grantia⋯ Leader of the scientist group of a hyper-scientific civilization. An unbelievable woman.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But an enormous number of problems attacked the concept of floating the continent through different dimensions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure that would have happened. I mean, can anyone really live in such an environment?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ But we're still alive. At least until now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ In order to maintain Dela Grante, a huge amount of technology is used.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Deployment of oxygen supply systems with oxygen supplied by artificial carbon plants⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're artificial?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Of course they're alive⋯but they were first given life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]And another important thing needed for life to survive is⋯the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. The sun, too?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]An artificial sun that continues nuclear fusion semi-permanently⋯ That's Melgio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe this.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There seems to have been great care in trying to build such an environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]At first⋯when Dela Grante first traveled to different dimensions, it seemed to have been a disaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The population drastically declined to one-tenth of what it once was in the harsh environment. Many people simply grew weak and died.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It would still take a huge amount of time to improve the environment⋯but if they waited any longer, all lifeforms would've probably gone extinct.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The group of scientists I mentioned before, came up with the method of giving lifeforms the ability to adapt to the environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The improvement of lifeforms?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. All living beings here in Dela Grante were treated in order to maintain their activities⋯without exception.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The inhabitants of this world are different from us, aren't they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of which, so is their growth rate. Their appearance and behavior are exactly the same, but something is different.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. The scientists made many improvements based on trial and error. They are the result of those improvements.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The strongest species possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Their weak childhood period is short, and the adolescent period where they are strong and active is longer⋯ I see, that's why.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you told me there was trial and error.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So does that mean there are a lot of⋯things like⋯ It's hard to say, but I'm guessing there were a lot of failures, too?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, I am sure they exist. It is the knights' duty to protect the people of the Imperial Capital from those failed creations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean the creatures at the Border?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The Border of Dela Grante⋯ They were abandoned there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah⋯ Those monster-looking creatures⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Were they once human?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Holy cow⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I haven't seen you for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You really are Dela Grante's⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ It seems like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]My life is up to you, Takuya. But may I talk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ I'll listen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yes⋯ It's not too late, even after listening to what she has to say.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It shouldn't be⋯too late.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge room⋯ It seems to be the Queen's Suite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The carpet in here feels good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I lie down, I'm going to fall asleep.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ You still have a habit of falling asleep everywhere.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This room is called the Queen's Suite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The queen⋯ You've become quite a figure here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Not really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks a bit upset.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi⋯ Let's talk for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We may both have changed quite a bit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi seems to be much stronger than when I was living with her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's nothing. How long have you been here in this world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is definitely Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No doubt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is where Ayumi sleeps every night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bed.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's where I sleep every night. It's so fluffy and comfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sleepy, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She knows me well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I won't look, even though I'm tempted to.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But, the clothes in this world are quite revealing.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I feel relieved that you haven't changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ Same as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Same as always means I haven't changed and⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯wait, does that mean she's been looking at me this way since we were in the other world?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? You look sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I better look casually.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beautiful legs⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't stare too long. I should only do it for a little bit at a time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi has beautiful legs.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No one has said things like that to me in years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not yet⋯ We haven't finished talking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I still need to talk to Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Can't go outside now.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You should use that bed to sleep today.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can use that bed today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I will be⋯next to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ Surprised?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think my nose might start bleeding.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can stay over here today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am sure you have a lot to think about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No⋯ I can't do that now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not the time for that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how attractive Ayumi is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's so funny about hugging a pillow?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to Ayumi.)[%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! I see you still have that habit.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You always hug your pillow while you sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Do I?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't see myself when I sleep.)[%p]
