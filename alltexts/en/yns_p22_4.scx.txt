[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Ayumi?! Why are they here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me it was all a prank or something. I hope that's not what's happening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ What's going on here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give it to you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's wise of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do against someone with a gun. But tell me one thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man said he was somewhere.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's what he wrote.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does he mean it's a place I can find with this device?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is this device?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I already told you. It's a device that allows you to see the infinitely existing space-time possibilities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean my old man is alive somewhere in another world?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's not quite it. He's in the same place as us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you just⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]His spatial and material location is the same, yet not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit acting like a Zen monk.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No matter how I explain it to you, I'm afraid you won't understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess not.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Enough talk now. The device⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What? An earthquake?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Resonance⋯ No, that's not it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a big earthquake.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's not an earthquake. It couldn't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Was it something that woman did?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She didn't do anything⋯*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right, before this thing I have⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!!!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't even stand up.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]T-Triangle Mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's happening to the mountain?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If this continues⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi. I have to save Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The light⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's so bright. Takuya, where are you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯ There's a person on the rocks.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's her⋯ That girl. It's Kanna Hatano⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm losing consciousness.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old man⋯)
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now hand it over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you know that?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The answer is that device you're holding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Koudai Arima is alive somewhere. Yet that somewhere isn't necessarily in this time or space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then where is he?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's the same place we are in, yet not the same. He's somewhere in another world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That woman from before was a completely different factor. There are some things even I can't see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You knew that woman?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No. But I have an idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was she?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't need to say it. Now, give that to me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not a lighter, is it?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Bullets travel faster than sound.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]R-Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I just give it to you, you'll shoot me anyway.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I wouldn't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The cops might come after me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ayumi will be in trouble if the cops get involved. Actually, she'd be in dire straits.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that even mean?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does this mean, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He looks serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is starting to look bad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about my mother?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hm, so Koudai didn't tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does he mean my old man didn't tell me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said you could jump a span of fifty hours.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ So are you telling me this is a time machine?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're joking, right?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Even if you could jump fifty hours, there's more than one destination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It would be impossible to go to a completely different world from an energy standpoint. But a parallel world would be possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Your father was aware of the laws that govern this world. Once he seized a certain opportunity, that is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Opportunity?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Your mother.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What about Takuya's mother?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My mother was an opportunity?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, but first⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Our space and time is not the only one. Do you understand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could I?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There are multiple times and places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Multiple times and places?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! Clearly they don't teach you everything in school.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There are infinite possibilities for the same time and place. We know that much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are there really infinite possibilities?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The device entrusted to you is the key to the door of possibilities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key to possibilities.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're a little crazy then. Listen, I have no idea what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That device holds an enormous amount of power.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]A rough estimate would suggest it holds enough energy to jump a maximum of about fifty hours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ That's funny.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm actually hoping that you keep your wits about you now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not that crazy.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I wonder. What did he say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old man?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You can jump a span of fifty hours.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Infinite possibilities exist.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Time is a reversible concept. History is irreversible⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And then there's my father's letter.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's quiet. What is he thinking about?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That thing you have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean this mirror and this weird device?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]They may hold even greater meaning than we first imagined.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Those are your inheritance. I must have them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Ryuuzouji saying?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now hand them over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You've got to be kidding. I can't just give them to you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hm⋯ I'll give you a brief explanation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell is going on?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]R-Ryuuzouji⋯ Stop this![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like that bastard Ryuuzouji is serious.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ryuuzouji, what do you mean you can't find that person?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, he just said it. You can't mean Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What can I say?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A letter? What's going on, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well that's⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Koudai Arima may be alive somewhere.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He's alive⋯somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah. My old man is alive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't prove it, but I'm sure somehow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]H-He's alive? He isn't dead?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You won't find him if you search in our space and time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What do you mean, 「him」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. I don't know if I should tell her about the old man.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why are you here, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my line. You're here, Ayumi, so that means you found his letter?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]His?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't Ayumi know about my old man's letter?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, Ryuuzouji told me you would be here.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let me tell him, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He knew I'd be here. What the hell?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji and Ayumi are right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was just a naked woman lying here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She disappeared and then Ryuuzouji and Ayumi appeared.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. What the hell is going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like I have no choice.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Of course you're not my only goal. You should understand that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it was only me, maybe⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what if he points the gun at Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that how it is?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji has a gun.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He looks pretty serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe if I feint and dive at him, or⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, now, no funny business.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I should talk to him now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's got a pretty calm demeanor right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's he doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems Ayumi is the only one who doesn't fully understand the situation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is looking at me and Ryuuzouji, and she looks really worried.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she doesn't quite grasp the situation yet.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If you're going, then leave those two things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I can't go now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey! Where are you trying to go?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's try talking to Ryuuzouji for now.)[%p]
