[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see my whole town from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, I shouldn't have lost her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I just search the area?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Heights. You can see the whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see the park down on the left and Kanna's apartment building beyond that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Heights. You can see the whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see Kanna's apartment building in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm back, for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, Kanna's apartment building is the one I can see on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights. You can see all of Sakaimachi from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can we see your house from here, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. It's the apartment building you can see on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's the one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a relatively new apartment building.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. Nothing interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A utility pole. Having fun looking at it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I like looking at different things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, Kanna is a deeper thinker than I thought.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house is the perfect picture of a huge mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear her father is the mayor of this city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Politicians make a lot of money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Princess Shimazu's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I gave in to temptation and went there once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a super big mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get there from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a bird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the coastline over there too.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Over there is the next town. It's a beautiful place along the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, so you've been there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I've lived there before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fact is it feels good just looking at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The view from here is pretty good too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They say that gazing at the sky will clear your mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kidding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But looking at the sky won't clear away what I went through today.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I think that's how we become adults.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes Kanna says some very mature things.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way I could get to the ocean from here is to fly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little far from here.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The ocean is really nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]My mother said she liked to look at the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at it won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what the people living in this city are thinking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do they live their lives?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many houses. It's distracting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The distraction isn't a big deal, though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I live in the apartment building on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People live in each and every one of these houses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And every one of those people is living their own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like me to think like that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Well⋯ I think so, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This town never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no guarantee that will always be the case, especially for me now.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You say some very interesting things sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Oh, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi and those two yakuza were talking there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meiunji Park is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's full of passionate couples at night.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There are drunk yakuza over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's not like they're always there, but sometimes it seems like a bad neighborhood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The park⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's apartment building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should go to Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her apartment building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's apartment building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We parted ways at the park, but did she go home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back and forth, back and forth. What am I even doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was wasting time and forgot. She's suffering with a fever right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to bring her the anti-fever medicine I have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to Kanna's house![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I have to get her the anti-fever medicine quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She could be suffering while I'm doing this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? The apartment building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I have what I need yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I have Kanna's student handbook with me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her student I.D. is there too. I should get her I.D. card back to her as soon as I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the apartment building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the apartment building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really need to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an expensive-looking building. I wonder what kind of people live there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Just normal people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, r-right. Hahaha. You're funny.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna manages to say some pretty strange things with a straight face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try going downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That way leads downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this hour, it will still be bustling.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That way leads downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My body just moves on its own.[%p]
