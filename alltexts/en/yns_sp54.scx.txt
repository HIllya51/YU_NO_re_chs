[name]Takuya[line]I'm home![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know why I say that. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Celes go, I wonder?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she's smart, she'll be able to make it home. She's not a child, so she'll be fine on her own.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'll protect you until the day I depart.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'll protect you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Protect?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to protect Celes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. There's no way she's still in the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, what about that earthquake?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did something happen to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯she's still in the desert?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Answer me if you're there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celeeeessss! *cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit! This is not going to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way to find someone in such a huge desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's impossible. Completely impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Impossible?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My chances of finding her are zero as long as I stay put.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I try, the chances of finding her will be more than zero.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to find Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]CELEEEEESSS!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why am I here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look out the window. It's already night time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I've been searching for her this whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know! I know that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's nothing I can do![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I travel at an estimated two miles per hour and I've been walking for five hours⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I've walked 10 miles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On top of that, I don't even know what direction I've been walking in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'd been off by just 10 degrees, how big of a difference would that make in miles?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, it's like finding a needle in a haystack.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I⋯abandon her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came back again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can drink a lot of water over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no water here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes broke the wooden water tank.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, Celes isn't even here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought she would have been back by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Celes isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, whatever. I guess this is our goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not much for tears anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, it smells like someone's cooking.)[%p]
*pat pat pat*[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing? You seem like you're out of breath. Huh?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got bags under your eyes. It looks like you haven't slept at all.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you pulling me for? You want me to sit down?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something yellow in the dish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this corn soup?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it can't be. How could you get the ingredients for that around here?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want me to drink this?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
*slurp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*bleh* Ugh, what is this?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just mixed some yellow fruit into the soup you made last night.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you been making this all night?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*yawn* *munch* *smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]((Feeling better?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been hearing things since last night. Maybe I'm starting to lose it.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for the soup. It was⋯good, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Planning on coming with me again?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unfortunately, we won't be going to the forest anymore.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Rafaelo Desert. We'll cross the desert beyond the fields.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It supposedly takes a week to cross it by foot. If I combine the rations⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What? Ow, don't pinch me![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how much I search around here, I won't get to the bottom of this. I guess I'll have to go to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but this is where we part ways. Breakfast was delicious.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]((No!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep hearing things. I swear I'm going crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes is in the kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must be making food.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm home.[%p]
*pat pat pat*[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you so out of breath?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Food?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eat this and feel better?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I'm feeling really bad right now.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're lucky, not a worry in the world for you.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't follow me. You need to start⋯ H-Hey.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, no crying now. I am⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk, they say the only two things that can bring a man down are an empty stomach and a crying kid.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's what they say, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, at least they bring ME down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And they're hitting me at the same time.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, this isn't funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's fine. I'll do something about my empty stomach.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels like⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯my world is getting further and further away.)[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*grin*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, you just want me to eat, right?[%p]
Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*stare*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it's fine! I mean it tastes good, better than anything I can make, all right?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. I'm the one that needs some praise around here.)[%p]
