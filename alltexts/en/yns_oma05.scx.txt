[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Let's go to the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I found the Music Room right away. Tonight has been pretty successful already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I'm looking for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji points a gun at me, then Ayumi disappears⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Sorry if that seemed forced.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, something seems different about tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure exactly why I came here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I've never been able to visit this place at this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I able to do so now?[%p]
