[name]Kaori[line]Now, about that lock there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, don't give me that look. What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She unlocked the rear gate and slipped right by the security cameras.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then casually entered the passcode on the inner automatic lock to get inside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just who is this woman, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she really a newscaster?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you really a newscaster?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what you're thinking, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's not⋯ I mean, a little.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Good. It's good to be honest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, let me ask you this. Just who are you, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A human.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh come on, can't you even smile?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can you joke at a time like this?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A time like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are security devices everywhere. We're breaking the law right now.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Getting around security devices that don't work is easier than taking candy from a baby. Plus, it's not illegal if we don't get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got some guts.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's here, anyways?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Just open her office door first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You have the security card, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This woman⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wondering how I knew?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You came all the way in here this afternoon, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So, it's only reasonable to think you have a security card. More reasonable than thinking you're some kind of master locksmith.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is so hard to deal with.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm much more interested in how you disabled these security devices.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That has nothing to do with me now. Do you want to get to know me, or save your mommy dearest?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's right. It doesn't matter who she really is right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything will be fine as long as I can prove Ayumi's innocence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And if I can get by without fumbling around for a way to do it? Even better.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Alrighty⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's right. Just like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something still doesn't sit right with me though.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Get the stick out of your butt already. Let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That stings my heart, but I guess now isn't the time to be complaining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like we're breaking in here with evil intentions. We'll figure out what to do when we get caught, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if we go up here, then straight down there, we should reach Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, here we are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's room is on the left⋯ I want to talk to her so badly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know how to open it, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the second time I've been here. It's pretty quiet for an office building, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't see a single employee on my way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They must have everything automated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand the merits of doing that, but anyone can come and mess things up as long as they can slip through security.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, I'm pretty sure Ayumi's office was through the door on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
