[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji limped away⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had so much more to ask him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no time for that, now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go save Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The garden is supposed to be at the top of those stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that means this is underneath the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view above is⋯amazing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's four or five floors in this colonnade.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main hall is pretty big. The circular room must be dozens of feet across.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like this is the castle's dungeon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not big⋯ It's huge. There's nothing near it to give it perspective. It only seems small from far away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where Ryuuzouji was imprisoned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, why do they need a place like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't they have normal prisons here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a strange floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're like flagstones, but different somehow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These flat stones are all lined up perfectly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are stairs over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should get moving instead of looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are stairs far off in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those steps should take me to the castle garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And Yu-No should be just beyond there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. So I just need to go up those stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get to the garden from the castle courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be a trap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What Ryuuzouji said makes sense, and he's got no reason to lead me into a trap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If he wanted me dead, he could just alert the 20 or 30 guards nearby and be done with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go save Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is just past here.[%p]
