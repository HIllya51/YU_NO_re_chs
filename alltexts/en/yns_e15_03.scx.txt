[name]Takuya[line]That sound⋯ Where did it come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, it came from over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard a voice, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it were that old bastard, I wouldn't let him get away with it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd slam him in the face two or three times, tie him up, and make him talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that bastard were here⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No doubt about it, someone's there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Have they been watching me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I couldn't imagine anyone doing that but the old bastard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, old man! I'm opening this up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ka-Kannaaa?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]So it was you, Arima. You startled me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were in the shower! I'm so sorry![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I mean⋯ You know⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you drop something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No. I'm really hungry⋯ I mean![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm even more embarrassed that Kanna isn't!)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I was sweating a bit, so I decided to take a shower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Right⋯ That's good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I saying?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Are you going to take a shower as well?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, I⋯ I mean if it's together with⋯never mind! Forget it![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]We can do that if you'd like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Maybe some other time.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! No, never mind. I'm uh, just feeling a little sad.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sad⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just when I thought it was my old man, it turned out to be Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if there's one thing I'd never want to see it's his naked body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'm kind of lucky it was Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Looks like she was here the whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to frighten her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she doesn't really see me as a man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would be a little sad.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A girl, fresh out of the shower.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is pretty nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that sound coming from the fluorescent light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wouldn't be coming from outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound came from inside the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air conditioner isn't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone in the medicine box?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they could fit in here, they'd be some kind of spirit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the table but the medicine box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's inside the garbage can?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would be funny if someone were inside this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unfortunately, no one is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would someone be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Try being a little more serious with this search.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if they're hiding inside the empty cans?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're not after some man-eating amoeba.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside the fridge?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside the fridge?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just one cup on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's for storing things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound came from inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there![%p]
