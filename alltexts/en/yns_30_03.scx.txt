[name]Takuya[line]Uh, yeah⋯ I can stand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to stand up and lose the view.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were staring at the sky like you were thinking of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, look at how clear the sky is.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What? You've changed, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Your old prickliness is gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I've achieved enlightenment before reaching old age.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then I have something to ask the young scholar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go ahead.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you think of me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, why are you looking away?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at how clear the sky is.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yes.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, you know I like you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's a perfunctory way to say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, my Juliet⋯ahem, 「It is the east, and Juliet is the sun⋯」 Is that what you want me to say to you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're ruining your looks scrunching up your eyebrows like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then answer me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You looked away again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But look at how clear the sky is⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You've been avoiding me since last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No I haven't.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I hate you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I hate you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you apologizing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I should.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So you apologize to people for no reason? That's like bowing in the dirt whenever an old man walks by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of statement is that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I really hate you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just get up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ahhhhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You did that on purpose![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't, I didn't.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]H-Hurry⋯ Hey⋯ Agh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I know, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is just what they call force majeure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I always say shit like this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You didn't really believe me, did you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You only believe half of what I said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a mean way to put it. You could say that I believed half of it as a positive thing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Say it however you want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was hoping we would find something more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like the journal itself or something?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, that's why I was looking in the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mr. Ryuuzouji was especially strange today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange? Was he out dancing in his underwear or something?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That was you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be serious. He really was acting strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange how?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He was really nervous. Even the phone ringing annoyed him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, so it's that time of the month, huh? Whoa! I'm listening, I swear.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He told me to clear his schedule for the day and when I told him he couldn't miss the conference in the afternoon⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He started saying strange things like he had to rearrange the furniture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rearrange the furniture?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. Then he said some terrible words to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did he say?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ms. Ichijou, you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, you don't have to say it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no need to make Mitsuki say it again and upset her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm insensitive, so I don't notice those things. I'm such an idiot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Ryuuzouji was really nervous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like that's normal for an academic person.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I don't know why he'd want to rearrange the furniture.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Rearranging the furniture? I feel like I heard that somewhere before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where was it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, what were you doing looking into the well?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you trying to make a wish?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it. I was just looking inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I get it. Sometimes we all just want to look at the bottom of a well.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you talking about? Dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was⋯searching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you drop a sanitary product in the water?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is that all you can think about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup. That's it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're scrunching up your eyebrows.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's a dry well. There's no water anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A dry well, huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. It looks pretty deep, but they say there's no more water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, so why were you looking into it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I thought I'd try to find something more useful before you got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something useful?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do you remember that torn page from the journal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was just last night, of course I remember.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The page that you said Ryuuzouji wrote, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. I found it near this well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The journal page was found near the well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's strange enough by itself.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh⋯ You do this with all the girls, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not! Then I'd just be a pervert.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then why do you do it with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because you're Mitsuki⋯ I guess?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, are you embarrassed?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]D-Don't be stupid. I'm just glad you're not hurt. Can you stand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just⋯umm, I have a little vertigo.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Really? Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I'm okay, but I'm kind of dizzy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You should stay like that for a while. Don't push yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I won't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She'd get mad if I told her the view is what's making me dizzy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She look is looking at me, worried.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's kind of warm.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mitsuki's hair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always has it perfectly set.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks more natural when it's a little messy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Are you okay? Did you hit your head?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I⋯ I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've always thought that cleavage was dangerous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's clothes are very 「adult.」)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's wrapped in a business suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki looks good in that adult-looking outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop. Mitsuki will notice.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's the matter with you? You keep jutting your mouth forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. Umm, I was just testing the possibilities.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't make such impossible requests.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Fantasy and reality should remain separated.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Letting reason win is what makes us grown-ups.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're beautiful legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki's bare legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stockings are fine, but bare legs are the best.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to think about that stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is squatted down in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's quiet. The sunlight is a little bright.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's plant life growing all around.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's grass growing under my back, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means I'm laying on the ground.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's your plan using that there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Be serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I'm more interested with what's in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. It's not the time to use that.)[%p]
