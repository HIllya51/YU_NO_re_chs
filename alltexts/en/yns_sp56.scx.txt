[name]Takuya[line]Everything out here looks exactly the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The heat, the sand⋯and the humidity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sweating just standing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've only been walking for about an hour and I'm sweating⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't make any mistakes judging the distance out here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she's still following me through this desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna tell her again. I told her over and over not to follow me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She keeps doing it anyway. I guess there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯ I bet she thinks I'll notice and turn back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's basically making fun of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe she trusts me⋯ Nah, no way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long does she actually plan on following me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have food and water⋯ And a cloth to protect me from the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't have a thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope, no way. If I let pity sway me, I'll lose my goal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the point of spending a week walking, sweating, and searching for a way home if I give up now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I can't let pity sway me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long do you plan on following me around?![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong with you? Trotting after me like a puppy![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We've only been walking for an hour. You can still go back.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said go back. Go![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said GO![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ It's like talking to a wall.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*glance*[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
*pat pat pat pat*[%p]
*trot trot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's still there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't care anymore⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I. Don't. Care.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is pretty⋯no⋯really⋯tough⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Celes still following me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it. If I look back now, it'll just encourage her to keep going⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need⋯water⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The water's going quicker than I planned⋯ Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've already drunk this much water, but Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯hasn't had a drop to drink. Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I give her water now she'll keep chasing me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I even saying?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cele–[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an earthquake![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no, the water![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I dropped it⋯ Ah, damn it all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now⋯it's all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rage of mother nature⋯ Dela Grante in danger⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And there is only one priestess who can calm the outrage of mother nature⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? She's not here. She was here just a few hours ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes! Where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it, she can't speak. She won't be able to say anything even if she can hear me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But since I can't see her, she must have given up and gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how much water you have, it isn't enough for this desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Celes didn't have a cloth to cover her, nor any water⋯ Oh shit, water![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ I spilled my drinking water across the desert like a total dumbass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll never get to the Imperial Capital like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯ Did Celes use her powers to wake the wrath of mother nature?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes and her powers⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I have to go back. I'll get dehydrated in no time without any water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ I have to walk for a few more hours.[%p]
