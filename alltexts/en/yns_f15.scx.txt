[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obviously. She's probably on her way over there right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here⋯which means I entered uninvited again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯ What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is that coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she hasn't come back yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I came in uninvited again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯? But then, why was the door open?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. It's Houjou, that middle-aged guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy must have been going through her apartment. He's no better than a robber.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I came in here without permission too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello⋯? I let myself in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think of it, she was saying something about the beach when she collapsed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me she went out in her condition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't pass her on the way over here.[%p]
