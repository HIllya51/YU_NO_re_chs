[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? Why are you still here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This isn't the world where you belong. Go! Hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯ What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is smiling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's grinning for some reason.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has a great smile, but I wonder what makes her smile in this situation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well. I need to hurry.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? Hurry![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Chief Arima![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. I should open the map and make a quick jump⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or I can start over and select 「Keep Map and Items as is.」[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I don't know either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Watch out for Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This ruckus is all his fault.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't believe it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's true. Also Kaori Asakura, those two are partners.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right. I'll be careful. Now go, hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah. Oh, one more thing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's journal was in the study, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That is correct.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now his study is empty.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ Ryuuzouji took everything out early yesterday morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yesterday morning⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means they were still there the night before yesterday.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Chief Arima! Open the door![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Go! Hurry![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Chief Arima![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. I'm leaving.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If you see Koudai⋯give him my best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will. I'll tell him not to make you worry⋯and to make sure he comes home soon.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I wonder if Koudai will come home alone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Chief Arima! I know you're in there![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ I know the old bastard will come home! I promise I'll bring him back!!![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay. There's no reason for me to stick around any longer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just need to leave, fast!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Now that I think about it, my research started from Koudai's personal speculations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said my mother is alive somewhere, but where?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know. Koudai was the only one who knew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So there's a possibility she isn't alive.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, probably the same chance as Koudai being alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((That's weird. No one's here.))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Search this whole area one more time!))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Looks like time's running out. You better not stick around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't, but how can I get out?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You have something that lets you escape from anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Use it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I do that, you'll be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi, what are yo–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Shh⋯ Be quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know which world's Takuya you are, but I pray you get back on your own path.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi⋯ I can't leave you alone.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's okay. If you leave, another Takuya will appear in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Probably. If there are parallel worlds, then that thread must be closed and preserved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, what⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So even if you go to the next world, a Takuya from another world will come again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Honestly⋯ I have no clue what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, despite my looks, I am a scientist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]That office is suspicious⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Don't leave it just because it's the head facilitator's⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hurry. There's no time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I take this, it'll cause more trouble for you, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll be all right. There was no one here, and no stone. It'll be best if you take it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your research is all about that stone, huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah, you saw it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Koudai asked me to find a way to create crystals from the Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I heard, too. Just what's up with that stone?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's a long story, but you should probably be told about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That ore is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a stone that reacts to people's consciousness, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You know your stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry to interrupt. Keep going.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]At first, I didn't know why Koudai was so interested in that stone. Well, that is until recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about now?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Now I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai used to close himself in his study and make notes in his journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His journal, huh.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I happened to see those notes one day, when I was handing Koudai's things to Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai's notes fell out from a large stack of papers. And I read what was written there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]About you, Takuya, and Koudai's concept of parallel worlds. It was all very shocking. But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What really shocked me was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The fact that Koudai still loves your real mother, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That ore is a mysterious stone. No one knows why it's buried beneath Sakaimachi. Koudai was the only one to understand it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did the old bastard want?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai wanted to use that stone to go see your real mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My⋯real mother?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't be serious. My mother has been⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dead⋯ That's what Koudai told you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your real mother is alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-My mother is⋯alive?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, she is. At least, that's what Koudai thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My mother is alive?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My mother⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Last night⋯ I read that letter sent to you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean, my old man's letter⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ You read it after I dropped it in the living room⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what did you think?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Honestly, I was shocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, I'm impressed you were able to accept it, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]At first⋯ I wasn't sure about it, either. But for some reason, I felt it was right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because it's my father?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel⋯conflicted.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, that alarm is my fault. I broke in even though I knew it was wrong.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If you knew it was wrong, why did you do it?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's okay, I'm not going to give some stale lecture. I'm only teasing you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hahaha. You sure are funny, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is pounding⋯ Whew.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Were you the one who broke in last night as well?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, just tonight⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Although it was wrong, I'm sure there was a reason why you had to do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, all you need in life is an understanding stepmother.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ I trust you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Were you worried?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I never thought this would end happily. I'm afraid I've placed you in a bad position, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't worry about my position. You should get back to the path you belong on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's what Koudai said. I trust him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She knows?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi, do you know what's really going on⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that I think about it, I've never seen her hair down when she's in a suit⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair looks great every single day⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. I don't have time to stare at her hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that I think about it, I've never seen her hair down when she's in a suit⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair looks great every single day⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. I don't have time to stare at her hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I really be looking at her chest now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like her casual clothes, but she also looks great in business attire⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not her hands. Let's talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They look so soft and smooth⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi. What is she doing here?)[%p]
