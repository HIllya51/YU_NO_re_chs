[name]Takuya[line]The door opened. We can move on ahead.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯ Be careful![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's check it out. We might find something.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at the door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made of stone. It doesn't look like I can open it with my own strength.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Even my strength wouldn't be enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one mentioned you trying to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this⋯door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rather, is it even really a door⋯?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What the⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lodged right in there. I don't think we can get it out.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah⋯ I wonder if that was the right choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It fits right in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect size.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Do you really think that was the right choice?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like part of a crown with a medal embedded in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing about it really stands out as strange⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Actually, you be better off saying it's all strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a carving of a crown on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A crown?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯ What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's a crown, which means it might not be from Japan's ancient history⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not necessarily. Missionaries and evangelists used to visit Japan all the time in the past.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which means what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh come on⋯ I don't know why the crown is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, let's say you were the very person who built this underground road.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]B-But I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just an example.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not sure what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would they carve a crown here, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are you saying I had someone carve it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, you ordered someone to carve a crown. Why?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Haha, right⋯ If it were me, I'd do it to show everyone how important I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh, that's snooty. Good.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Awh, you're too kind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That wasn't a compliment.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aww⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that snootiness is on the right track. Throughout history, decorations like this were used a lot as symbols of authority.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like you know the Great Wall of China, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, I've read about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Qin Emperor had the wall stretched by over a thousand miles, mostly to show off his own power.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems stupid to modern people like us, but they were totally serious about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So is this another symbol of power?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's possible, but I can't understand why it's a crown.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I wonder if it means something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The crown does seem meaningful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just don't know what it means.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does this mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Honestly, I have no idea what it could possibly mean⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same as the one we saw in the other passage. Wait, no⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The pattern is slightly different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It was a scary face before, but now it's a crown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is a crown, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what this is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should look at it more closely⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is polished, and there's something carved into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm, I wouldn't know. Don't you know about this kind of thing, Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know either. It kind of looks like a crown though.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]A crown? But why would there be a crown carved into this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what this is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should look at it more closely⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? You're taking it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get the feeling we should take it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Black Medal][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Black Medal][color index="800000"].
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? You're taking it? It fit in there so nice though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get the feeling we should take it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][White Medal][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][White Medal][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]The craggy rock was smoothed down, and a crown was carved into it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is it some kind of carving?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what it's for though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole here. What could it be for?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's a small hole. It looks about the size of a five yen coin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a rock⋯ Not really all that interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is soaking wet⋯ I should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are jagged rocks jutting out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is slightly wet⋯ Maybe water dripped down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I feel like it got much colder as soon as we got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just you⋯ Maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The Black Medal is already in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯ Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The White Medal is already embedded in it, so you can't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are you all right, Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I tried putting the White Medal in⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It looks like it fits perfectly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it is the exact size⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I put the White Medal in. It fits perfectly.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So maybe the medal was supposed to go in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe. I'm not sure what its exact purpose is though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, Boss Man! Look at the door![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is this⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It looks like we can get through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-Wh-What? It w-went out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like a broken record. Come on, the light just went out, that's all. No need to panic.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay, b-but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're fine.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay, sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems so dimwitted all the time, but I think he's actually afraid of the dark.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's nyctophobia⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We need to get this done as soon as possible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this goes here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The standards are slightly off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on. I can't use that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, almost like it's telling us to go forward⋯ Let's move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The passage does seem to go on further ahead⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Should we just keep going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in staying here, is there?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I'll go first. You can stay behind me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You went quiet as soon as it got dark.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's not like that⋯ I'm just worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried, too⋯about Mio.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay, I'll go first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Will I find Mio up ahead⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's dark⋯ I should be careful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could possibly be up ahead?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that noise?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, above you!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yuuki?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-What happened? It closed again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you do?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I didn't do anything⋯ Well, besides touching the disc part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You touched what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, it was in there so snug, so I wanted to spin it a little. Then it closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it, you can't do anything right![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]S-Sorry⋯ It looks like it closes if you take the disc out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrn⋯ This thing is really sturdy.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should we do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something. I'll try kicking it this time. Stay back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯ All that did was hurt my foot. The door is stronger than it looks.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should I do, Boss Man!?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I'm thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it. I just need to find a way to open this door.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I seriously doubt Yuuki and I can open this with our strength alone though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only we had something to break this thing down.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to go on ahead and try to find something.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't move it by ourselves. I need some kind of tool or weapon.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]L-Like a rocket launcher or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What are you going to do then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Try to find something other than a rocket launcher that can break this door.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Can something other than a rocket launcher break it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough with the rocket launcher.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we can't break this thing down, we're done for.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-You're right. What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You stay here, Yuuki. I'm going to go on ahead and see if there's anything we can use.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, what⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's going to be fine. I'll be back, I promise. Just don't move from there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, almost like it's telling us to go forward⋯ Let's move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The path goes even farther.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Should we just keep going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in staying here, is there?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I'll go first. You can stay behind me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You went quiet as soon as it got dark.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's not like that⋯ I'm just worried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried, too⋯about Mio.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay, I'll go first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is Mio this way?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's dark⋯ I should be careful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could possibly be up ahead?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that noise?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, above you!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yuuki?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-What happened? It closed again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second. This door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrn⋯ This thing is really sturdy.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should we do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something. I'll try kicking it this time. Stay back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow. All that did was hurt my foot. The door is stronger than it looks.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should I do, Boss Man!?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I'm thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it. Did we do something wrong?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We put in the two medals, and the door opened⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! I have no idea what's going on. I need to find a way to open this door.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I seriously doubt Yuuki and I can open this with our strength alone though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only we had something to break this thing down.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to go on ahead and try to find something.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't move it by ourselves. I need some kind of tool or weapon.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]L-Like a rocket launcher or something?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]If we can't break this thing down, we're done for.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-You're right. What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You stay here, Yuuki. I'm going to go on ahead and see if there's anything we can use.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, wha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's going to be fine. I'll be back, I promise. Don't move from there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the door is open. There's no need to go back.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, maybe we should keep going forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or should we go back the way we came?[%p]
