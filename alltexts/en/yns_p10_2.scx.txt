[name]Takuya[line]The weather is nice today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why did I come the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nice on the rooftop, like always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can smell the ocean. You can see the ocean over by the handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because it's already summer vacation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like everyone went home already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I can see the ocean over the handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's still under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, that big pointy rock in front of me is Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I look at it one more time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it'll change if I look again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yep, still the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it'll be the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is so beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it'll just be the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, why did I come the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry downstairs.[%p]
