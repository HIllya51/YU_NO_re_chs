[name]Takuya[line]There's not even the tiniest sound in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where should I look for Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nobody in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the only one in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah, look at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the only one in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, as usual everyone is just hanging out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are these students doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they're both in the same club or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They seem to be talking about their plans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't any more people in front of the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably because they took that poster down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But who did it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came down to the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to the center of town.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where I'm going, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry up and get Mio's book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's almost night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial lessons are over, but there are still a lot of students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back when it was in style, someone put lighting all over this room. It's stupid, really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All it does is make my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's what they call indirect lighting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Indirect lighting is supposed to be done with some kind of padding on the cover or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night now. They must be doing oxygen breathing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel stuffy, but at the same time⋯ I don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it⋯ Plants perform photosynthesis during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it should be increasing oxygen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, it's this thing's fault⋯ Plants take in oxygen, which increases CO2 in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why it's so stuffy in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is probably the only one using it, since she's the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there an ashtray in the school's hall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it for guests?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a circular sofa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to be some kind of artwork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An 「exhibit.」 That's what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a strange object hanging from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it's supposed to represent the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know who drew the big picture there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to represent the sun⋯ I think I learned that when I started here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone told me that skylight opens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you open that? It is electric?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stars are shining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a skylight to bring in more light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes it bright and pleasant in here.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your current coordinate values. You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more written below⋯[%p]
「Be on the lookout for your current completion rate as well. Please use these in conjunction with each other.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there are any new postings.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your coordinate values on your map.」[%p]
「You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it mean? I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, so I'll fail once or twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got a nosebleed so bad it's dripping onto your fist, you dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What doesn't she know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll ask. Hey![%p]
[name]Student[line]Never heard of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people attending club activities look much more relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are all those guys in remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may not see it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know everything about the school, but I know a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a school building directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary and offices are on the first floor down the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our classrooms are on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't tell if this student is male or female.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't touch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around in the school hallway isn't going to get anything done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Some of the female students got really noisy all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I heard an accident happened on the coast last night.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]It's a little tough to imagine a lightning strike. The weather was so clear last night, I could see the stars.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Then, what caused it?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]There have been a lot of accidents lately.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I really don't like that noise. Do you?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]A while ago, I heard a terrible sound outside. Like an explosion.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I heard a truck flared up along the coast last night.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I wonder if that's connected to the lightning strike.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You know yesterday's lightning accident? I heard a rumor that lightning is striking regardless if it's sunny, stormy, or anything in between.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There have been lightning strikes all over the place.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Maybe it's just a matter of figuring out how it works.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There have been so many lightning strikes lately⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The weather's always so good though.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There was a terrible noise at that briefing in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]My mother is part of the opposition movement. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Was it really a lightning strike? The weather's too nice for that.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]A lightning strike on the coastline?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you kidding? Look outside. It's so sunny.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It can't be. Shimazu is⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Everyone in school is talking about it.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, did you hear?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I heard Geo Technics will be undergoing an investigation soon.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It's got something to do with the current mayor and corruption.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There were similar things written on the paper posted over there.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I can't believe what her father was up to. I feel bad for Mio.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]And that lightning is really strange.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Why it always strikes the ocean is a mystery.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It's a nice day today.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I can't believe that lightning accident was only yesterday.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You're asking if I saw a creep wearing weird clothes?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Yeah, I saw him.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]He's talking to me right now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, don't look so insulted.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There's no way lighting would strike like that on such a clear day.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you taking about that sound?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You must be hearing things.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]With what's happening to her father⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I wonder what she's going to do now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I just heard on the radio that Mayor Shimazu resigned.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Wow, it's happening just like that poster said.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That anonymous journalist is pretty good at what she does.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Would someone normally incriminate their own father?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I wonder if something's going on inside that family.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]So, did you see that poster?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It looked like Shimazu's confession.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]By the way, where is Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry, I don't know anything.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You want to know if I know what's going on at Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Did you ask if I heard a terrible sound?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Well, I've actually had some trouble with my hearing lately.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yes? What?[%p]
[name]Student[line]There was an interesting scoop pasted there until recently.[%p]
[name]Student[line]It was so crowded I couldn't see it.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yes? What?[%p]
[name]Student[line]There is something interesting written on this bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, long time no see. Nice to see you again.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got good news to share, but it's kind of a long story.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]It takes a while to explain, but do you wanna hear?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]You will soon go to a dark place.[%p]
[name]Student[line]And there you will face uncommon circumstances.[%p]
[name]Student[line]What uncommon circumstances?[%p]
[name]Student[line]You won't be able to do something that you could normally do.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But you can't panic. Be calm.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yes, act calmly.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Before you arrive there, I recommend you use the Jewel. Before you go to the dark place, use the Jewel.[%p]
[name]Student[line]「Look」 and 「Think」 carefully before you act.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I know you will find the way.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Listen, I'll say this one more time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Look closely, think, and make one decision at a time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]That is the fastest way.[%p]
[name]Student[line]When we meet again in another parallel world, I may just give you another hint.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]Shh⋯ I'm experiencing the waves of the world right now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got some information to share with you, but it'll take time to explain.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you want to hear it again?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]To 「Talk」 is fundamental.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Talk to many people around you.[%p]
[name]Student[line]By doing so, you will know the conditions of the current world and what's going on around you.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Then, the path shall open up for you.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Talk to me periodically as well. What people have to say will change all the time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Why don't you try it out by deepening your friendship with the students in this main hall?[%p]
[name]Student[line]When we meet again in another parallel world, I may just give you another hint.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary. I wonder if Ms. Eriko is there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get it together. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko's gonna end up getting mad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are we going again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing for me at the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ Might as well go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have plans at the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll do what I need to do before I go wandering off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way to the school infirmary. I wonder if Ms. Eriko is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go check out the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try going to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, Mio went up to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like Mio's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she on the second floor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came down from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the book Mio forgot is on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, here I go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Off to the second floor![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well if that's how it is, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should hurry back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gonna be so mad at me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't get Mio's book yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where it is, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside![%p]
