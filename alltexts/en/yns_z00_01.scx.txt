[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What in the world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where the hell is this place?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I heard it coming from over there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sound⋯ Where did it come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to find it⋯ It came from there, I think⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could I possibly be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we check it out and see a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, Meiunji Park![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was definitely a forest in that park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. Even though there was a fountain, there wasn't a flowing stream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Also, there were not so many planted trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, you can hear the birds chirping⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there were such forests in Sakaimachi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just noticed, but I don't have anything at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The reflector, too⋯ Everything I had⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all gone?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only things I have on me are⋯clothes and shoes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I also have underwear, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, this is an emergency situation, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I in the woods? What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyone here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calm down⋯ It's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I need to understand what's going on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like⋯ I'm in the woods⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woods⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was there a forest in Sakaimachi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not the river.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no way you can hear rustling noises from the flowing river.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there⋯ I heard something from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was there a place with a flowing stream in Sakaimachi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold water⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see fish⋯or anything else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A flowing stream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's water flowing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, I heard it come from the forest![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Footsteps⋯ It doesn't sound like a beast⋯ It's the sound of someone running![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's chase them anyway![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, please! There is something I need to ask you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So fast⋯*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I'm out of breath⋯ Wish I exercised more frequently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why are you running? Do you need to run away from me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bush on the right side⋯ I won't let it escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]C-Calm down⋯calm down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hold on to the grass⋯ Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gently, gently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heave-ho⋯heave-ho.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯ I am alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this cliff⋯ Why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a sheer cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look down⋯ It's like a couple hundred feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet there is some illusion, too. It's quite high, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lower part is hidden in a sea of clouds and cannot be seen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means we're at a really high altitude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Higher than that cloud, at least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, it's wiser to leave this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It should be okay now⋯ Stand up, pull back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, did I hit someone?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]⋯!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who⋯are you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this woman?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's nothing special about it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are strangely shaped trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bending sideways⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Trees everywhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind is making the leaves sing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is not along the path⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard that sound from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did it come from⋯the end of this path?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels a little different⋯ It should be a place with more trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a road⋯isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no pavement, but there are parts where the ground is exposed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems to be different from animal trails⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if something walks through here all the time⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that 「something」 be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has to be a road.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where do I go? Where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go anywhere now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get a hold of the situation first⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go anywhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, I don't even know where I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to get a hold of the situation⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where⋯where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sound⋯ Where did it come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Standing here won't help me with anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am gonna go for a walk and look around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Walk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air is so fresh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sunlight is blocked by the shade of trees and not as hot as it would be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound of the river is music to my ears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I haven't taken a walk in the shade like this for many years⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can lie on the grass and take a nap while watching the sky, I know it will feel like paradise⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hehe, you have room to breathe now, Takuya. Way to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, explore this area, check my current position, and then think of a game plan⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Again⋯ That noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something out there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, who's there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, is it a beast or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The current situation is that I'm in the forest, and the thing to do now is to locate that sound.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, walking around here is not gonna bother anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know this place and I don't even know where I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means walking around here won't affect the situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I need to figure out the current situation. That will be my first plan⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a river in the forest. Birds are singing and sunlight shines through the trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's obvious that this is not at the foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no place like this in Sakaimachi. At least, not that I know of.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that means, this is not Sakaimachi, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not Sakaimachi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, I wonder where this place is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why I am here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember entering the underground path beneath Triangle Mountain⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I was exploring underneath Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Suddenly, I was out like a light, and then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what happened to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, my memory is not clear⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would make sense to think that while I lost consciousness, someone carried me here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone carried me here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you can hear me, say something![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I just imagining things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An animal or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
