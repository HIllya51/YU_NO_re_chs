[name]Takuya[line]There's no one in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi went back to her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is sitting right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi went back to her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're just a man and a woman eating together in a living room. Alone. At night.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, you have some rice stuck to your lip.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way this could turn into something weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little big for just two people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's looking at me like I'm a kid.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I am rather young.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's my stepmother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she's only about ten years older than me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already ate. I don't need to look at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I keep looking at that, I'm gonna barf.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's gross, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, the food you made looks great.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I just threw it together. You don't have to compliment me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, really. It's amazing you can make something thrown together look so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna scarf that down in a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her legs look so soft and smooth.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The way she looks with her legs crossed like that⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? Why are you bent over under the table like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I'm just uh⋯chewing cud like a cow. *gag*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ugh⋯ Don't do things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she noticed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She'll figure it out if I stare too much.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Aah! Did she see me?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't stick your chopsticks straight up in your food like that. It's bad manners. You look like you're making an offering to the dead or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]My skirt ripped! I just bought this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't notice. It looks fine to me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh. Good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This has got to be bad for me. I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't stare at my stepmother's legs like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Isn't there a girl you like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sneeze* Dammit. Huh? What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're not getting off that easy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know what I like? I like plum cream puffs without the plum.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I was talking about a person you like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really like the Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Yukawa Hideki. I respect him. Very much. He's very accomplished.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh come on! A girl. I'm talking about a girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Elizabeth Taylor?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm talking about a girl you have feelings for, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I can't have feelings for Elizabeth Taylor?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Families are built on trust, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ugh. Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I win![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're still a kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grrr⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine. Since we're sharing, who do you like most, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Who do I like most?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dr. Arima, I guess?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stupid! I'm so stupid!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! I am such an inconsiderate moron!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of all the things I could say, I choose that! I could die right now!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]U-Um⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi? That was inconsiderate of me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There⋯ There is another person I like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Someone I like just as much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As much as my old man?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Who is it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, he tries to act like an adult, but he's actually pretty sweet and innocent. He cares about others, and he's very kind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He instantly regrets saying hurtful things and apologizes immediately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]And he's part of my family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wash your face and get to bed. Goodnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She⋯ She kissed me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa. Calm down, Takuya. Calm down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was just a little peck on the cheek. Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said I was her family. She cares about me like family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing more, nothing less.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that has to be it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with my heart thumping so loudly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I'm pitiful. I'm getting worked up over a tiny kiss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So how about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your future.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna be a husband.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I've already heard that one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to intimidate me with that face?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Be serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯ Then let me ask you something.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What would that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to know what you want as a mother.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I hope you take the path that is best for you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not fair.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How is that not fair? That's how I feel. I don't want you to regret anything. I want you to do what's best for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's best for me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What would that even be?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That reminds me, I got a call from your advisor. Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Takeda?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, the funny one that smokes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's more weird than funny, I'd say.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What will you do, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your future.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna grow up and get married.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that enough?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If that's all you plan to do, then you'd better marry rich.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't take it so seriously.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, that girl that was with you before, Ms. Shimazu?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She just followed me after I left class. I'd never do anything with her, not in a million years.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your face is clearly saying, 『Is that so?』[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's because I'm wondering if that's so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm just happy to see that you've finally started dating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be crazy. It's nothing. Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](God, I bring her here once, and this is what is happens.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if all mothers are like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me of what I saw on TV earlier.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What would that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coverage of the construction on the coastline.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is everything really all right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm. That news show covered everything.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's all fine, of course. I always put the safety of the workers first. I just think it's best to halt construction until we discover the cause.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I worry about you, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You don't need to. I almost never go to the site. But thank you for worrying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well if you don't go to the site, then I guess it's not so bad.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't be so quick to dismiss it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're safe, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm safe, yes, but there are other people at that construction site right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't very well send others into danger while I sit back in safety.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. You're right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But the company has ordered us to continue. I don't know what to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what that call was about.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, I can't tell people about this. It's a secret, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't say anything, but⋯ That's a little strange, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lightning strikes are super rare. The coastline's always been calm.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's something even more mysterious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]More mysterious?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. There's a lightning storm every time we try to clear earth out of the site. Every. Time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Some of the more superstitious locals think the god of the sea is angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not very logical.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But it's true. So now the construction has stopped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Lightning strikes whenever they try to clear dirt?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's strange⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I only half believe it myself. And I'm sure you don't believe it, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't. Isn't it more constructive to consider the lightning strikes as coincidence and look for another cause?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, of course. We're already conducting a thorough investigation. But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They still haven't found the cause.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I've halted any transportation for the time being. But my bosses are asking me what I'm doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It would be much easier if the locals weren't so upset about the construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But lightning is a natural disaster. Is your company worried about that too?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let's just say that's a problem for management.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have to stop talking about work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I got so worked up talking about all of that, I actually got warm. Phew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, did you know we have fever medication in the house?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Fever medication?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's a home remedy my mother–I mean, my father's previous wife made.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used to get fevers a lot when I was a kid. So I took it all the time. It works really well.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks, but I'm fine. I'm just a little sweaty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for the food.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're welcome! You really wolfed it down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was nothing in my stomach.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You've got some rice stuck to your lip.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll get it for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's okay. Here. I've got that handkerchief you always put in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I get it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yep, got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew! I've never been so full![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You should have had something delivered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like your cooking, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, it's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course it's not nothing! Don't say that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm, your father always used to say he preferred my cooking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you apologizing?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He was your only blood-related family, I'm just⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't talk like that. We're family, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're sad, then I'm sad too. Family isn't just about blood.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're right. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said don't apologize.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, what am I so angry about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want to talk or eat. It's one or the other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the middle of eating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gobbling up my food right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should 『Eat』 before you 『Talk.』[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's plenty, so eat as much as you want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't eat anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'm ready to go back to my room and pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which reminds me, Ayumi told me to wash my face and go to bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is my face that dirty?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I'll wash my face. Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Ayumi's lipstick on my cheek?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I kind of regret washing my face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, I need to sleep. Now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just Ayumi and I now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's going to happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This house is kind of lonely without my old man around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's Ayumi going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, it's time to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Goodnight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Still⋯ Whew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh? Wath wong?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't talk with your mouth full.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch* *gulp* What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I made enough for two. I can't believe there's nothing left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough for two is enough for half of me. *munch munch* So good![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, really! This fried chicken is amazing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not fried chicken from the supermarket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't believe frying it yourself makes this much of a difference![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're being awfully nice. What are you trying to get? I just gave you money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm being honest. I swear, I'd tell you if it wasn't good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I suppose that's true. You've always been very honest with me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Uh-oh, you spilled some. Open up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek! Don't eat my finger with it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch* Hey, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you tell me to open up like I'm a kid? I'm an adult.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You ate it, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to waste food.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're still so young.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know how to handle these feelings. Better to drown them in food for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch munch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're going to choke if you don't slow down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrgh!! *thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here. Have some water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp* Ahh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so good. I couldn't help eating it so fast.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I already gave you some cash.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not trying to suck up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you looking at me like that?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You just look like you're really enjoying it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really is good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Seeing someone I love enjoying the food I made makes me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong, Takuya? You dropped your fork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ We're family, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, that's right. You're my son, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I want you to eat lots and be healthy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. You're right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, what's wrong? Why did you stop eating?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ I'm full.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're finished?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It was good. Really.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks. Since you liked it, I'll make it again sometime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her child?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hahaha! What am I thinking?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do you want to eat again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No. I'm full.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*buurrp*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh my! Is that a hidden talent I hear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant* Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here. Have some water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not choking or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to eat![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have more ingredients. Should I make more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This won't work on Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't see me as a man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's actually kind of disappointing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's stupid anyway. I should stop thinking about it.)[%p]
