[name]Takuya[line]My room⋯ I'll read my father's letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I use my father's letter, I can read it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was going to look at my father's letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Change the control method with the :btnR1: and Use Father's Letter to read it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I was talking nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to read it fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at that won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look at my father's letter now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's letter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll read the whole thing again.[%p]
「To my dear, underachieving son⋯」[%p]
「If it turns out that you have as brilliant a mind as I do, then one day, you will most certainly unravel the complicated threads of history as I have.」[%p]
「And that means a new end and new beginning for all of mankind.」[%p]
「But what is the true meaning of history? Have you ever considered that, Takuya?」[%p]
「I once thought history was a record of the changes that occur as the past moves to the present.」[%p]
「I thought that it was the record and shape of the changes and fluidity of human society.」[%p]
「At least, that's what I thought until now.」[%p]
「Historians like us believe our study of history is important, that the time we dedicated to it was well spent. And so we continued researching, wasting every day.」[%p]
「But let's make a different assumption. What if the path from the past to the present wasn't just a one-way road?」[%p]
「Then what is history? The record of mankind's changes? No, it's nothing more than a record of phenomena that happened at specific times. That's not history.」[%p]
「The flow of time is not an irreversible phenomenon. You must understand that it is a reversible concept.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flow of time is reversible. You can go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I first read this, I just thought that bastard was crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll read the beginning.[%p]
「So does that mean it is possible to repeat history?」[%p]
「Not quite. History is an irreversible concept. The difference here is both miniscule and enormous.」[%p]
「When I made that discovery, I decided to go to a certain place.」[%p]
「History can't be repeated, but the flow of time is reversible.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really understand this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you can reverse the flow of time, shouldn't you be able to change history?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flow of time and the flow of history are different things. That must be what he's explaining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what is the flow of history?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to keep reading.[%p]
「By the time you read this, I'll be long gone. However, this doesn't mean I am dead.」[%p]
「You should see two items in front of you. One is a mirror, and the other is a device with a very specific purpose.」[%p]
「The mirror is a keepsake left by your mother, Keiko. The strong connection between you and your mother ties you to that place.」[%p]
「The other is a device. The details of how it works can be found in the second drawer from the top.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It was Professor Imagawa's paper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The user manual for this Reflector Device was written in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Parallel worlds. That's what he's talking about. Like the theory written in Professor Imagawa's paper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean Ayumi isn't the Ayumi that I know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that was written in Professor Imagawa's paper too.[%p]
「If one loses sight of the world they should be in, there is no guarantee they can return to it. It is necessary for us to consider the meaning of the infinite⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no guarantee that you can return to your own world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means it's possible that Ayumi isn't the Ayumi I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi is Ayumi. She's the same as always. Nothing's different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Professor Imagawa's paper said there are infinite, slightly different parallel worlds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Infinite worlds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where did the Ryuuzouji and Ayumi from that time go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, my current predicament is more important than discovering where they went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did I go? That's the question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((The old man said he was just somewhere else.))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((At least, that's what he wrote.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((But is it a place I can find with this device?))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((Right.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What the hell is this device?))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((I already told you. It's a device that allows you to see the possibilities of space that exist within infinity.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Does that means my old man is alive somewhere in another world?))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((That's not quite it. He's in the same place as us.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The same place, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, no matter how you look at it, I've come beyond the point of no return.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't think about what I should have done, but rather what I should do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's use this to find the bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going off what the letter and Professor Imagawa's theory said, he might be somewhere in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to believe, but I have something I can't believe in my very hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just turn a blind eye to reality now, can I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I think this may be the only thing I can do right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once I find the bastard, I'll clock him in the face and then hear what he has to say. I'll think of what to do after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I don't find him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll cross that bridge when we get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man⋯[%p]
