[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is weird. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I read this situation wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was pretty sure she would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one was here earlier, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing but the sea behind Triangle Mountain. No point in going there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So does that mean Kanna just appeared out of nowhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she wanted to check out Sword Cape for one last intellectual inquiry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the foot of Triangle Mountain is the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought Mio would be here, but I guess not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna was looking at something here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Sword Cape. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet. All I can hear is the sound of the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is where it all started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something carved on the side of this small rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a big deal. Nothing out of the ordinary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where Kanna was looking at something last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a perfectly normal mountain of rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she was examining something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a perfectly normal mountain of rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a perfectly normal mountain of rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some kind of letters. No need to read them now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First off, I don't even know what's written here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's said that they were written approximately 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be reading this now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That girl was on the ground here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was she, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could there really be something here at Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio seemed interested in this rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a regular rocky mountain to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is right there, as quiet as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Sword Cape. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do they call it the shrine? Just take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has a strangely solemn air to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. No one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like Mio's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you interested in the spot that woman was just looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
