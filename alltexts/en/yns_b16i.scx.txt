[name]Female Guard[line]What is that envelope?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, showing her this won't do anything for me.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, that card⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It looks like a security card for Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, that is what it is.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Ha, no. It can't be. There's no way you would have a security card to this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See for yourself.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, the emblem is on it. It'd be impossible to make a fake⋯ You mean it's real?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's what I've been saying.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Why do you have this? This card even allows access to restricted areas.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Chief Arima asked me to deliver it. She said she really needs it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]W-Wait a second. I'll go confirm that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is bad.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Just in case⋯ Wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't hurry, she's gonna be angry.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just so you know, I'll have to say it was a guard who made me late.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't hurry, the boss is gonna be mad.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be right back. I know where to go. I've been there before.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]V-Very well⋯you can use the card to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Don't wander off anywhere else though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]And come right back! You can't stay for too long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like my mother. I said I got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, got over that hurdle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't think a security card would have so much pull⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's true that I've been to Ayumi's office before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This building is fully automated, so there are barely any people here. That makes things pretty convenient for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I go through the lobby and down the hall, Ayumi's office should be around there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I'm going in!)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Wait, is that one of our security cards?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]No, it can't be.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What a beautiful medal⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What's it for?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Is that your Student Notebook?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]An old key⋯ Looks like it goes to a padlock.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Going to a discus competition or something?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Don't do it here, okay?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey⋯ What are you trying to do, taking something like that out here?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Eh, a toy?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Quit messing around.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]A wooden sword. I wonder which is stronger: your sword or my baton?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You plan on tying me up with that?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm not interested in stuff like that.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]The stamp on that document looks like the Geo Technics emblem.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I doubt it's the same though.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]The stamp on this document looks like the Geo Technics stamp for classified documents.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]However, that's impossible. There's no way you could have something like that.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What's with that picture?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What a beautiful medal⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That design gives me goose bumps though.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You must be the outdoorsy type to carry that around.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, that card⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It looks like a security card for Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, that is what it is.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Ha, no. It can't be. That's a Blue Card, the company's highest security clearance card. There's no way you could have one of those.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See for yourself.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, the emblem is on it. It'd be impossible to make a fake⋯ You mean it's real?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's what I've been saying.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Why do you have this? It allows access to the most restricted areas in the company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi asked me to deliver it. He said he really needs it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]W-Wait a second. I'll go confirm that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is bad.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Just in case⋯ Wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't hurry, he's gonna be angry.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just so you know, I'll have to say it was a guard who made me late.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't hurry, Toyotomi is gonna be mad.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be right back. I know where to go. I've been there before.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry. I won't get in the way of your work. I'll hand it right over and head straight back.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, in that case⋯ You are the head facilitator's son, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'm Ayumi's son.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well then, you can use the card to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Don't wander off anywhere else though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]And come right back! You can't stay for too long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like my mother. I said I got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, got over that hurdle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't think a security card would have so much pull⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Lies are just a means to an end. I guess that female guard has a soft spot for Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's true that I've been to Ayumi's office before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This building is fully automated, so there are barely any people here. That makes things pretty convenient for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I go through the lobby and down the hall, Ayumi's office should be around there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I'm going in!)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Wait, is that one of our Blue Cards?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]No, it can't be. The Blue Card provides the highest clearance in the building.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, I'm not supposed to tell people that⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Wow, what a pretty pebble.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What is that key?[%p]
