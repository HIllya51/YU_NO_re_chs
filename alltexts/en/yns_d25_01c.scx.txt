[name]Takuya[line](Mio is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]In his book, 「Legacy,」 Dr. Arima said, 「Their secrets could lie in Sakaimachi.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the secrets of the Celestials are in Sakaimachi?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That is correct.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, no matter where they are, they won't affect our lives.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, don't you have any passion for this stuff?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you have too much.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think the 「secrets」 Dr. Arima was talking about are hidden in Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think what you want, but don't confuse that with reality.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then what do you make of this? There's that slab on the Twin Boulders, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What if I told you that was from around 400 A.D.?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd say it was a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's your proof?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I feel it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you try to theorize just by feelings, the scholars of the world will mourn.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My feelings are right on. Even though it's not direct evidence, I do have a document that supports what I'm saying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]At my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I just remembered the President of the United States is at my house.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you calling me a liar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say that. It's just hard to believe.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then come to my house and I'll explain everything to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your house?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you coming or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Right now?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, let's go. I'll show it to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting kinda weird.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know where my house is, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think I've been there before.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have to go through the Heights. Okay? Okay, let's go.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know the theory regarding the 400 year cycle, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I did flip through some history book with my old man's name on it called 「A Book of Hard to Understand History.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then tell me what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's when every 400 years, something really big happens.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]To put it in less than layman's terms, yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an appropriate theory for a megalomaniac like that old bastard.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You think it's not realistically possible?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, there have been things like that happening throughout history, but it's not certain.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not so sure about that. What proof do you have that it's not certain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's your proof that it is?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Give me a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only logical, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Listen up. In the years 1600, 1200, 800, 400–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And year zero.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Dr. Arima has pointed out the event that took place around the year 400 in particular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened around 400 A.D.?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're such a dolt. It was the unification of Japan by the Yamato Dynasty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're not good at history, are you? It's a shame, seeing that your father was a historian.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, you can just look up the year in a dictionary or book when you need to. Memorization is not the essence of history.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to waste precious brain cells on stuff like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph, I didn't expect that from you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, around 400 A.D. a group of people claiming they were descendants of God invaded our ancestors, the indigenous people of Japan.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Exactly. There's a lot of different names for them, but Dr. Arima called them Celestials.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I remember him calling them something like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not something like that. That's exactly what he named them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't people say that if it weren't for them, Japan never would have been unified?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes. However, the full story behind the Celestials is still veiled in mystery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, that sounds like something straight out of a documentary.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Would you take this seriously for one second?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah. My old man's theory is just that, a theory. It doesn't have any support.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's a harsh thing to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn right. It must be nice to irresponsibly make stuff up.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what's in the book, anyway?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Right. Seeing as you're finally interested, I guess I can tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're going to build it up like that, I'll pass.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What? Don't you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not if you're going to build it up like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just said I'm going to tell you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Listen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just wants to tell me about it, doesn't she?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahem. In this book the man I respect, Dr. Arima⋯that's your dad, not you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I know that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This book was coauthored by three people, all of whom have impacted their own academic fields. It's based on the logical structures of Dr. Arima's theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Stop looking so bored.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, what's it about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahem. The preface is about the significance of history and its academic placement, as well as the thought process.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Very interesting.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Chapter one is about the theory of the 400 year cycle, chapter two proves it, and chapter three shows mathematical support.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mathematical support?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Radiation detection, methods on detecting carbon isotopes. Stuff like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that even mean?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They are measurement methods to determine exact years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The latter half is pretty difficult to understand, I couldn't figure it out at my current level of education.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's all Greek to you, huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? No⋯ Well, yeah. Kind of.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The preface was the significance of history, and chapter one was⋯what was it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Chapter one is the theory of the 400 year cycle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man's theory of the 400 year cycle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean, 「So?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you outside, didn't I? When I said I didn't know the book, you told me I was incorrigible.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You mean this 「Legacy」 book?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that 「Leg I see」 or whatever.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your own father wrote this book, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, really?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's right. Oh, you're just hopeless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only book I know my old man authored is 「A Book of Hard to Understand History.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's one of his famous works too, but 「Legacy」 is a bit different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, how is it different?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You really don't know anything, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obviously not.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This book was co-written by Dr. Arima, Headmaster Ryuuzouji, and Professor Imagawa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Arima, Ryuuzouji, and⋯ Imagawa?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Professor Imagawa is an expert in mathematical functions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Imagawa⋯ I feel like I've heard that name somewhere before.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, she's been in the newspaper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not it. It was something I was more involved with⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She was reported as missing recently. Maybe that's it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Missing?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. All traces of her vanished in the past few months.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Well, anyway. I know my old man and Ryuuzouji. They're both very much alike. Typical researchers. But who's Imagawa?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Professor Imagawa was hired for her expertise in mathematics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She's incredible. She has a doctorate in history and in physics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, She? She's a woman?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Tch, that's sexist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just asked if she was a woman, that's all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is it a problem that she is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she hot?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't get so angry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, I wonder if your brain is festering away into nothingness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯ Professor Imagawa.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An expert in physics and history⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times you look, her nose hairs aren't going to come out.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Don't be ridiculous![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just thinking about how cute you are.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have a cute little nose hair.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You–! No I don't![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're so sure, that must mean you cut them periodically.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't have time for morons like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Curly hair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hair is curly all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I pull it and let it go, it bounces right back.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, do you mind not playing with people's hair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her school uniform ribbon. I bet she'd get mad if I snatched it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the ribbon on Mio's uniform.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everyone that goes to Sakaimachi Academy has one.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really shouldn't⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, it feels malicious for it to be in such a perfect spot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't understand why I'd be hit if I can't even see it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop staring.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll slog you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That rhymes with hog.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's fine with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So can I call you a hog?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said it was fine.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. Who would be happy being called a hog?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so selfish.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're looking, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know⋯down there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Down there? Like at your shoes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not that low.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then about how low?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know, below the waist, above the thighs⋯don't make me say it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not making you say anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you just love this see-through table? Wait, what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mm, this is a nice table. Wait, what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-Nothing. It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's so thick⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm fine, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So thick, so juicy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What the heck are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A rich girl obsessed with ancient history.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That rich girl is Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only she weren't so obsessed with ancient history.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If you want it, just say so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, I don't want it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Want some sugar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't look at me so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just looking at the table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a very clear table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks to that, I can see Mio's thick, juicy legs.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't say gross things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a briar, not a liar.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants in the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This one is an imitation. Its sheen of plastic is almost sad.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. So even you feel things, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're inside the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't too many people in here, but not too few, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As its name says, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's a calming place.[%p]
