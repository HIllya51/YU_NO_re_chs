[name]Takuya[line]Did Yu-No feel anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet forest⋯ No monsters have appeared here ever since that day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No went into the forest with Kun-Kun⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had no idea that lizard was an omnivore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll eat anything⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Kun-Kun⋯ Come on![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds like she's looking for Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beautiful stream⋯ There were fish swimming in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The nuts and fish in the river are our only source of food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our diet could use some improvement.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The whispers of the trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the sunlight coming through the woods.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The scenery is fantastic⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should reach that cliff if I keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This path should take me to the cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute⋯ I should wait until Yu-No comes back with Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the path to the cliff⋯ I've already told Yu-No not to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything should be okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Illia mention something before⋯?
[name]Illia[line]((Dela Grantia will descend upon us⋯ By the sacred ritual, it shall rise within her⋯))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((The ritual shall take place in four years⋯))[%p]
[name]Illia[line]((I would like you to guard the Border in my place⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Four years until the ritual takes place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can recall Illia saying that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now it's been four years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be related?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia also mentioned the reign of God⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ There's no God out here. If there was, God would have granted my wish by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My wish to return to the world where I came from⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, something bothers me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Four years⋯ It's already been four years since Illia mentioned it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could possibly happen⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-It's a big one⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-This is a pretty big earthquake⋯ Is this just a coincidence?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did it stop⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Hey, Yu-No![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Daaaaaad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Is this that 「bad feeling」 you were talking about?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm not sure⋯but I still can't get rid of that feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still⋯?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah⋯ And it's getting stronger. My heart keeps on beating really fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our house![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a big one. I'm worried about our house.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh! But I still can't find Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to head home.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look for the lizard and come straight home, you understand?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come back soon![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head home now. I'm worried about our house after that earthquake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes used to be a priestess at the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A priestess⋯ Maybe that's why her senses are more heightened than the average person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope everything will be okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything about Yu-No and Celes is strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They both seemed to have been bothered by something lately⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Especially today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes couldn't even get up this morning⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First, I thought she might be sick, but I guess that 「bad feeling」 was stuck in her chest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
