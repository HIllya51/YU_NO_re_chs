[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all desert in every direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is really rough when the sun's up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And there's supposed to be sacred grounds beyond here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Temples can exist anywhere in the world⋯ But where's that temple Yu-No and I saw?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hot⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't you think we should've waited until night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's your fault for sleeping in, Amanda.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We said we should leave right after resting for an hour or two.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't we?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey⋯ What?! It's your fault, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You⋯were so nice all of a sudden⋯and I⋯had so much pent-up until then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's why you passed out?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What's wrong with you?! You were so sweet last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I didn't say anything![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's she so mad about?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There are parts of a lady's mind that morons will never understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lady? Where?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hrmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, whatever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm almost to the sacred temple⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And after that⋯ The Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desert really is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't think it would be this bad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The sun beating down is bad enough⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But the reflection off the sand makes it even worse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I would never have believed it would be this bad.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been almost a week since then.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I brought enough food for two weeks⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'm almost out⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If this continues any longer⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah⋯ I'm okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way that's true.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She should be really feeling the sun and this heat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If we don't keep drinking water, we'll be dehydrated in no time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's not much water left now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how much I walk, all I see is the desert.)[%p]
