[name]Takuya[line]It's my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so interesting about a lamp?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my room's light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, it's not really enough to light the whole room⋯ I suppose it's just decorative.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to read that right now. I should put it away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're almost all history books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old bastard gave them to me and told me to read them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'm partially responsible for actually reading them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This cushion's not very handy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've almost never used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't bother with something so meaningless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at it makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now's not the time to take a nap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shelf full of magazines.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shelf filled with magazines. There's hardly anything aside from books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not good at keeping things, so I don't have much to put inside of the shelf.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, look at the time![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really late, and there hasn't been a single phone call.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did something happen to Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to go straight to the police.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard Ryuuzouji said Ayumi would get in trouble if I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But maybe Ryuuzouji was just making that up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe he was just trying to buy some time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But for what reason?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she just called me, I wouldn't worry so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is bad. And I'm so tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Crud, why am I getting sleepy at a time like this? *yawn*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! I have to stay awake! Ayumi could call any time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I could sleep right next to the phone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no. What if I miss her call?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's almost morning⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just lay down for a minute. Just a minute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just one minute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My eyes are getting so heavy. Maybe I could just⋯ Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got to stay awake until Ayumi comes home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My eyes are so heavy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯please⋯be⋯okay⋯
[name]Koudai[line]((So⋯ Now you know, Ayumi⋯))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Oh, Koudai⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Hey! Call me teacher.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, teacher!))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Ah, that brings me back. How about a forbidden love affair between teacher and student?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, teacher.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Dad, quit acting like this is some weird adult store. Ayumi doesn't like it.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Teehee! He's always like this. Don't worry about it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((He always says creepy stuff?!))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((We're going to play teacher and student today, Ayumi.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((So in the beginning, you have to act shy and unsure. Then gradually start getting into it more and more, all right?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Okay.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hey! Have a little shame, you creep!))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Oh, hmph.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What do you mean, 「hmph」?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Aww, you look so unhappy, my dear Takuya.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I am unhappy! And don't take that tone with me.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Are you jealous?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?! Don't be stupid!))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Oh ho ho, I see. Your testosterone is taking over, huh? Attaboy.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((You two really are alike.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What makes you say that?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Ayumi, he's got the hots for this one woman, you know.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?!))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Oh, is that so?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Are you interested to know, as his stepmother?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Of course. What's she like, Takuya?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Well⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hey! It's not your place to say!))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((She must be a particularly dim girl for you to like her.))[%p]

[name]Koudai[line]((Yep. A boy that likes her is right under her nose, and she hasn't noticed.))[%p]

[name]Ayumi[line]((What are you talking about? I'm talking about Takuya's girlfriend.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((My girlfriend⋯ I-I don't have a girlfriend.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((But there's a girl you like, right?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((W-Well⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Okay then, we'll do a little teacher-student roleplay today.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((It will be a forbidden love affair between a female student and her teacher⋯plus the male student she's already in an illicit relationship with!))[%p]

[name]Koudai[line]((Hahaha! Too late! It's decided!))[%p]

[name]Ayumi[line]((Ahhhhhh!!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was nothing I could do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I could clearly see she was wracked with grief, but even then, Ayumi never cried in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even when she heard my father died, she spoke to me with a kind smile.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((We have to do our best together.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It never occurred to me that women could be this solemn.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There she was sitting in her room, wearing her black dress, and crying⋯and I couldn't do anything to comfort her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When I saw her, I retreated to my own room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I buried my head in the covers and tried to hide from the truth.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was such an idiot.)[%p]

[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi just smiled and forgave me for all of it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always⋯)
[name]Ayumi[line]((All I hope is that you take the path that's best for you, Takuya.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((That's all.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's all that noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! I'm tired![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no! Did I fall asleep?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone! Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That clock resets every day. It's supposed to be accurate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man bought that clock in some random country.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That crappy clock loses a few minutes every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I leave through there, I'll fall onto the roof of the house next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They'll think I'm a burglar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The roof of the house next door is just below here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The window to the right leads straight to the front of my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wallpaper that looks like wood paneling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoever decorated must like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only wall with wood paneling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wallpaper that looks like wood paneling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Naturally, it's fake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it was real, it would be worth more than this house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to be by some famous artist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it Honet, or Konet, or Kinet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it! Monet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like sitting right now. I'm just looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the chair I prefer to sit in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's got five legs for a reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you lean way back, you won't fall over. With only four legs, you'd topple right onto the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's papers are in there, including a detailed description of how to use the Reflector.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I read it?[%p]
Read the documents
Don't read the documents
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I don't feel like reading now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll give it a read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just skim the important parts.[%p]

[margin top="32"][color index="A01D0000"]How to Use the Jewels:[color index="880000"] The Jewels record the current place and time. You can change the control method with the :btnR1:. Using a Jewel will cause it to react and temporarily disappear from the Reflector.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]Once the Jewel is used, it will continue to exist in that area until the person possessing the Reflector returned to that worldline.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]A save made using a Jewel will be called a Jewel Save. Once you make a Jewel Save, you can load it from the map.[color index="800000"][%e]
[color index="880000"]The Jewel symbols on the map are places where Jewel Saves were made. Selecting them from the map and pressing the :btnA: will allow you to instantly move to that place.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]The benefit of Jewel Saves is that you can continue with all of your items and Jewels from the time of the save.[color index="800000"][%e]
[color index="A01D0000"]How to Use the Map(A.D.M.S.):[color index="880000"] Press the :btnY:, and the parallel worlds map will be displayed.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]The horizontal axis of this map shows time, displaying roughly 50 hours of the world. The map will record details of each world, even those you have only visited once.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]Each time you find a new junction point, a sound effect (SE) will play, and each path you take will be added.[color index="800000"][%e]
[color index="880000"]The bouncing red circle shows your current position. The shining stars indicate places with Jewels you haven't found yet.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]Thoroughly search locations with a shining star, and eventually, you will find a Jewel somewhere in that place and time.[color index="800000"][%e]

[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]That means there is a world junction point somewhere nearby. This is a somewhat difficult means of determining the timing of a junction on the map.[color index="800000"][%p]
[margin top="32"][color index="880000"]By paying attention to this, you will learn the timing of the junction, and will be able to effectively search the parallel world.[color index="800000"][%e]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a more specialized manual. Should I read that, too?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's pretty long, so I'll read it later.[%p]
Hypothesis on the Structure of the Worlds: [linebreak]The concept of how the parallel worlds are comprised is no simple thing.[%p]
Until now, I have postulated the six theories: Simple Parallel Model, Parallel-Direct Model, Pyramid Model, Klein Bottle Model, Dispersion Network Model, and Es Model. I plan to use the most credible of these, the Pyramid Model, to strengthen my Reflector hypothesis.[%e]
This system can define three worlds in contrast with this world.[%p]
The first is the original world which constructed this world.[%p]
The second is a parallel world with the same possibilities of existence as this world.[%p]
And finally, there is the subordinate world, which is based on this world. Its existence is shaped by the possible diverging existences (divergent fates) of choices made in this world.[%p]
Those are the three possible worlds.[%e]
The worlds whose forms are derived from actions taken in this world are all subordinate worlds, commonly called parallel worlds. They are worlds subordinate to and existing parallel to this world.[%p]
Moving solely through subordinate worlds fits the Simple Parallel Model - Endless Room Fixed Model recorded in THE LEGACY, but movement from a subordinate world that affects this world (moving up a layer from a subordinate world) requires energy of one order higher when compared to moving down a layer.[%p]
Retracing an event requires a considerable amount of energy.[%e]
(1) Moving to an Upper Layer[%p]
When moving from a subordinate world (i + 1 Layer) to this world (i Layer), one will no longer be in the subordinate world. This means the subordinate world you were in disappears, so the movement requires enough energy to create all i + 1 Layer subordinate world forms.[%p]
[margin top="38"](2) Moving to a Lower Layer[%p]
This is equivalent to creating a new subordinate world out of this world. This movement requires enough energy to create one subordinate world.[%e]
E, the energy used to create the form of a subordinate world, can be defined by expanding on Einstein's theory of relativity (E=mc²), detailed below.[%p]
 E=ΣM (ρ, φ, Η, t) {C(ρ, φ)}²[linebreak]  M: Total volume of equivalent dimensional mass. [linebreak]  ρ: Phenomenal density (the probability density of phenomena in this world). [linebreak]  φ: Total phenomenon potential.[linebreak]  H: Total dimensional retention space.[linebreak]  t: Total dimensional retention time.[linebreak]  C: Total speed of phenomenal elements.[%e]
This form or energy E can be applied to the system of only this world.[%p]
In this instance, when the phenomenal density/phenomenon potential are reached and they are assumed to be constant,[linebreak][margin top="38"] C ([ ], [ ]) =c (speed)[linebreak][margin top="38"] M ([ ], [ ], H, t) =m (object mass).[%p]
[margin top="38"]Then, E=mc² holds up. The fact that the speed of light cannot be surpassed is the largest law of causality in this world.[%e]
Think of the infinite individual bodies of energy that exist parallel to us and move along with the flow of causality as Phenomena. Next, think of each of their histories as worlds. The integration of the two is what makes parallel worlds.[%p]
One could say that all of us exist upon these parallel worlds.[%e]
Reflector Operation Principles[%p]
To explain the Reflector Operation Principals, I must assume the existence of particles called Phenomenal Elements. But what are these Phenomenal Elements?[%p]
I define them as particles that exist in 「imaginary」 space, and I postulate that they are anti-photons, similar to the photons in the 「real」 space that we live in.[%p]
These phenomenal elements radiate from the Reflector along with the target phenomenon's individual phenomena spectrum. The target phenomena return to the Reflector once the phenomenal element radiation waves resonate with the phenomenon spectrum.[%e]
Waves given off by the Reflector are interrupted by the radiation of the target fixation, forming the nodes and antinodes of the phenomenal element waves, Phenomenal Density Waves.[%p]
The node is the smallest part of phenomenal density waves. [linebreak]   This signifies a world with a low possibility of existence. [linebreak]The antinode is the largest part of phenomenal density waves.[linebreak]   This signifies a world with a high possibility of existence.[%p]
If you can control the interference of phenomenal density waves and set the node to this world (reality) and the antinode to the target phenomenon (next parallel world), then the flow of causality, which moves most easily from reality to the target phenomenon, will be formed in the target space.[%e]
Once an unstable system is formed from this phenomenal density, you must orient the causality energy to the target phenomenon.[%p]
[margin top="38"]By creating this event shock, the system's instability makes a Phenomenon Leap Fold, linking our world to the target phenomenon, instantly transporting us from our world to there.[%p]
I plan to more strictly define this phenomenal density to increase the credibility of this hypothesis.[%e]
Definition of Phenomenal Density[%p]
The measurement device inside the Reflector releases particles called phenomenal elements at speed V and records their return as they are reflected off of the target object at speed v. [linebreak]  1/2m (V - v)² (where m is the phenomenon equivalent mass).[%p]
It then measures the causality energy absorbed to the target and determines the causality energy absorption function. The causality energy absorption function mentioned here refers to the target's function determined by its phenomenal density and phenomenal elements.[%e]
In addition, this Causality Energy absorption Function includes time change based on t, which is broken down by phenomenal spectral conversion. The spectral value is basically the target spectrum (the frequency of possible events), and is defined as the phenomenal density being sought.[%p]
However, in actual parallel worlds, there are countless possible existences, so the Reflector should thoroughly adjust and update the measured phenomenon's spectrum value and select the phenomenal density of the target phenomenon based on Darwin's theory of natural selection.[%e]
There is also a limit to the Reflector's operation. One cannot move freely to any world they choose. If a world approaches the event horizon (1/ρ) when that world's phenomenal density (ρ) is extremely high, there will be no way to evade it.[%p]
This event horizon is called the Schwarzschild Phenomenon Radius, and I will henceforth refer to these unavoidable situations as fate.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure if I understood that explanation or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Basically, this Reflector has an unusual function.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've opened it so many times, but there's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't remember putting this in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Looking at it over and over again won't make it appear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never put anything in the desk on principle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to study. If there's nothing else to do, then I guess I'll exercise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the desk I sit at to read comics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never studied at this desk. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably just another prank call.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's not look at it anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The moment I looked at the phone, it rang.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, could it be Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello, this is⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Another prank call. I've been getting a lot of those lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, it wasn't Ayumi. I'm hanging up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to hang it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cordless extension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one in the living room, one in Ayumi's room, and one in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where the main phone is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that I won't study. It's that I can't study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just believe me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not much room on the desk. But it doesn't matter, because I'm not going to study anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are books, an MD player, pencils, that kind of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever I put in here gets lost. It's like a black hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Make sure you think before you use an item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously. Everything that goes in there disappears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. It's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, my lovely honeys. Away with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. It was right here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had Yuuki mail order it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I put it with my other valuables.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see what we can find here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? It's pitch black.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a useless table lamp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lamp didn't do anything wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a table lamp that provides light, so my eyes don't go bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I've never used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty useless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to go a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whether I go to the living room or stay here, I don't think it would change much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I'll stay here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't leave the house right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get down to my front door from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I shouldn't do that now. It would be bad if I went out and missed Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My private room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around my room isn't going to get anything done.[%p]
