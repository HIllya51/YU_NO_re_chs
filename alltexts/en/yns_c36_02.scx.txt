[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just put this back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the sound of someone putting a card in the door mechanism.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's coming?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'll just hide behind that big desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, I dropped some papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it, I can't go back and get them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could be coming here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it might be Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it is, I feel like I don't have to hide⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nope, no way. Even if it is Ayumi, I still broke in here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And if it isn't Ayumi, it'll be trouble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hmph, looks like nobody's here. But the occupied sign was green⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]They're gone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, that voice.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]They're not here. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's he doing in Ayumi's office?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like he's looking for something.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]I know the documents were supposed to be in here⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]If they aren't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Documents?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does he mean what I have in my hand?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They were what Ayumi was holding so closely⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does Toyotomi want with them?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then again, he is Ayumi's subordinate⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It wouldn't be strange for him to come to her office to grab some documents.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯something seems off.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Could she have done it herself? No, I would've heard about it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Which means, it's time for the contingency plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he talking about?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Hmm, what's this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He saw the papers I dropped!)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Ah, the documents⋯but why are they on the ground?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]I see, looks like the contingency plan has already begun⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Now it makes sense that the light was green.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. Now he notices the details.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Come out. I don't know who you are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]And I don't know where you're hiding, but I'll call security if you don't come out.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Which means you'll be placed under arrest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. If he calls security, I'm screwed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it'd be the same if I went out there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, hold on⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why hasn't Toyotomi called security yet?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If there's an unknown intruder in the room⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ordinarily, you would immediately call security.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he talking to an unknown intruder?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be a reason Toyotomi can't call security.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Hmph, the silent treatment, huh? You really want me to call them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll get caught no matter what I do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that's the case⋯ Maybe it's time for a gamble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi, Mr. Porn Director.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, it was you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now comes the crucial moment.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't I remember something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The missing page, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page is missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page⋯ Didn't I see it somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a thin booklet. It's probably around 20 pages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]1, 2, 3, 4⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯18, 19, 21, 22⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page is missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page⋯ The 20th page?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a drawer. I wonder what's inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I recognize these documents⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earlier, Ayumi was carrying them in front of Geo Technics⋯
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I helped her pick up the pages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right. Ayumi couldn't find one page⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「SP Stone, Optical Resolution Report」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of strange numbers and graphs written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's it supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't understand any of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look into this more⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a machine that draws up plans⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a machine that makes drafts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what Ayumi uses to draw up plans?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she uses all these machines by herself⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's gotta be a reason for having two different kinds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of machines on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't fully utilize a CAD system with just a computer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what Ayumi always says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something smells good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be Ayumi's chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's nice and fragrant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be Ayumi's desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's another one over there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi uses this desk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must do a lot of work on here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it blows comfortable air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A ceiling AC unit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, AC is short for air conditioner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A ceiling light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if it's sunny outside, the inside of this room is pretty dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that's why the light's on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a teapot. I'm not thirsty now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could use the items around here to pass the time drinking tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi put her lips on any of these cups⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she read magazines over here during her breaks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desk is probably for breaks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a teapot and some other stuff here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chair looks rather uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This chair doesn't look very comfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no knob, so it must be an automatic door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi and Toyotomi are in here during the day⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like anyone's inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the construction site near the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky, the trees, and the ocean are all out there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is the perfect work environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the room isn't going to get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at this won't make Ayumi appear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, where the hell did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't there⋯[%p]
