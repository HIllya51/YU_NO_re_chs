[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'm inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is happening to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯ My head is throbbing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'm in the school hall, and it's probably still daytime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's obviously still daytime, but I wonder what day it is exactly⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm? That person coming out of the infirmary⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why were you at the infirmary? Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yeah⋯ I wasn't feeling very well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ms. Eriko in there right now?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]She is. Now, if you'll excuse me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's a shy one⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew someone that switched out all their lights to this type because it was stylish at the time⋯ How dumb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These things are just going to make your eyesight worse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called indirect lighting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a type of bulb that uses covers or something to soften the light instead of using direct illumination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Now that I think about it, plants go through photosynthesis during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So there should actually be more oxygen in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be the culprit⋯ Plants breathe in oxygen, so there has to be a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It does feel a bit hard to breathe in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, the school physician, must be the only one that uses it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Yeah. I have a feeling I'm right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there an ash tray in the school hall? One of the many mysteries here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Maybe it's for guests?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some sofas arranged in a circle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be one of those 「objects.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's basically just a fancy way to say 「object.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that weird thing dangling from the ceiling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say it was made using the sun as a motif⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big painting⋯ I wonder who the artist is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking back, no one told me when I first enrolled here. All I know is that the patterns were themed around the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard that skylight slides open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how it opens⋯? Maybe it's automatic?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A skylight⋯ Sunlight comes in from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that's why it's nice and bright in here.[%p]
「This notice board displays your current coordinates. You are currently at the coordinates listed.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more⋯[%p]
「There are other locations for you to find that display the 『current completion rate.』 Take a look at those alongside the notice boards.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there's something new posted on this thing⋯[%p]
「This notice board displays your current map coordinates.」[%p]
「You are currently at these coordinates.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯What is it talking about? I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Today is the second day⋯ It's around noon of day two.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]The sun has risen twice since this chapter started.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Well, if you disregard the first night, you could say this is the second day⋯ So around noon of day two.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]You just came to school after going to bed in your room.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh⋯? What do I mean by 「day two」?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Who knows⋯ Ahaha, I'm not sure what I'm talking about either.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]This is the school hall, and it's daytime right now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]This is the school hall.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It's daytime right now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You already know that? Then you didn't really need to ask⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I should assess the situation first⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I already told you.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]This is Kamchatka–Hey! Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What? You want to know where you are and what day it is?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Then allow me to tell you: you're south of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the year 1000 B.C.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What? You don't believe me?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, so you already know. Then why did you ask me in the first place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess they don't know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Wait, don't know what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I guess I'll go ahead and ask⋯ Hey![%p]
[name]Student[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯ I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You would think they would be busier with club activities or something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they're all taking remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, we meet again. It's been a while.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well, do I have a juicy story for you. It's a long one though.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Still want to hear it?[%p]
[name]Student[line]This might take a little while⋯ Want to hear it again?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]Okay, then I'll tell you.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Somewhere in this world, there's a special gate⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]In other words, it's a path to another place, another time⋯ A warp zone, if you will.[%p]
[name]Student[line]There are certain locations that can't be accessed without using them, so keep that in mind.[%p]
[name]Student[line]And don't panic even if you find yourself warped to an unusual place or time period.[%p]
[name]Student[line]With that, I'll see you again in another world⋯and I'll give you another hint then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I see⋯[%p]

[name]Student[line]With that, I'll see you again in another world⋯and I'll give you another hint then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]When you don't know where to go, just look at the map.[%p]
[name]Student[line]What? You want to know what to do if you run out of Jewels?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yeah, that may be tough because you wouldn't be able to open the map anymore.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well, in that case, you'll just have to explore the world without relying on the map. I'm sure you'll find one eventually.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Good luck! Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]This is how I recover from all the fatigue of remedial classes and club activities.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Please try not to bother me.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Well, excuse me, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No point in looking at it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I may not know everything about the school, but I'd say I know just enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's directory⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hall, infirmary, and office are all on the first floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our classrooms are on the second floor and above.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I would love to touch it, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Now probably isn't the time for that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring blankly at the school hall isn't going to accomplish anything⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What to do⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, I'll go to the infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going up to the second floor⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I think I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Wait a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to confirm the situation. Let's go talk to someone.[%p]
