[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why did I come here⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you have such a strong interest in the mountain?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you really want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm getting a strong sense that I'm in danger.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's my instincts giving me a warning sign.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's a cigar. Care for one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I can never quit cigars. Addicted since my first one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I've heard that line before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't smoke until recently?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was in a place where I didn't need to smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Back to the topic. It is my understanding that a secret lies within this mountain⋯no, within the town of Sakaimachi itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A secret?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of secret?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Your father figured that secret out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man did?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is strange⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't stand⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's wrong? You're sweating quite profusely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's wrong.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]This world is not something sole and unique. Koudai knew that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I know you have something that he entrusted to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Something that will allow you to pass the Neumann boundary condition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What⋯ What's happening?!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, still standing? Perhaps the Niarb hypnosis isn't working on you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What did he leave you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't⋯know anything.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You really don't know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You took the Jewel that was here earlier, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was watching your every move from the shadows. That's how I knew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's something that cannot even exist here. And you went and picked it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is he saying I was careless?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the same as that night.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's wrong⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, hand over what you have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit, I'm going to⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My vision⋯is darkening.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What is the meaning of this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something Ryuuzouji didn't plan on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then could it be⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No⋯ Could this be chaos correction?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Chaos⋯what now?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. That makes everything so clear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯does?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I now know without a doubt, you have a factor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My vision⋯is darkening.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh, don't forget this. When you come back to this world, at this hour again–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I⋯come back?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. I'll be taking your factor upon your return. I shall remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's⋯happening?[%p]
⋯ma⋯[%p]
⋯rima⋯[%p]
Arima⋯wake up.[%p]
Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was someone calling me?[%p]
Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Listen to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That man, he smells different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That man? You mean Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please be careful, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With who? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You'll be brought back to that time. That is chaos correction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Chaos⋯correction?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There is nothing I can do for you, but please believe him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Believe who?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man? What do you know about my old man?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Believe him⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait. I still want to ask you something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to ask about you![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My head hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My cheeks, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stings⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi pinching me again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She always pinches me when she's trying to wake me up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold. I wonder why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a bed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, this is where I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, how about these the Twin Boulders?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something wrong with these rocks?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]According to the textbook's interpretation, it was nature's doing. You know, the way they're so perfectly aligned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you know how these came to be proven as naturally formed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]They used radiation detection on some ore found in the rocks and measured its approximate age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it can tell us when the rock was made?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. According to the measurement, it's about 8,000 years old. That's why they say it wasn't man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you know what that implies?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, for the most part.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Go ahead and tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It means that humanity was barely surviving 8,000 years ago, let alone its development of culture.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back then, nothing was artificial, so this thing couldn't have been man-made. Something like that?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Exactly. As a scientific theory, it's nothing short of fantastic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Humans didn't evolve from monkeys, or so they reason by saying if mankind was made by God, they could not have evolved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Very scientific.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph, you've got a good sense of humor, just like Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Back to the topic. Indeed, the letters chiseled on the polished surface of the rock to the left are man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, they say people carved them long after these rocks got here.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Yet there is no evidence for that either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean to argue against you, but can I say something?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't the study of history itself just the repetition of facts to prove it happened? There's no actual proof for what happened in the past.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The amount of people who actually experienced any event naturally decrease over time until they're all gone. All that's left are written records and legends.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. You sure are Koudai's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would he say that to me?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't have much interest in the accident. I'm only interested in the Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What do you think of the Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm asking you what you think about this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I think about Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. I see. It's commonly referred to as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What on earth is he saying?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Triangle Mountain is Triangle Mountain, right⋯?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Its proper name is 「Sword Cape.」 The ocean breeze and time itself carved the rocks to a pointed tip. That's what the textbooks say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I remember that.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]However, there's no proof that the simple sea breeze could mold a mountain into a shape like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plenty of other mountains that look just like this though.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, that's true. It might just be my imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's wrong⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ I'm just feeling a little dizzy.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That isn't good. Would you like to take a seat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What on earth is going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And here I thought the only good thing about me was my health.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing in a place like this?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ichijou is over at Geo Technics right now, so I guess you could say I'm just killing time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is at Geo Technics?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I should be asking you the same question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell him I followed him here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this is what you call being at a loss for an answer.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There have been a lot of accidents on the coastline. You'll want to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, they call them accidents, but they could have been something other than a natural disaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm starting to get a bad feeling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My instincts are telling me danger is near. What could be going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What an inorganic expression.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way to tell what he's thinking based on his expression.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's middle-aged but keeps up with the fashion trend.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe that's Mitsuki's style.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His hair all dressed and done up nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I be staring at his tie right now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His necktie isn't too flashy, and has a nice pattern.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Speaking of smoking reminds me of Ms. Eriko.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji smokes too, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a big, fat caterpillar, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's a cigar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sometimes it's very hard to understand you. Just like your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's built like a tree trunk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's built like a tree trunk. Looks older but I doubt I'd win against him in martial arts.)[%p]
