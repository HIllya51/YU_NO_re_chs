[name]Takuya[line]It's dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is still out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I stayed out late last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi is mad at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the anti-fever medicine now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the super powerful anti-fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I bring this over⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I heard something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, it kind of sounds like a weird siren.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure it's my imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry to where I need to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and do what I have to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That thing I have to do⋯ I know what it is, don't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi already back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand, but that's what's written.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」 is what it says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some more writing⋯[%p]
「There are also other places where your 『Current Coordinates』 are noted, so please reference that as well.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sign. What does it say?[%p]
「This sign displays your current completion rate.」[%p]
「Your current junction discovery rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As much as humans destroy nature to put up man-made structures, they can't get away from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a strange connection we have with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants in my house, as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sexy fliers inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it would matter if there were. It'd just make me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, are there any fliers for video deliveries?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh! This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electricity bill. We have been using the AC lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the gate. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a gated entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tiled wall. It's not made of bricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall that surrounds the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why do Japanese people want to surround everything with walls?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The spaces are small enough as they are, but everyone puts up walls. Making it even smaller.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna clean it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room's window is on the left, the right one is my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They might start getting dirty if we don't clean them soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A normal antenna. The TV signal isn't bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We need a satellite dish to get satellite TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The antenna for the local channels. It's still the age of analog broadcasting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect 「upper middle class」 house imagined by us middle class people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house where Ayumi and I live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dark night sky. Like it'll swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't waste time staring into space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A clear blue sky with nice sunshine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, not a bad day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. There's not many people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. Probably because the ocean is relatively close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the city in the distance. It's the only busy downtown area in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going back downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, am I going back downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, is it okay to go to the coastline now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I guess I'll just have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sea at night. It must be quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, now I really want to see the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just left my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house? That doesn't sound very exciting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going inside the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, Ayumi might be back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I ask her what's going on, I might be able to find something out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I have what I need.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if I get that anti-fever medicine from my house, maybe Kanna's fever would go down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, back to the living room![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, Ayumi could be home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try going back to the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go back to the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school, huh? Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, I'm heading to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will ringing my own door bell accomplish?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going in the house, I should just walk in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No more.[%p]

*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you happy now?[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it again for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it for no reason.[%p]
