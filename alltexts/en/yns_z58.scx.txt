[name]Takuya[line](Everywhere I look, it's still the desert⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was smart to leave at night. It's only half the effort as it would have been during the day.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aren't we a little off trying to go this way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, this is fine.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look so worried. It's going to be fine. We're just taking a little detour.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]To that temple Sala was talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm? Yeah.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Is everything okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think so.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, let's head over there. She may have given us some rations, but they won't last forever.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that look for?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I had such a weird dream last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A dream⋯?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, tell me about it some other time. Let's move on ahead for now.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temple⋯)
[name]Sala[line]((You're going to the temple?))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((I wouldn't if I were you.))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((Once you step foot inside, the Royal Guards will be all over you like a swarm of bees.))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((You might get killed before you get a chance to punch the God-Monarch.))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((Why? What's in the temple?))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((Well, honestly I don't really know for sure⋯))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((But I've heard there's a sacred relic inside.))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((They say it's used in holy rituals.))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((It could be that ritual to make God descend, the job your little priestess was all about, right?))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((What kind of relic? How should I know?))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((I'm just telling you what I heard.))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((Hey, are you really going over there?))[%p]
[name]Sala[line]((Oh well, don't come crying to me when it's over. I don't care what happens to you⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A relic⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A vessel of God, in other words.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said it's used in a holy ritual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what will it do?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it, Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I can see something over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You see something?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be the temple?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's be very careful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. Just don't stray too far from me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could this be⋯)[%p]
