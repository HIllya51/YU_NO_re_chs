[name]Takuya[line](This looks more serious than I thought.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, look at all those papers.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, unfortunately⋯ What I'm concerned with isn't strictly about an era. I just want to know the origin of Triangle Mountain and what really happened in the past.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's resistance because that inscription is said to be indecipherable. However, I think it's actually a simple missive about how to obtain a certain key.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And that tapestry I saw at Headmaster Ryuuzouji's house⋯ I think that's a clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tapes-what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The tapestry. It's a piece of art that's like a rug used for decoration.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So how is that a clue?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The problem is the placement of the Twin Boulders⋯ It's too similar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Too similar?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Anyway, I have a copy of the symbols on the inscription drawn here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A notebook?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes. Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh? What's this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's all rubbed off and I can't see it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]L-Listen, I had nothing to do with that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What should I do? I guess I shouldn't have written in pencil.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's your fault for using pencil.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough* Can't you just copy it again? Isn't that what you did in the first place?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, you're right. Okay then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I was gonna go there tonight, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alone, at night?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't like the way you say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm going to Sword Cape. There's something I want to check.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you just go during the day?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't. There are too many people during the day. I want to do my research in peace. And there isn't time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just have to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right now?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Have you heard of the saying, 「the early bird gets the worm」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's also 「everything comes to those who wait.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I support the former. I don't want to waste a single second. I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course there's no need for you to come⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't let you go alone to Triangle Mountain in the dark, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-Thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to thank me. I'm interested in your theory, too. It's give and take.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, that's fine. Well then⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, was that a knock?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Are you in there, Mio?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-It's my dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your dad? You sure it isn't your sugar daddy?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course not, stupid![%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((You're in there, aren't you Mio? Can I come in?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]O-Oh no⋯ H-Hurry up and get out the window![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want to me go out the window? Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If my dad finds you, it's all over. Hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean it's all over?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Well, if he finds a boy in my room⋯ Takuya, my dad will kill you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]He's weirdly strict and proper like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Mio, is someone there? You're not answering, so I'm coming in.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Wait! I'm changing now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not changing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you doing? Hurry, get out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, why would you say that? I'm not your Romeo or anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Romeo or bromeo, if my dad comes in here, you're dead, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, that's ridiculous⋯ Hey⋯hey⋯ Don't push⋯ Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch⋯ She pushed me out the window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with her? Unbelievable. Ow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your shoes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shoes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh⋯ If you leave these in my room, we'll get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the big idea pushing me out of the window like that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't have time to talk. Go to Sword Cape and wait for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait for me she says⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Oh, Dad. What is it? Do you need something from my room?))[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((I don't need anything, but⋯ Just making sure you weren't gathering any flies in here, Mio.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Hahaha⋯ I-I'm fine, Dad. See? No flies.))[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Hmm⋯ Well, if there was anyone in here trying to put their filthy paws on my little Mio, I'd fill them full of holes with the shotgun from the parlor.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are you kidding me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh, it's cold out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Aaaachoo![%p]
[name]Mio[line]((*gasp*))[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((What was that voice?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((I-I wonder⋯ Maybe it was just a wild boar outside.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I'm just unlucky.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should leave⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Geez, this is just crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should try going to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm supposed to meet Mio there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've investigated some things about Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The theory is that the Twin Boulders themselves are natural, but the writing set into them is man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone probably carved an inscription into it a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, it was roughly 400 years ago. But for what purpose?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Think about it a little, will you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, things we believe to have value now wouldn't have any meaning to medieval people, would they? It must have been valuable to their culture at the time.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's where the thinking stops. However, even though it was 400 years ago, it was carved by humans, meaning we should still be able to understand it using logic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want to reason it out?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me hear it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That inscription is not trying to say something with words. It's depicting a certain symbol.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A symbol?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, we would call it a code in modern terms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, this was 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're saying they couldn't have codes 400 years ago?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that they couldn't, but I just don't wanna be fooled.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The reason I'm skeptical about my old man⋯no, about ancient history, is because the dating is just too imprecise.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not true. We have the era written down in literature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the theory is based on that era, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's outrageous.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Can you refute it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can refute it all day. For example, I could say something about the timeline.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯ Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If your theory needs to be based on a precise timeline, then you shouldn't use a Western calendar.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take the leap year, for example.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What, that thing that happens every four years?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Every four years there's a leap year, and that year has 366 days. Do you know who made that system?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is that a history question? Too bad for you, I know this one. It was Julius Caesar. 46 B.C.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. I shouldn't have expected anything less from a straight-A student.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's why they call it the Julian calendar. But why does that contradict the timeline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think about it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I mean, it's made to compensate for lost time. That's how we can measure time more precisely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, even though we add a day every four years, time is still slightly off.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was the year 1582. There was a big problem with a certain religion. Because one year was off, the spring solstice came 10 days early.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]10 whole days?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess even straight-A students don't know some things.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know why it was a problem that the spring solstice came 10 days early?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It has to do with Christianity, right? Easter is based around the time of the spring solstice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Exactly. That's why some high ranking guy, on October 15th, 1582, pushed the calendar forward a whole 10 days.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That seems a little brash.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks to that, everything balanced out. So, that's how they came up with the modern leap year.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The modern leap year?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me the current definition of a leap year.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A leap year is⋯well, every 4 years we add 1 day to the calendar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wrong.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the year is divisible by 4, then it's a leap year. But there's an exception. When the year is divisible by 100, it's a normal year.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, there's another exception to that. If it's divisible by 100, it's not a leap year, but when it's divisible by 400, it is.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means we can accurately follow time back to October 15th, 1582. Before that, time deviates more and more.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, there are parts that I'm okay with⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just parts?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. That group of whatcha call its.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The Celestials.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. According to your theory, the Celestials are somehow related to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, we'll skip through the details but I agree there's something up with Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, do you think there was some lady with golden hair as part of the Celestials?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A lady with golden hair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, a lady with golden hair.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are guys always like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you mean by that, I'm talking about a naked lady with golden hair.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you look so mad?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can never be satisfied, can you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't think there's any golden haired Celestials⋯ I'm pretty sure the Celestials are of pure Asian lineage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahem. So, why do you think there's something up with Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't dig my nose into research documents like you do, but I just have a feeling there's something there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Like intuition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, something like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph, intuitive scholastics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha, I bet real scholars would turn in their graves hearing that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I like it. Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think about this all the time. It's almost always the case that theories are made from inspiration, not rationale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is finally starting to think like my old man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The secret of Triangle Mountain⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Try remembering the Twin Boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Twin Boulders? You mean those things on your chest?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm talking about the two big rocks at Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]In every history book I've read, those rocks are described as a product of chance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So maybe it's coincidence?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Given the way they were placed, I think it was on purpose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could they be put there on purpose?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, I think it's fine to challenge modern theories, but where's your proof?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you know why the Twin Boulders were dismissed as potential artifacts?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I don't.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They used radioactive dating on some ore from the boulders and measured its approximate age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it can tell us when the rock was made?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. According to the measurement, it's about 8,000 years old. That's why they say it wasn't man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you know what that implies?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, for the most part.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Human culture was barely around 8,000 years ago.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back then, nothing was artificial, so this thing couldn't have been man-made. Something like that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, that's exactly it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that a reasonable interpretation?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's reasonable about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't get so angry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I want to hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just one way to interpret it. I'm not wrong, am I?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not very scientific to recognize existing concepts a priori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, could you please speak English?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You can't have scientific development without refuting previous theories. Unchanging theories are complete nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* It feels like I'm talking with my old man.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because I pored through everything I could get my hands on to figure this out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I admire that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]In 「Legacy」 it's written that the secret of the Celestials rests in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They didn't mention any particular place. But following the tone of the research, one place starts to stand out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm pretty sure the secret is at Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What, are you refuting my claim?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well no, but I can't affirm it either.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of people have tried to answer this stuff before you came along.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some people say the boulders are an ancient grave, or communication markers for aliens, you know?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I draw the line at unknown plebeian theories like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unknown plebeian theories?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Here, look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's about the Twin Boulders.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, where are you looking at?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the papers of course.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Don't try anything funny![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, I'm looking at the papers.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I hope so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks pretty serious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I joke around, she'll probably kick my ass.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not what I meant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't even say anything yet⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those curls aren't bed hair.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not what I meant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is it so curly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be bed hair.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course it isn't. You're so stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what is it, shit on a stick?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The look in your eyes says you'd like to kill me and my whole family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't be the only one that wants to go around and see this from another angle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to smack my wide open palm on it, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Uh oh⋯ Mio is glaring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's big, round ass⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, could you not say that please?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then I'll call it a nice, soft ass.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, I'll just call it a huge ass.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm gonna kick you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tits⋯ How about that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How about what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm talking about breasts. Not the chicken kind, either.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So what about them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Jugs![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Jugs are something you put liquid in, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you doing this on purpose?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Doing what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just trying to say, aren't they big?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, I never intended for them to get this big⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with the strange look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What're we talking about again?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Uh, this theory I've been researching? How big my theory has grown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just wondering about your⋯number.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, I'm 18.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, that's it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I have no reason to lie about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're definitely not 18. You have to be at least 32.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ew, I'm not that old.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An old woman would not look like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't think we're talking about the same thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's hand. Her elbows are on the floor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's leaning down with her hands on the floor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's comparing a bunch of different documents.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I'll get the hiccups just looking at her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's going to notice me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not wearing any shoes⋯*gulp*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What was that sound you just made?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a hiccup. *hic⋯hic*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're so weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio has some documents lined up on the floor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tea.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ My vocabulary level is getting worse and worse.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gimme some tea, eh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, but I'm not even thirsty. How about you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of moron?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. You put tea in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You pour it in and drink it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, I'm not thirsty right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how far I crane my neck, I won't get a better view.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you poking your head around like a chicken?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A glass window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if you can see the reflection of Mio's ass in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cushion. Or should I say, a cushy for your tushy![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Quit joking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the pillow Mio drools on every night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ohh, is there a stain here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, of course there isn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*flump*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, don't do that! I always hold that when I go to bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]J-Just kidding. I would never do something so childish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you getting so nervous for?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you actually looking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How long has she been researching this for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is a serious investigation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe she looked into this much information.)[%p]
