[name]Takuya[line]People are gathering over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear a lot of chatter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's all the noise for? What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I saw this in my dream, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I saw this in my dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that's not what's causing all this dust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ All those people gathering over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're kicking something. What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that⋯?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Thanks to this guy, work's been heavily delayed.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm not satisfied unless I do this![%p]
[name]Worker[line]Take this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that creature? It looks like a lizard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems so familiar⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't know any lizards.[%p]
[name]Small Animal[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen to that miserable cry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lizard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lizard⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A⋯lizard.
[name]Takuya[line]Ah!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that lizard⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kun-Kun?! Yu-No's pet?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was released in the forest behind our house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just stand here and do nothing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! Wait![%p]
[name]Workers[line]Who's there?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kun-Kun⋯ What's going on with that lizard?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What? You mean the Nogard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nogard?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah. Nogards are vermin that come in here and disrupt our work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's called a Nogard?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course it's got a name. Why didn't I think of that before? I must be the only one calling it a lizard.)[%p]
[name]Worker[line]If you can understand me, then get out of here, vermin![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by vermin?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This guy messes up the dirt we carry, steals our food, wanders around, and generally disturbs our work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That's why I want to roast and eat it. You want a bite?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're gonna eat that? No way![%p]
[name]Worker[line]Sure am! Nogards are delicious! Don't let their looks fool you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it⋯edible?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Are you really going to turn this down? It's not everyday we get meat around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What? Don't worry, you can have a bite. Let's skin it and strip the meat fast, before the warden comes around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. Stop![%p]
[name]Worker[line]What? Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That Nogard looks like a pet I used to have named Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hey, that's our food! Are you trying to steal our meal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. I could never eat Kun-Kun![%p]
[name]Worker[line]That's even worse! You'd ignore a feast that's sitting right in front of you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please, don't eat that thing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Why not? We have work to do. What is wrong with getting rid of this problem?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Now that we have, it's wasteful to toss it away. Besides, why would anyone complain about free food?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That creature is intelligent! Kun-Kun is my friend⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I knew you were strange, but I didn't think you were friends with your food. Ha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Do you have any idea what you eat everyday?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Worker[line]You know, the stew? It's the same kind of meat. No different than that lizard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯did you just say?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, it's not a lizard per se, but it's all animal meat. You eat that every day, but you can't eat the creature sitting right in front of you. Nonsense, if you ask me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]You're a hypocrite. You eat meat every day, but suddenly you don't when it's a 「friend.」 Isn't that right?[%p]
[name]Workers[line]Hahahah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Anyway, whatever you think, it's not my problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna make it your problem.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Are you trying to pick a fight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not at all. But I'm taking that lizard with me.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Like hell you are![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I am.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Do you understand a word I'm saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only thing I understand is that we aren't gonna agree about this.[%p]
[name]Workers[line]You meddling bastard![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on! Make a move![%p]
[name]Worker[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Humph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone left. I guess they don't have the guts to take me on.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You are way too bold. Heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Yet again, you were only thinking of yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh heh. You've sure got incredible strength and stamina. I wouldn't believe you worked yesterday if I hadn't seen it myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm immortal.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Ha! You said the same thing yesterday. Well, I wouldn't be surprised if that was true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I warned ya, if you caused trouble again, I'd toss you in solitary confinement.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Solitary?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I wonder how it feels to be stuck in solitary for three days, enduring extreme heat and unbearable cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Three days seems pretty horrifying, don't you think? Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh boy, a three-day vacation![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Let's see how well you handle your 「vacation」! Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's all right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That bastard of a warden can't kill me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm the best worker here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They can't ignore results. All they can do is bully me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Speaking of which⋯ I wonder if Kun-Kun escaped.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want Yu-No to see her again⋯)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Why don't I give you a tour of your new room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, a room this small might make it difficult to enjoy my time off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ventilation's not so great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now I see what they mean about the window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's designed like a skylight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a stone room with terrible ventilation and a huge skylight in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A clever design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]During the day, that skylight will get direct sun and ensure this place heats up like a greenhouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With such bad ventilation, it's going to feel like hell itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And with how cold it gets at night, I'll bet it's like hell frozen over once the sun's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's ideally designed to take advantage of the desert climate. I guess the warden has got some brains after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll be staying here for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard they only serve one chunk of bread a day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's better than nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's definitely better than being killed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I'm alive, I haven't lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I'm alive, there's hope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And as long as there is hope, there's still a chance⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A chance to punch that God-Monarch right in the face![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe there's even a chance to see Yu-No again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A chance to survive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Brr⋯*shiver*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*shiver* G-G-God damn it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's freezing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe how cold it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had no idea it'd get this cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be below freezing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to freeze to death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*wheeze wheeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. I can't feel my arms or legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened to Kun-Kun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she escaped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like even my breath is frozen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And this is only the first day⋯ I won't die![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to give that fat bastard of a warden the satisfaction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯hot⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This heat is crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd say it's scorching, but it's even worse than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm going to burst into flame.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be at least over a hundred degrees in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like I'm being boiled, like I could just melt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is no place for humans to live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha ha! Look at that! They really do give you one chunk of bread a day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's perfectly toasted, too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't much shelter from the sun shining through the skylight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I could, the temperature of the room is overwhelming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This cell is certainly well designed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So thirsty⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't lose. I won't lose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my only goal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I absolutely can't lose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be a 100 degree difference between day and night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at my fingertips.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They've turned dark red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Frostbite⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Brrrr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hungry⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I'm about to die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm about to die⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, I am not going to die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I refuse to die in a place like this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*wheeze wheeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My fingers hurt so much. They're completely frozen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once daytime comes, the sun will warm me back up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It burns, but the warmth feels good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope daytime comes soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might get a sunburn shaped just like that skylight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha ha ha! Maybe I'll start a new fashion trend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I stay still any longer, I'm going to look like grilled meat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am not that cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't suffer from frostbite anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am not cold but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My mind isn't working properly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sometimes I see Yu-No sitting right next to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it an illusion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. Everything will be all right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At least I can still recognize hallucinations as hallucinations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe, I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to eat something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My physical strength is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it all to hell!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll die before I give up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Even if I die, I won't give up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just laugh while I die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to spit in the warden's face even as I'm dying on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! That's my dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Since⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been here since⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How many days have I been here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh. How's it going? It's already been three days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for asking, fatso! All that bulk you've got is giving me plenty of shade![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]So, you've still got enough strength left to talk back to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am not tired at all! Hahaha![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Your body's clearly giving up on you, but I guess your mind hasn't quit yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I'll allow you to stand there and provide shade for me.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I suppose I should give you some water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Water?![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh heh. No better than a starving dog.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Ahh![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I'm only giving this to you because I'll get in trouble if you die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I have more?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I guess you've got more energy now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I brought you a buddy today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A buddy? I don't have any friends⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You were caught trespassing in the temple, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I forgot. That was such a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]What if I tell you the person who was pulling your strings is here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Pulling my strings?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I work alone. No one tells me what to do.)[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You should take care of her. She'll need her strength to survive the torture. Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Torture?)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]She's a tight-lipped woman, and there's a lot I want to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]For now, I'll leave her here. Heh heh heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tight-lipped?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pulling my strings?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this guy talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
*tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone is lying on the floor next to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be a way to get outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just have to keep my head down and look for an opportunity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have to be careful or I'll end up like the others⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Roasted alive by lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got to know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll dig more later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Digging's all right, but doesn't that bother you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is no time to work. Don't you want to know what's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no more dirt to carry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This always seems to happen when I'm not working.[%p]
