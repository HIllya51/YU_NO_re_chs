[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A telephone pole. It doesn't look like Mitsuki climbed up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A telephone pole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if Mitsuki went up like a summer cicada? Nah, forget it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it says 「Stop」 and 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Street signs. I don't think Mitsuki is hiding behind them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't in the bushes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she isn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could she be in the bushes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how much I look at it, it's still a guardrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A guardrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still a guardrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't a bird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will staring up at the power lines do for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, what if she were perched up on the power lines like a bird?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would never happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was so hot during the day, but now it's almost cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The asphalt is cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's hiding behind the wall. Or not, because she doesn't do dumb stuff like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She can't be inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, why would she need to go inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt it. You can't get in the school at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's set up with an automatic lock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could she be inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I just standing around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should do something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made a promise. I can't go back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was I imagining that figure I just saw?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did someone just walk by?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are my eyes playing tricks on me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm sure it was a person. They disappeared behind the wall of the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would she be acting so suspiciously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pointless going there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mitsuki said the phone call was from Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's still there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'll go check out Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, what if she leaves as I'm going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to do anything, I should stay around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stick around here if I'm going to look for Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to miss her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going inside again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I might have missed her by a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. What if Mitsuki is inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might be waiting for me in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, you want to go inside that bad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a look. It's locked at night, so it won't⋯
 huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a look. It's locked at night, so it won't⋯huh?
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock should be in place. This is weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An automatic lock is triggered at night.[%p]
