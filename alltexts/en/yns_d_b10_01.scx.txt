[name]Takuya[line]The path is forked.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Going down the path to the right leads to a dead end, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the left path is a dead end too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The right path leads to a dead end.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, there was a boulder blocking the path.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The left path led to a door.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It didn't seem like it would open at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should we go?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Let's be careful, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's damp here too, just like everywhere else.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe it's from the water dripping from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the dampness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be from the water dripping down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
