[name]Takuya[line]What am I still doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until a few days ago, I would come here, take a nap, and ponder as part of my daily routine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, Celes came to me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is the end of it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see what's going on at the house from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry, let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up the hill⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No should be in the forest⋯ I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a beautiful sight, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of trees, fields all around, and a desert that lies beyond all of that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It hasn't changed much since four years ago⋯ Maybe due to the fact that there are no seasons⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the only change that might have occurred in the environment was us picking the nuts on the trees and taking some fish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The forest⋯ Oh, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've told her so many times not to go walking alone near the forest, especially around the cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a lot of food. I feel heavy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oooooooof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was me, stretching out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhhh⋯ What a nice day out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bit of cloud cover, keeping the sunlight away in a delightful manner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This would be the perfect day for a nap⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯ She must be putting her to sleep now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*laugh* Never thought she could be so precious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or is it because⋯she's 「my」 child?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that's how it is for everyone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, it's about that baby, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stork came down and dropped off the baby⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, sounds like a lame parent who has no clue about sex education.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen and be amazed. That baby is my daughter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, what do you think now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes and I had a baby⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her name is Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because it sounds like, 「You know?」⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that too simple for a name? Ahhaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We could have chosen Hanako or Kaori, or something along those lines.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But when I said this name, Celes smiled. That's why I chose it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ Yu-No is my child with Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be so dumbfounded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm also amazed at myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think about it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not trying to make an excuse, but if you have a healthy man and a woman in the middle of the woods, with no one around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's bound to happen, unless one of you has a problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And we did not have any problems.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is not how I pictured myself becoming a parent⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯it's been⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be approximately a year since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no clocks nor calendars here to keep time. So I'd say about a year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to my senses, I would say that it takes about 24 hours for the sun to rise and come back up the next morning⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means time passes the same way as where I come from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]24 hours makes a day, and 365 days makes a year⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that's why I thought it must be a year since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ It's been a year⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just to clarify, I have not been fooling around this whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've tried my hardest to find a way to get back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But nothing seemed to work, and I couldn't find a single trace of light⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, I've learned a few things while living here the past year⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This world⋯ Yes, there is no other way to describe it than 「this world.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This world is totally different from the world I come from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Observing those facts while napping at the top of the hill is my daily routine now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the top of the hill⋯ What am I doing here, going back and forth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house is right there, in front of my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've come to the top of the hill⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wish I could stay here and take a nap as usual⋯but first, I should take these nuts back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house is right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is so good and I can see so far, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sign of Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've made it to the top of the hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Celes⋯anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even when the view is so good and I can see so far⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A good view, hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quite a sight, as always⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This forest, the green⋯and the desert beyond it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this really not a part of the world I used to live in⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
