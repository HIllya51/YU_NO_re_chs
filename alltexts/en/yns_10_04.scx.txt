[name]Takuya[line]The AV room is closed even on weekdays. It's impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's closed. Looks like it's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, there's no need to open it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like painting supplies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Has nothing to do with me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go in in here, I can go down to the second floor.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]It's the school rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school rooftop.[%p]
