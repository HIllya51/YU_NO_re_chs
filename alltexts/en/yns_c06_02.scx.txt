[name]Takuya[line](Mio is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to apologize but⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you just staring at me like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks upset.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you saying that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think it's weird for me to attend remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I see. It's because of that temporary teacher, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Temporary teacher?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. It's because she's teaching. Geez![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Better luck next time. I canceled that class already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You canceled?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I already passed these courses; I can skip class whenever I want. So I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then why are you in school?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I was checking something at the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Laboratory?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's nothing. Have fun seeing the temporary teacher. Hmph![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am in trouble all the sudden?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't I say I'd attend remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just don't understand what she's saying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She didn't tell me anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you sorry about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ What was it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did you just pick something up and eat it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It won't do me any good to get angry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stay⋯ Calm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*zzz*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*zzz*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you sleeping? Wake up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know that! I'm not a fool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you prefer to attend remedial classes together?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Remedial classes? Now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I want to study together⋯with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why not.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What⋯ What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something strange going on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's good weather.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was trying to talk about something we both had in common. It's sort of ironic really.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Uh-huh. And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just say it casually⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You want to apologize to Ms. Shimazu.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ms. Takeda, what's going on?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ms. Shimazu, this guy is really shy, so he's kinda embarrassed. But, he has something to tell you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't be like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯ You're not wrong. I just don't know how to explain it⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sound like a politician.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Whew.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((Stand up straight.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What can I say now?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean 「apologize」?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He told me he wanted to apologize for being so rude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is that right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's exactly what he said. Anyway, see ya later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that teacher doing?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gasp*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you apologizing for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, uh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just say it casually⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Casually⋯ Oh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I sound like a child.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to be clear.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Curly hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so curly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It makes me want to reach out and tangle my fingers in it.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, no touching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I always act before I think.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not something you should be proud of.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't done anything⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happens when you slide both hands through your hair?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really should stop.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at that clear, blue sky.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see slugs around here all the time.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What nonsense are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to run my tongue across your beautiful skin.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'd rather bathe in a vat of slugs than feel your tongue on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah ha! Does that mean you're into slugs?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of moron?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, now I'm in trouble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The next time you say something like that to me, I'll kick you right in the junk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah! I'm kidding! I'm kidding![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yikes!)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what are you doing now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, the air quality seemed kind of bad, so I thought I'd help you breathe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If you do that again, I'll hit you so hard, it'll knock you into next week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She already hit me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's got a real chip on her shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like a princess⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she hates being called one.)[%p]
