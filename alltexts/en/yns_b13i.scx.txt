[name]Toyotomi[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If you're giving it away, I'll take it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That looks like a card I've seen before. Here, let me take a look.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Wha⋯ Hey, if you don't want to show it to me, don't take it out in the first place.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm not interested.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Is that your Student Notebook, boy?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]A Golden Key⋯ What of it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't need that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Want to challenge me in a discus throw or something?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Wow, those are some nice antiques, nerd.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're going to give it to me? Huh, you changed your mind?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, inflicting bodily harm on someone is punishable by law.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you planning on doing with that?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why do you have that?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hand it over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph! You shouldn't have that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. There's nothing I can do.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I hand it over, what will you do with it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I thought I made it clear: I don't need to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sorry, Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ch-Chief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya. Why are you here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]He's trespassing. I was just reprimanding him for it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]This is bad, Chief. You can't let him into restricted areas.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I-I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, is it true you've been dismissed as head facilitator?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now this guy is taking over your–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ahem! I have some urgent business, so I'll be going.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Hmph. Don't look so pleased with yourself.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's that supposed to mean?))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((She trusts me more than anyone else.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((A woman likes a knight in shining armor more than an unreliable man.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Who are you calling unreliable?))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((You wouldn't call a man who gets his ass handed to him by some punks very reliable.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What did you say?!))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you two talking about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I must be going, Chief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. That scene keeps flashing before my eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I tell her?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't come in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, but⋯[%p]
I wanted to hand over these documents and⋯
Sorry for barging in.
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I'd give it to Toyotomi, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I want to give it to you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the missing page.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Where did you find this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In front of Geo Technics. I found it on the ground, so I thought I'd take it with me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really? That's was good of you⋯ Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I figured I should give it to you instead of him.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry I snuck in⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯ What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Let me have one more good look.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What, you don't want me to?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Then you shouldn't have shown it to me in the first place.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Huh? Could it be?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you hiding? Hmph! If you don't want anyone to see it, you should have never taken it out.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Is this some kind of composite photograph?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You shouldn't mess with adults like that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm not interested.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm not interested.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. I have an even smaller portable computer.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's so small, I can't even use the keyboard to type! Hahaha![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Could that be⋯?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Wait, it's just a regular blue ATM card?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You don't have to show me every little thing you own.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No way, I think I've seen before⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Maybe it's just my imagination.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What a bore. Don't show me stuff like that.[%p]
