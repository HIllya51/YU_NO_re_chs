[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I'm the only one in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anyone else is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't Ms. Eriko the night guard today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess not. She's headed downtown in that outfit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty unlikely she'd be in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko wasn't in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That word she whispered in my ear⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to the school infirmary and check.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems all the students have already left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did all the students go home already?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Naturally, everyone left as soon as the remedial classes and club activities were over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]School detention isn't fun for anyone.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I came to see Mr. Ryuuzouji. Has he been to the school recently?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think he headed home a while ago.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah, okay. I'll go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Hey, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know it's tough, but please do your best. I support you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You smell good.
 Are you wearing cologne?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You smell good. Are you wearing cologne?
[name]Takuya[line]Give me a break. I'm not that kind of guy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I see⋯
 *sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I see⋯*sniff sniff*
[name]Takuya[line]Look at you! You're sniffing at me like a dog! Ryuuzouji, the principal, is at home.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi looks troubled.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh right. There was another lightning strike last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if I can find my old man, I'll have him apologize.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need to go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The remedial classes are over, but there are still a lot of students.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I see you just left the school infirmary. Did you see Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ I only smelled Ms. Eriko's cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's strange. She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't she hate you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No way, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you calling me that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Because I've decided that's your nickname.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've never called me Boss Man before.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well then, how about I call you Head Man, since you've got some kind of hypersense?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, Ms. Ichijou⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Mitsuki? Where is she?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Help! My neck![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. Well?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whew! I thought I was going to die. Your grip is super strong. You must have built it up during all those club activities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what about it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, yeah. That's Ms. Ichijou, right? Well, I just ran into her in the hall here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She asked me where you were.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. What did you tell her?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I told her I thought you went straight home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you say that?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Because you told me, 「I'm leaving right away.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, you did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Okay, then. So where's Mitsuki now?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I think I saw her leave the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She thought I left school⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Haha⋯
Hahaha⋯
Hmh.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Haha⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ Haha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why on earth are you just standing there laughing?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You scared me today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you go find the princess now?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. Right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is outside, and I need to talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did she call me last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's never a dull moment here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are these guys doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Who left the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your name's Kanna, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I wasn't feeling well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the same thing Mio said.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'll just be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's shy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night already? I think I'm the only one in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gates will be closed soon. I need to hurry up and get over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one here in the school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, there's not a single person around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All remedial classes are done for the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is that woman over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, that's the woman I saw leaving the school the other day.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Check out that outfit. I wonder who she is.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Pardon me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she's a new teacher, but if she is, I'll certainly enjoy taking her class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are still a few students in this hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are remedial classes over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I keep going in and out? Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't it getting a little old going to the school infirmary over and over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't bother her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary looks pretty busy right now. I won't bother her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there are still a few stragglers in this hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯ I mean, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does that mean she's with Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you wandering around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ Where's your boss?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He's currently busy, speaking with your mother, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Ryuuzouji and Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just as I thought. She's not here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did we miss each other?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many students. Are they participating in club activities?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to find Ayumi and see what she has to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Ayumi anywhere, but it sounds like she's somewhere in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should find Ayumi and ask her what's going on.[%p]
