[name]Kaori[line]Yeah, that's what I wanted. Whew! I finally got my hands on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was that the right thing to do⋯?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, thank you. Looks like his role is finished.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's he?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't worry about it. Come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are we going?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I know a good back door. Come this way.[%p]
*pat pat pat*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A good back door⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whatever. I'll find out if I go with her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is innocent⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? Wait a second.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How could she know Ayumi is innocent?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, I'm pretty confident that Ayumi didn't do anything, but I don't have proof.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like this woman, Kaori, does⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What is this envelope?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A security card?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We might need that later, so hold on to it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]An ATM card? Or⋯maybe not.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're going to give it to me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe⋯ If you're going to give it to me, then I'll gladly take it.[%p]
Give the card
Never give the card
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe⋯ I'll be taking this then.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't expect anything in return. I only took it because you said you'd give it to me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Awh⋯too bad.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That might have come in handy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is that a coin for the arcade?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I often play games there with the coins I find on the floor.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wait, you don't?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmph. You really are a student.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're a student? How cute⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's a pretty big key.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's it for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There's a lot written in that notebook.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's it for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A discus?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, you're not supposed to whip out sharp objects like that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Put it away.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, my. Are you some kind of gymnast?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Mmm. I now see why you have such a tight body. Hehehe⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Getting tied up is actually pretty fun, you know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wait, that's not what you meant?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Aww⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, will you let me take a closer look at that document?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why are you putting it away all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Who's that picture of? Your girlfriend?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm not interested. She's pretty though.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm not very interested in that. There's a creepy design on it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, part of that new mobile lifestyle, are you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, can I take a closer look at that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why are you putting it away?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Looks like a key to me.[%p]
