[name]Takuya[line]Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was able to get here, so there must be a way to go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been frantically trying to find it for nearly a week now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where the hell is it?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said there should be something out here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why⋯ Damn it all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've looked everywhere I can think of⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm already beyond exhausted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ You again.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What now? What do you want?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think I want your pity? Knock it off![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I'm not in the mood.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The word effort has never felt so meaningless to me.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah⋯ Maybe there really isn't a way to go back.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ I know there is, so I can't just give up.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with you, anyway?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good grief⋯ And why exactly have you been following me every day?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say something⋯ Never mind, I know you can't talk.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't just nod.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't just shake your head, either![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, you can go now. Leave me alone.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you just standing there? I told you to leave.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said go![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm a shitty person⋯aren't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She didn't do anything wrong, yet I snapped at her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's not like I don't have a reason to complain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's been sticking to me like mochi this entire week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't say a peep, just follows me around like a lost puppy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she wants⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there really a way home, like Illia said?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Spent all week searching, and I haven't found a single clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know where else to look⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ There's one more place I haven't checked yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there, beyond those fields⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I have no choice but to go there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter what⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is so dark already⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I may have been too harsh with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she is back⋯[%p]
