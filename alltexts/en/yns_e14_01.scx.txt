[name]Takuya[line]I know where I'm going, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to hurry⋯ I'm getting a bad feeling about this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Kanna went home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's apartment is on the fifth floor at the end of the hall. Apartment 501.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm actually pretty surprised Kanna would live in such a dreary place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember she said she didn't have any family⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could she be living here⋯alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever, I should get that fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A drug that works well for fevers. I know where to go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll only say this once. I don't have any money for medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of the apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have her student handbook with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should probably give it back to her as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ This seems like an excuse, but it's the right thing to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That middle-aged man really bothers me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does he know Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That middle-aged man really bothers me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does he know Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lightbulb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lightbulb in the shape of a basketball on top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is up, so the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night, so the lights are on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a plaque on the entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ It says 「Palace Flat.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the name of this apartment building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me flat out want to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be the name of this apartment building. It's too dark to see though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They do say that a little green helps ease the heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't deny that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A shared residence like this will almost always have trees around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The idiot who built this huge building must've wanted to be 「in harmony with nature」⋯hence the trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There looks to be a lot of units here, but there aren't many people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna doesn't even have neighbors next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna lives in one of these many apartment units.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how many people live here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is clear as far as the eye can see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pure white clouds, blue sky⋯ I can't see the pretty beach, but no doubt it's a perfect day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A star-filled sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you're this far out of the city, you can see so many stars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, am I going in again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think I saw Kanna go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was stumbling and didn't look very steady on her feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the medicine yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go get it already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I want to go back to the Heights, I should choose 「travel」 to Heights on the far left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I'm not trying to sneak into her place in the middle of the night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just returning her student handbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any underlying intentions visiting her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should try going inside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ I promised.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey. Didn't I promise not to become the wolf stalking Little Red Riding Hood?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not feeling well. I should wait until tomorrow to see her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, back to the Heights![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know where I'm going, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure she went in the apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I'll just go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come all the way here in the first place? Oh well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, let's go back to the Heights![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did I come here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to head back to the Heights.[%p]
