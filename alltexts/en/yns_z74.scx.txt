[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anyone is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuyaaaaa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Phew⋯ It seems like the Royal Guard are gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's quiet⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Where do you think you're going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond that altar⋯ There is a machine room.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]A machine room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's difficult to explain, but it's a place full of machines that oversee Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, well⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The God-Monarch is not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about that bearded man with the menacing look?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No, I didn't see him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you go down there?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No, I was strictly told by the God-Monarch not to go in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If I enter, the machine may start to move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯this isn't an earthquake.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yu-No, you said it wouldn't start moving![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I don't know![%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Ahhhhh!!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What was that⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard someone scream![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's the God-Monarch![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No and Amanda, you two wait here.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, you've gotta be kidding.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think. This might be some kind of a trap. What will we do if the three of us go together and they catch us in one swoop?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I go in, and if I don't come out for a while, come and rescue me.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Okay⋯ But be careful.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I wanna go too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, please![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ If something happens to you, what am I going to do?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I'll be okay. If something happens to me, please make sure to come to the rescue.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, I will help you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, then⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, be careful⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Be careful, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ Ryuuzouji!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I won't let him get away with this!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ Don't come close![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]A hostage should not talk⋯heheh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji! Hey![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh, it's nice to see you again⋯ Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have anything to defend yourself with this time.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I have this sword.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]*smirk* You've grown up strong, Takuya Arima. But can't you see this lady I've taken as hostage?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hey, don't move. There's a dagger in my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're bluffing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]And if I am, what will you do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll cut you down![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hah hah. Don't threaten me. I'm a nervous guy. If I get tense and accidentally squeeze her thin arm⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Then don't move⋯haha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's chilly, as usual.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I don't see her, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ Yu-No, be careful.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A long corridor⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anyone is here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond the corridor⋯ So, is it around here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said there's an altar up ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place where the priestess prays.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this⋯the altar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a church.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if the church is considered as sort of a point of contact with God, it may be similar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody⋯ Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone is⋯sleeping?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's get closer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the woman⋯who pointed a sword at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she the priestess⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means⋯ Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Hey, Yu-No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's still breathing. Is she asleep?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's good⋯ She's still alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this feeling⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A naked woman, laying down⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Holding her in my arms so she can sit up⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When was it⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The same thing happened in the past.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been many years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't remember⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯when that was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good, still alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said⋯if I push the button next to the pedestal, she would wake up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This one⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange⋯ She's not waking up at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Hey, Yu-No![%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was Ryuuzouji lying to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it can't be⋯ There was a button beside the pedestal, just as he described.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should wait a little bit longer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, Yu-No⋯is so⋯*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is my heart beating so fast right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it⋯wind?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's wind blowing from behind the pedestal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a gap. Just enough space for a person to go through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind is blowing from there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go there⋯ I'm curious⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just really drawn towards it⋯ What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, please wait. I'll be right back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A narrow passage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It continues somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This passage is quite different from the construction of the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rather than stone⋯it almost feels like steel?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go check it out. I am curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound of heavy machinery is echoing.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that voice just now?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Melgio, restarted after 18,215 seconds⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it coming from?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Oxygen supply system, all green⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like a mechanical voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I'm alone, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived at a strange place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I?[%p]
