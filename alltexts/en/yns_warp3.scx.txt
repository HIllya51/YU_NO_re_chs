[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is so serene⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use⋯ I've shouted as much as I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ It's not like I have any other choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what am I going to say⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know how I ended up in your storehouse. Please unlock the door![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I have no choice but to say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem⋯ Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anyone there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone! Hello?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anyone there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ You can't be serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I really trapped in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've gotta be kidding me. I can't be wasting time in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯ Heeey! Is anyone there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeeey!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Grandma? Anyone?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've gotta be joking⋯ I don't have the time to waste here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is awfully tough for being attached to such a shabby old place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. I need to get out of here, no matter what⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Even if I have to bust this place open by force.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I've done everything I can for now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouting, tackling the door, kicking the walls, even throwing things–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]None of it was particularly helpful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't much in here besides a rusty old hoe⋯ That thing would snap as soon as I try to use it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides that, there's only books in here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ Now what am I going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Screaming out the window should definitely be my last option⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll try to find another way out first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it comes down to it, maybe I can call for help by shouting out of here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd really like to avoid that if possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Ryuuzouji finds me, who knows what he'll do⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup, looks like I can't get out from here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Too small⋯ If only I was a bit slimmer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That⋯probably wouldn't help, actually. The opening is only about 20cm wide; it's barely big enough for a baby.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A window. I can see the blue sky outside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Light is creeping into the dim storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt it'll do much to illuminate this place, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked⋯ I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's locked⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A metal door. There seems to be another room on the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not like anyone's going to open it if I knock⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's metal⋯ This door is so much more secure compared to the rest of this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's another room on the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably just like this over there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A pillar⋯ Staring at it certainly won't help me get out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No good⋯ I can't get out from here, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I can climb up this pillar onto the roof⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Nah, probably not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The pillar that supports the storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The central pillar holding up the storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A thick pillar that seems to be supporting the whole storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desk looks old and worn out⋯just like the rest of this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An old desk⋯ It looks pretty beat up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I slam this desk against the door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯then the desk would probably just shatter into pieces.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An old desk⋯ It looks pretty beat up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like an antique⋯ There are decorations carved into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corners are all worn out⋯ It looks very old.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I throw this at the wall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯It wouldn't do a thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Need to find an exit somehow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't afford to just stay in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, is this door the only way out of here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That metal door over there won't even budge, either⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this place is just used for storage?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what this thing is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa⋯ I'll have to be sure not to mess with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at all this stuff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems overly complex⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are tons of books stacked here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can do for now is wait until someone passes by⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess I'll read a book?[%p]
Read the book
Don't read it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Why not? Standing here like an idiot isn't going to help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll read a book⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯But wow, this is quite the collection. Did Ryuuzouji actually read all of these?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It says 「Legacy」 on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I remember correctly, this book was written in collaboration by my old man, Ryuuzouji, and some other professor named Imagawa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a complicated technical book that starts with an examination of history, and it even touches upon things like mathematics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's about some natives that lived in Sakaimachi since olden times⋯ I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From a historical standpoint, it discusses the revolutionary reforms that happen once every 400 years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Revolutionary reforms that happen once every 400 years,」 huh⋯ Hahaha, this is worse than those so-called prophecies by what's-his-face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you look hard enough, you could find some big changes even over a one-year span.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where that bastard is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could he be doing after leaving me and Ayumi behind?[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Takuya⋯ There's something I need to tell you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You're a pig-headed, perverted old bastard?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Indeed.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯You won't even deny it?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((But you know, Ayumi still loves me, hahaha!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What's the matter? Jealous, boy?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Shut up, you perverted old bastard. You better not have made Ayumi wear a schoolgirl uniform again.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I've only done that once.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Once is more than enough!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hmph, and who's the one that had blood spurting out of his nose from seeing her in that outfit?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Who's to say⋯ Anyway, why did you call me here?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Well, the thing is⋯ Ayumi's late on her period⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I lied.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Still haven't gotten over that Oedipus complex, have you?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What do you want?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((There's something I've been meaning to tell you⋯before I depart on my journey.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Don't worry, I won't be long. I'm just going mountain climbing for a little while.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((And?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((There's a chance that my trip may take a bit longer than expected.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You'd better not be going to visit some lover of yours.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Not a chance. I've cut ties with her about two years ago.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?! So you 「did」 have a lover two years ago?!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Is that envy I hear in your voice?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You piece of shit. Go beg Ayumi for forgiveness.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hahahah⋯ But you see, Ayumi still loves me.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Why are there tears in your eyes?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Shut up. So you may be gone mountain climbing longer than expected. Is that all?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯If I don't end up returning⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯What was that? I couldn't hear you.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((If I end up being late–))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Read the journal left here in this study.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Journal⋯? You mean a diary?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Fool, it's a journal: written records of things I've experienced.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((So, a diary.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Unlike a diary, a journal isn't something you write in every day.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I see, so⋯a diary is a collection of multiple journal entries.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ahem. So then, do you understand what I've told you?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You're basically telling me to read your journal, right?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((That's right. It appears even your louse-sized brain had no problems comprehending that.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((No way in hell am I reading it now.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Aw, don't be like that. Just read it to kill time when you get bored.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Let me read it now, then.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You wouldn't really understand it if you read it now.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Takuya, one day you will be involved in a certain incident. Only when that happens will my journal reveal its true value.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Time to eat!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ah, Ayumi cooked some food for us. We're having sukiyaki today!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What's with the long face? I'll be leaving tomorrow, you know?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Dad⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hm?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Are you hiding something from me?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((No.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Really?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Really. I'm just choosing not to talk about it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hey⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((To hide something is to keep silent about that which must be kept hidden. In my case, I have no need to hide it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((And since you're just not talking about it, you're not actually hiding it?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Listen, Takuya⋯ You must read the journal in my study. If you do, the path will reveal itself to you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((The journal⋯inside my old man's study⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man's journal⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My father's journal in his study⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But there's nothing left in his study anymore⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji took it all⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing left anymore⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing⋯anymore?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place⋯ That's right, I'm inside the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already dark out⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's nighttime⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must have dozed off as I was reading.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Hey, there it is again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep hearing that faint noise in the distance⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's it coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ Now's not the time to be reading books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be reading books right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to find a way out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What an impressive collection⋯ I wonder if it belongs to Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯But it does seem to be abandoned here in the storage room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe he read all these books already and didn't want to trade them in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So many books⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why are they all stacked up in the storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe these books weren't needed anymore⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's the case, did Ryuuzouji read through all of these?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But man, what a collection⋯ It might even rival my dad's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's plain to see that Ryuuzouji is a scholar like my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is pretty damn old⋯ Guess I shouldn't be too surprised to find something like this in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's too rusty to be of any use.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's a hoe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hoe: a long-handled gardening tool with a thin metal blade, used mainly for weeding and breaking up soil.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah, guess you can call me the walking dictionary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Who am even I talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This part seems to stand out a bit⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this spot got repainted?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This plaster⋯was imported from Lancaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone must have put that plaster stuff on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, plaster is the stuff they use as coating on ceilings and walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Who am I explaining this to again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This wall is so much whiter than the rest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A rope⋯ Should I take it?[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Rope][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Rope][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]This is where that rope was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's not here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a strong rope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could take it if I wanted, but I don't really need it right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What to do⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know standing here and looking around isn't going to do any good, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a quiet storehouse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry up and find an exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My nose is getting itchy just standing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't like being here in all this dust⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Am I really going to stay trapped in this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place smells like mold and dust⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I was allergic, I'd be sneezing like crazy right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man⋯ How am I going to get out of here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Nope. Can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just go outside and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-It's locked⋯ Ah, that's right, that giant padlock must have locked from the outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯ I'm stuck in here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've gotta be kidding me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit⋯ It's way tougher than it looks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯ It won't open.[%p]
