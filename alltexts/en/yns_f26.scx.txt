[name]Takuya[line]The corridor in Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, I'm pretty sure Ayumi's office was through the door on the left.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm, you've been here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you could say that. I needed something from Ayumi⋯my stepmom. Her office is on the left.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. But we're heading for the front door. It leads to the lab with double security.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There's one more thing we need to use there, other than the blue card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You see that card slot on the side of the door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The door on the left has a blue light, but the one in the back should be red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A blue light indicates a regular security card. If the light is red, you have to make it turn blue, then use the blue card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means even if we use the blue card on the door in the back, we still can't get in right now.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Exactly. We have to unlock it first from the control room or a similar place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯ How do you know all this?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, that's a silly question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm heading to the control room now. We have to turn the light blue before doing anything else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait, what about me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Just wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You expect me to do that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's easier for me to go alone. Don't worry, I won't leave you here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]However, just because this is a mostly empty building thanks to all its automation, that doesn't mean you can just walk around as you please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I should stay right here?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Exactly. You got it? Don't go anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After Kaori ran away⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a magnetic card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the blue card Kaori was talking about. It's not even blue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Magnetic Card][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Magnetic Card][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori left. I guess I can make myself at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I know she said to stay put, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
