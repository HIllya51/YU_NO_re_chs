[name]Takuya[line]It's the main hall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It always makes me wonder. Is it okay for the school security to be this lax?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just walked right in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are still students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main hall is as noisy as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost scary quiet when there aren't any people, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is more noise than normal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main hall is as noisy as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost scary quiet when there aren't any people, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school is so quiet without all the people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It's almost nighttime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the people in their clubs and practicing sports have left.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Pardon me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who's that? She's a pretty flashy woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looked like she was coming from the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a beautiful woman. She was a little flashy, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The first floor main hall.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That voice⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Yuuki. It's you. Stop calling me that, would you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Heh heh, school in-firm-a-ry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Grr, you can't hide it. Hatano came out of the school infirmary fixing her clothes, and you came out a minute later, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's really got his eyes open.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So if the school physician, Ms. Takeda, isn't there, that can only mean one thing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Chess?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What are you talking about? So, what about Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she was feeling pretty good so⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She was good? Grr, dammit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So the rumors are true?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're always sitting next to Mio, wrapped around her little finger anyway.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No I'm not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? You don't look well.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, nothing. Have you seen Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She left halfway through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Without permission from the teacher?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah. And I need a substitute for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll be in trouble if your teacher finds out.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I know. And I definitely don't want to take remedial classes for my remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure you can sub for Mio with your voice.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It doesn't work that way. I feel sorry for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're too nice.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But Miss Mio is awful. She didn't even tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why should she have to tell you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe it was that noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What noise?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I heard a loud noise from far off. Miss Mio jumped when she heard it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A loud noise, from far off?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, it might have been a car backfiring. It sounded like a gun, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I should look around a little more. Well then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bell just rang so remedial classes must be over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are remedial classes over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are still a lot of students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People from remedial classes and club activities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, um. Hey, why did the orange stop? Because it ran out of juice.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's good manners to laugh a little. Oh come on, don't make such a frowny face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It just fuels my energy. To overcome this challenge of making her laugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Getting heated up by myself won't help anything. I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside. I wonder if the remedial classes are over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be people from afterschool clubs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an unusual amount of people.[%p]
