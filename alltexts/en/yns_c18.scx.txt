[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There doesn't seem to be anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see Ayumi now.[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should meet back up with Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A place Mio would go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not in the downtown area. I looked all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll keep searching somewhere else![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll try looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like construction is already finished.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Finished is not the right word. It just turned to night while the construction was interrupted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the construction is still on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the construction's on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the construction is still on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline. The construction is supposed to be on hiatus now.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Pardon me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji is heading toward Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is he up to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say it's none of my business, but I wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the base of Triangle Mountain is a restricted area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll probably run into that porn director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's Ryuuzouji going there for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? He's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did he go⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi should be at Geo Technics about now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. Geo Technics is on top of the hill in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Ayumi trusts that Toyotomi guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I just can't trust him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to talk to him just once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like that jerk isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would the construction workers tell me something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like that jerk isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are people, but it doesn't look like they're working on the construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because of the accident?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like that jerk isn't here either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He always comes out yelling at me, so he must've gone somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here! I think I know where she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't find Ayumi fast, something bad might happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe if I go to Geo Technics, I'll find out.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, funny running into you at this hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Isn't it a little late for students to be out walking around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what are you doing out this late, Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Sorry to keep you waiting, Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ah, there she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's that lady named Kaori.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Tonight's just a preliminary investigation. They're harder to crack than I thought.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was going to say the same thing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ryuuzouji, who is this kid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who's she calling a kid?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I just happened to run into him here. There's no need to worry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see. All right.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We'll be going then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what those two were doing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, Ayumi is my priority now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will Ayumi be there if I go to Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why I am wandering around with headache medicine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I hurry home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no drug store here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beach is quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to believe there was a lightning strike in the afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh. It's so dark already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she was so focused on the briefing, she forgot the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction noise is all quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, with all those accidents, it couldn't be helped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Good evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Good evening, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna? You scared me⋯ What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Well⋯ I was praying for those that died in the accident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no, did someone you know die in the lightning strike?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I see.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You did well at that briefing, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you saw it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. You were wonderful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't that good⋯ It just didn't seem like the right way to protest. My condolences to their families though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pardon me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you say this afternoon that there might be more casualties?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There weren't any casualties, but there was another lightning strike.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm not sure what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you know that there'd be a lightning strike?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't know. I just said there was a possibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There's been a lot of lightning strikes lately, so I thought it might happen again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't think the lightning strikes will stop just yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]As long as there are people with ambition and curiosity in their hearts, the accidents won't go away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I should go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as there are people with ambition and curiosity⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯the accidents won't go away?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could all of this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you worried about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she's probably at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no more smoke. I guess it wasn't much of a fire.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I suppose that's good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of people gathering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she said they were doing that briefing or whatever at the company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a bunch of men are talking to one person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's that Toyotomi guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't look like much of a friendly chat, either.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]U-Uh, I'm not the one to ask.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Aren't you the one who ordered the transportation?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Yeah, you knew there would be an accident![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Th-That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Those accidents only happened during transportation. That's why the construction was stopped until now![%p]
[name]Man[line]And you said it was going to be okay![%p]
[name]Man[line]What's 「okay」?! There was a lightning strike!!![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I told you, I'm merely the on-site director.[%p]
[name]Man[line]There was another casualty of the lightning yesterday. Luckily this time people were only injured.[%p]
[name]Man[line]We can't keep working in such a dangerous environment.[%p]
[name]Man[line]That's right![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]P-Please calm down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's an argument between construction workers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like it's getting pretty heated.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Y-You're making a mistake. I was merely following orders from my superior. Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]Your superior?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Th-That's right. A woman named Chief Arima is the one who is in charge here. All I did was follow orders.[%p]
[name]Man[line]So where is this Chief Arima?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]W-Well, she's supposed to be holding a briefing.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey, guys. Let's go to the company building and talk to her directly.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Okay, let's tell that chief what we have to say.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I bet she doesn't care about the lives of us construction workers.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Yeah, let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main construction workers went toward the company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are only a few workers remaining.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*sigh* Boy, what a ruckus.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]They think they're so tough when they gang up on somebody.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you finally noticed me.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A human.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you were just blowing smoke back there.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saying Ayumi ordered you to continue transportation⋯ That's bullshit![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, I had to say that to save my own life. Those construction workers are too violent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You jerk.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, I'll stop you right there. Where is the evidence that I made that decision on my own?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I won't listen to your guesses and conjectures. It's a nuisance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You just said it yourself.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't remember that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe this guy.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]And even if I did act independently, for instance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]A boss is in charge of those under them. Meaning that the responsibility still falls on Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You bastard.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now it's the chief's job to soothe those ruffians. I hope she handles it well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, away with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. Right in the middle of the construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gag*[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What was with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what people do when they see something nauseating.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, well, I'm sure you'd recovered as soon as you saw my beautiful face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gag*[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, I don't have time for the likes of you. I have to find the chief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The chief? You mean Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The briefing will soon start at the company building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Brief? You talking about men's underwear?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Are you slow? A briefing. It's an explanatory meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Goodness, the irritating protesters are growing problematic. The meeting is just explaining how we're carefully ensuring a safe construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say you're being safe, but what about all those accidents?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Tch. It is true that there have been three casualties in the past week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But we always put safety first and our conditions are more than above standard. So there shouldn't be a problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what about the accidents?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Tch. Aah, I'm so busy now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're dodging the question.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*sigh* Even so, just what is the chief doing? She said she was going to meet the school headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The briefing can't start without her. Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Ayumi's holding a public meeting.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Anyway, you can't be wandering around here without the permission from the person with the highest authority: me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who'd you say was the person with the highest authority?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That would be me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh⋯ Aren't you under Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Chief Arima, she⋯is the boss of the person with the highest authority.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you're not really the highest, then.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're very picky. That's not very becoming of a young man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy okay?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, yes, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If the chief isn't here, then I am the person with the highest authority.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Which means I can also transport that ore now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ore?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm sure there won't be lightning on a sunny day like this. Chief Arima worries too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's just talking to himself⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Okay, let me try to use my authority here. Hey, you! We're transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said they were transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that all right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sorry, I wasn't looking and⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's you, Mio. Why are you looking at the ground and mumbling?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, my precious notebook is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never mind. It's nothing. You wouldn't know about it, would you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your precious⋯notebook?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to talk to her as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's construction going on, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People, trucks, and fences. That's definitely a construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only place I can think of to observe the construction⋯ So where is Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey you! You can't just walk around here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it's that guy.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen, you can't come in here without my permission as the construction director⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, his name was Toyotomi or something. Ayumi's number one stalker.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I've seen you before. Are you a student?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, this is a restricted area, so I can't have you just walking in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came to see Ayumi. Is she here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hrrmm, that's right you were⋯yes, the chief's distant relative.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm her son.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Right, her adopted son as a single, unmarried mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is married, and I'm not adopted. I'm her stepson.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I see, tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with this guy?)[%p]
