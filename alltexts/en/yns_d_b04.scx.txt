[name]Takuya[line]There's only one path, so I don't think we'll get lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing more important than being careful as we proceed.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's why you're the Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's still going?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! How far do I have to go?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is this the way we should be going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't ask me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But we've just been walking for so long⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. But there's only one path, so this has to be right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you don't think so, Yuuki, you can go back by yourself.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't kid around like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even Yuuki, who's normally so clueless, can tell this is bad⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing I can do in this situation though. Hell, I'd love to have some kind of reassurance too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's tougher than I thought⋯)[%p]
