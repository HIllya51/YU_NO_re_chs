[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is sleeping.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't talk to Kanna anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I was happy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You said we could live together⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll be together starting tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I was really happy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you talking about? Don't use past tense. It's starting now.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I had a dream, for just a little while. It was better than anything I'd ever had in my entire life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna, what are you saying?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I lived so long just to not die, and you gifted me with such a wonderful moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't even joke like that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's⋯too late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean it's too late?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Without that stone, I cannot live⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That⋯stone? The one that fell in the fountain?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That was the flame of life. That is the peculiarity I share with my mother, and your mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You've got to be kidding. I'll go find a couple stones like that and–[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you⋯ For showing me happiness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kanna. Open your eyes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima⋯ Please find your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop messing around. I don't care about him.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Your father⋯he was very kind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There was⋯something I wanted to give you⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Say something.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hate jokes like this.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯ Stop joking![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what about the other thing?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The other one is for⋯you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Can I sleep for a little while?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sleep?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯ I'm a little tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But here? And the way you're dressed⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There is⋯something I want to give you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯ Something from your father⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your mother must be the lady in that picture.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The girl next to her. That must be you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How many years ago was that picture taken?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I've forgotten. It was a long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was my mother like?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]She seemed very kind. I only spoke to her once. She was quiet and always smiling. She was a lovely person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. That's what I thought.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So my old man⋯ He took you in⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]He was a very kind person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. That's impressive for that bastard.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Koudai Arima asked three things of me when he left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you tell me what they were?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I have to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]One was about Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The place you're always watching?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. He wanted me to warn those who didn't know better to avoid digging around Sword Cape⋯ For their own sakes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]And another was a message.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ From who to who?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This is what he said. 「Whoever is seeking me may contact you. I can only think of two people it could be.」[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]「One would be someone unknown. Someone after the jewel.」[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]「The other would be a straightforward, impulsive idiot. If you meet this idiot, you have to tell him exactly what I say.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that idiot is me?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm merely repeating your father's message.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I know. So what did he say?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]「When all the jewels are together, a new path will open⋯ I'm waiting for you.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's what he said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So those are my father's words?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]They are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what a selfish bastard.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He uses people whenever he likes. I can't just do what he tells me to.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back to my normal life, with you⋯ Right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will never run on the rails he set down for me⋯ Never.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's start tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like there's more hope to live now.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're an interesting person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something even more interesting is waiting for you at my house.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I look forward to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me too.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, can I ask you one thing?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I know⋯ I know what you want to ask.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Okay, then tell me your bust, waist, and hip measurements.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pfft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See? You can't know what I want to ask that easily.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I guess so⋯31, 21, 32.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pretty thin. I thought your clothes just made you look thinner than you are.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I have a poor figure, unfortunately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not true. I love small boobs.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Liar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay, what about big boobs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like big boobs, too.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You like any boobs, as long as it's on a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess you could say that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Heehee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're cute when you smile.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]N-No I'm not⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's blushing. Th-This really is cute.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]My mother was built really well. You'd faint if you saw her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-H-How big was she?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's a secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe⋯ I won't tell someone who says things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's definitely better.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I really appreciate how you feel but⋯ But I am⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I don't care how many years you've been around, or what you had to do with my father.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What are you saying⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to live with you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just tell me it's okay.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Y-Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You already said yes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Th-That was⋯because you said something shocking, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm serious.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you don't say yes, I'll run around the school yard naked.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]P-Please don't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll run until you say okay. And I'll scream 「Kaaannnnnaaa」 the whole time.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Pfft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I actually believe you'd do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I said I was serious.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're quite aggressive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, if you're decided, we have to move your stuff quick. Since we're on summer break now, I can help you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you⋯ I really am happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to thank me like that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No⋯ I really am happy. It's nice that there's someone who needs me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Won't you live with me?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, um, that's not what I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be so alarmed.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house has a lot of empty rooms now. If you want to, you can live at my house.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If my old man decided to be your guardian, then I'll finish what he started.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But at your house there's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean Ayumi? It's totally fine. She's always said she wanted a girl.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to worry. I promise I'll convince her.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can go to school, study, and you get three meals a day.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I⋯ I have to pay you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to worry about money. You don't have to live with someone you don't even like anymore.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want, you can just help with the house chores a little.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]House chores?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Despite her looks, Ayumi is a career-centered woman. My family is really bad at getting house chores done.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But I⋯ I can only cook a little, and I'd be a burden to your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No you wouldn't be. I mean, you made me breakfast, and it was, like, really good.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]All I did was cut vegetables and scramble some eggs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd be happy to die if I could eat that every day.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, you're funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So how about that as your rent?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaddaya say, huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her sleeping face is peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nooo!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm such an idiot!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't thinking about her⋯ Not at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my fault⋯ My responsibility![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my fault she's dead!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That little stone was keeping her alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?! What the hell was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you really have to die for it?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wake up!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
((Arima⋯ Please find your father.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
((Find him⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's asleep now. Unbelievably peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just glad she didn't suffer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Old man⋯ That bastard, shit!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come out!!! You son of a bitch!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll never forgive him. Once I've treated him like a human punching bag, then I'll have him carefully explain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I promise I'll come back here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯ I'll come back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So please wait for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I promise I'll be back!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯ Hey, Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ She's cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's body⋯ Is cold⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-It's because of the rain. It has to be because of the rain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rain is making the ground wet. That's why she's cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-This has to be a joke. This is a joke, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did I really want to see her smile, like this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she not⋯breathing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sh-She's not breathing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This⋯this can't be![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-Is she not breathing?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna's nose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's tiny and cute.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're staring at weird places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. Even your nostrils are cute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hair is so smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet from the rain.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're worrying about me. That's very kind of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care about grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't it itchy?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe. I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't hurt?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm all right. Grass is nature's bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold⋯ She's cold⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, your body looks great too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your body's beautiful. So pale it's almost translucent.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you. You're the only one who says that, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your whole body is cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to touch it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, please be gentle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's tiny and cute.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ooh⋯ Don't touch that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold here, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's small breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your breasts are small. So different from Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Are you disappointed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not at all! They're cute. I like them.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your body is cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look so soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until a minute ago you were⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please don't say it aloud. I'm shy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The greenery doesn't matter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The greenery is blowing in the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're outside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. This won't work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this stone?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought Kanna just said something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Kanna![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]A-Arima⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ Yes![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima⋯why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay? Do you feel all right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why⋯am I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here⋯ Take this.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This⋯ How did you find this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about the details. The important thing is that you're safe and alive.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I didn't think I'd be able to talk to you like this again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you went to sleep, I thought⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There is something I want to give you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing you got from my old man?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's in my room. He asked me to make sure I give it to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something from my old man for me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I can't find it, I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing you wanted to give me⋯ Is it the key to my old man's study?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh, do you have it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. That is what I wanted to give you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I can use the key to my father's study there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's usually open, but at that time⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I received this from your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This? It looks like a key.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't know. He said the idiot would understand if I gave it to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-Idiot?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh⋯ Those were your father's words.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That does sound like him, but what is this key for?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That reminds me. He said it was the key to a study or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key to the study?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The door to my father's study has been left open for a while.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything of the old man's was already taken by Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or is it a key to a different study?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That reminds me, there was a time when my father's study was locked.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He locked the study.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When was it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be when⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like the door to the study was locked then.)[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Key to Study][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Key to Study][color index="800000"].
[name]Kanna[line]You are going to leave now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I know. Your father told me so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'll wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No matter how long it takes: when it's all over, please come back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh heh. I'll find the old bastard and drag him in front of you, Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Good luck to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
