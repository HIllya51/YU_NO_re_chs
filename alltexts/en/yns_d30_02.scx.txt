[name]Takuya[line]It's a well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯ Where are you, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Mitsuki's voice⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, Takuya, where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I should go to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't. If I could get down there, I might be able to get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can I get down there though? I doubt I could climb down the walls of the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, I wish I had a rope or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*groan*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant* I can't reach it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rock isn't in that part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this? There's a hole here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like the rock fell out right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be looking at that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There, in the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rocks are piled up near the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a very deep well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so dark at the bottom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking down into it isn't going to get me anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I have other things to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bottom is so dark. It looks like a dried up old well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how deep it is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can just get down there, I might be able to get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't be able to without a rope or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I had a rope, I might be able to get it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be the dried up well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like anything is in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some kind of paper. Something is written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should try throwing a pebble down it.[%p]
*toss*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty deep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't hear any water either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That must mean it's dried up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the surface of the water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty deep too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like someone piled up some rocks to make a well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wells are really old fashioned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks old too. Seems like it's been years since someone used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of rocks piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made like a pretty traditional well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks really heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a pretty heavy stone disc.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it was used as the cap to the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say it looks barren, but it actually looks more overgrown than anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's lots of vegetation growing around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to the storehouse entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if I use this rope⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tie one end to this tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I can drop the other end down the well. It's best to tie knots in intervals for something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll silently sneak down toward it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, just a bit more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a little further⋯*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* What the?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant* I really didn't think the rope would come untied. Whew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rope fell down to the bottom of the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But at least I got this piece of paper and the silver medal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's written on it? It's blurred and difficult to read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Use⋯and the door shall be opened.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door shall be opened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What door? What's going to open?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll have to hold on to this Silver Medal for now.[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Silver Medal][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Silver Medal][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's nothing in the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do with that rope?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
