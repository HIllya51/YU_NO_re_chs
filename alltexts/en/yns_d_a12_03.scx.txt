[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! Something happened to Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I do? What should I do?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How was it? Did you find anything?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, can't you do something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is there no way to open this door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There has to be some way, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there something I can use to break this thing down?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Did you find something to destroy the stone door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ Maybe I should try using an item.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is trapped behind this solid stonework.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Isn't there anything I can do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's giving me a worried look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! Isn't there anything I can do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see the fear in her eyes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course she's afraid⋯ This stupid stone door separated us⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the cave I went through⋯ No one's there, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something happened to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The passage continues on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something happened to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I didn't know this cave would turn out to be so dangerous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my fault if something happened to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only this door weren't here, I'd be able to go help her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, if I never opened it in the first place⋯ If I never brought Mitsuki here to begin with⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. The more I think about it, the worse I feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could ask myself 「What if?」 all day, but there's no point dwelling on things I can't change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯ It is my responsibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can just barely talk to Mitsuki on the other side thanks to this hole.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole in the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's small, but it's enough to communicate with Mitsuki on the other side.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, I'm scared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it all, if only this stupid door wasn't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't there something I can do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt it. I can't open it, not with my strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't there some way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! If only this annoying door wasn't here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's no use. It'd be impossible to open with brute force alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, Mitsuki is trapped on the other side of this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a sturdy door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do as long as I can't find a way to open this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I said I'd think of something, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to get past such a sturdy door?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it. Why does this stupid door have to be so strong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way I could break this thing down on my own.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around here won't get this stone door open. Mitsuki won't be coming back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my fault that Mitsuki is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! I'm such an idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki! If you can hear me, just listen![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get you out of there! Don't lose hope![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go. That's all I can do right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]While I'm staying around here, Mio might end up in the same situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on a second. Mitsuki hasn't come back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll try going back to that room.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Please⋯ It's so cold. Hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. Wait right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do about this stupid door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If I use the Iron Sword, then maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, step back for a second.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hiya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! Again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My wrist hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. This rock is a lot stronger than I thought.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, isn't there anything you can do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! There has to be a way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I can't break the door down, I'll have to open it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Open it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, how did I open it in the first place?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, why didn't I realize this sooner? You can open it, Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can open the door.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We're having all this trouble because you can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I opened it once already.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, if you do the same thing I did, then maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah! Why didn't I think of that sooner?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on a second![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki! Don't go running off![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll be right back. First, the other side⋯ Ahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki! What's wrong?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh no! I'm going to fall![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong, Mitsuki?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This hole wasn't here before! When did it appear?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It must be⋯because the door closed![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something happened to her⋯ Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya! Help me![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, answer me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be pissed if you're just messing around! Answer me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're kidding, right? What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! If only this stupid door wasn't in the way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! What am I going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use my father's letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you expect me to do with this card?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use this medal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna's notebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That has nothing to do with my current situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like I can use this key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This notebook has nothing to do with this right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Disc doesn't fit here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe if I could come at it from the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way a wooden sword could break stone like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only I had something tougher⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tie it up with a rope?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try taking this seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This document doesn't matter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you expect me to do with this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have I gone mad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The White Medal⋯ This is no use to me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Black Medal⋯ It's no use right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only this thing could split a rock in half⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you giving this any serious thought at all?[%p]
