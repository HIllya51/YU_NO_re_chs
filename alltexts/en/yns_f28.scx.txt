[name]Takuya[line]The park at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to head back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The park at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's still a bit of time left before 10 o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The park at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy, Houjou, isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's still a bit of time left before 10 o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't get Kanna before he shows up, this will all be for nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The deal was to exchange information.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means there's no point to me staying here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've come to Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's that sitting over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Kanna?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's playing with a puppy.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ahahaha! Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Puppy[line]*sniff* *lick lick*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, I said stop that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh, come on⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, ahahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is laughing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think I've ever seen her laugh before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can I put this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, sheesh, what am I going to do with you.[%p]
[name]Puppy[line]*lick lick*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ohhh! Not in my ear! Hehe.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh, you're a little troublemaker.[%p]
[name]Puppy[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, aww. You're such a little sweetheart.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm sorry, but today's my last day⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's why I'm going to pet you a whole bunch.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]From tomorrow on, I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]How long am I going to live like this?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Until the last ember of life is extinguished inside me⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ah! No, bad dog![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]If I lose this, I wouldn't be able to survive⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Whenever I'm with him, I get so excited for some reason.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I wonder why. I've never felt this way before⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Actually, I think I have. Just once.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But it wasn't as strong of a feeling as this.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Who is that person? Who is he to me?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But soon enough, I'll⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What can I do about these feelings⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh shit!)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]A-Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry, I wasn't spying on you or anything.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dude, I thought I had something to say to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just say it.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna, I heard you dropped out of school?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you do that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's your fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What would you think if I said that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Don't worry. It's because I've corrupted public morals. That's why I'm leaving school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean⋯corrupting public morals?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's what people say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're kidding, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why would I be kidding?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Because having intimate relations with random people goes against morals and logic?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're just like the rest of them, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm not. I'm not trying to impose some cheap ideas of morals on you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, Arima. You're⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm interested in you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure why. It's not about your behavior or my old man, either. I'm just interested in you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said your parents died when you were young, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I lost my mom when I was young, too.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even recall what she looks like, but sometimes I remember her. Of course, her face is blurred out in my memories.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But for some reason, when I saw you this morning, it reminded me of my mother. Is that weird?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's why I can't be around you any longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please! Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are so many things I want to ask her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](About my old man⋯about her quitting school⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And about that picture⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is my heart pounding so hard?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait. I still want to ask you something![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the park again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just to let you know, it's not quite 10 o'clock yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meiunji Park. Kids are playing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm supposed to meet that guy Houjou here at 10 o'clock tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not ten o'clock yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means there's no point to me staying here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a regular park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to head back to the Heights.[%p]
