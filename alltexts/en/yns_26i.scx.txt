[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already used it. Now all I have to do is push the panel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll use the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, now⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't have to do it that many times, do I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll use the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, now⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I just have to work the control panel now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How does she know that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have to do it over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll use the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the door is already open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I do it, the same thing still happens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. The door isn't opening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I try the one over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same as the other one⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think a card goes in this slit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try putting it in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I heard a sound. Did that open the door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I have to use it now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I use this card, it won't get me inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need the Blue Card to get in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori has the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I can't get inside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I tried using it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I use it on this door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I tried using it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I seems like it would open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I try the one over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same as the other one⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think a card goes in this slit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try putting it in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I heard a sound. Did that open the door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened. Hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use :selitem: for :selatr:⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off, what am I supposed to do with :selitem: on :selatr:?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's give it some more thought⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I don't think those go together very well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't use :selitem: there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't supposed to be used for :selatr:, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't something I can use now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening⋯ Well, that's not surprising.[%p]
