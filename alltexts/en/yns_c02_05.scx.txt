[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Man oh man, what a brash, unromantic guy you are. You just don't know how to be patient, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! I won't forgive all of your lies and bullshit![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Lies? Where's your proof that I'm lying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Urgh⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]How could you condemn me without evidence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You did this![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]This is unacceptable! I kept quiet because you are Ayumi's stepson, but I can't ignore this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about? You cheated Ayumi![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Huh. I knew you'd end up saying that. This is why I hate dealing with young people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You⋯ You hurt Ayumi![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Stop. I'm no good at fighting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut the hell up! Get down on your knees and apologize for what you've done![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Based on your false accusations?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need evidence! You don't even deserve to exist![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now that's just unreasonable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh it's gone beyond reasonable, you bastard![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Whoa! A-Ayumi, your son has completely snapped![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! This bastard–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey! Stop it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop. Please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How could Ayumi hit me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She was always smiling, always kind to me⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please don't embarrass me any more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I was just⋯ It was for you, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Thanks for saving me. Your son is crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you all right, Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yeah, I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, Ayumi⋯ Shit!!![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel so stupid.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I did my best for Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was trying to⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just wanted Ayumi to thank me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should just relax and be myself. I'm complaining too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I'm just a wimp.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know I shouldn't be down on myself like this, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't care anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know why I even bother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wandered all the way downtown without thinking about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ah, good. Nice to see you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I was looking for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah. I told you we were going to clear Ayumi of suspicion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]After you left, I found this outside Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's that document page. I got lucky and found the missing page of the document, the 20th page, in the planter in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's thanks to you, really, and your help alleviating suspicion⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You look like you've aged 30 years overnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've had enough.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With Ayumi. I've had enough.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So many things happened.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, why don't you come with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you want to come with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? I don't have anything of value. And anyway, what benefit am I to you, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I found the document thanks to your hint. And⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm not always just thinking of myself. And when I say that, I mean it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you coming or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I won't accomplish anything by wandering around town.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll go with Kaori.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Come to my hotel. When you're upset, sometimes a drink helps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure I should be drinking after tonight⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Haha! They've got milk, too, if you want it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here's the hotel.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The entrance is this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it okay to go in without permission?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Fool. Didn't I tell you this is where I stay now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Here. Come on in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, I guess it's okay.)
⋯[%p]
⋯[%p]
⋯[%p]
⋯[%p]
⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She always keeps a smile on her face around me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was always nice to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She may not be blood, but she's my mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if I could support her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I could take care of Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stoooooop!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp* *pant pant*[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You were having a nightmare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, yeah. Nothing to worry about.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]「Ayumi!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sh-Shut up. I was just talking in my sleep.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]This is the end. Well, show me the evidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the end.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It might be best to use a Jewel here, just in case.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What happened? Show me the evidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to show this bastard some kind of proof.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, what's going on? Without evidence, everything you say about me are just lies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Evidence, evidence⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, is there anything?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, get lost. I still have business with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you talking about the secret documents?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to deny it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's not a very nice thing to say. I don't know what I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I'll say it for you. Toyotomi, I know you have stolen documents and you're about to sell them to another company.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Wow, that's something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. And now I remember something else, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the one responsible for yesterday's lightning strikes, aren't you? You were trying to make Ayumi look bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it! You were trying to make her look bad, and then suddenly the theft happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll bet you hired the thieves that did it! You're doing everything you can to force Ayumi into a corner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you were missing one crucial thing, so you asked Ayumi for the remaining documents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Wow, this guy you've created in your head is quite the villain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's all true![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You don't know that. Where is the evidence?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The evidence⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need something effective I can use to prove it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't be so naive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're not a kid anymore. You should be more careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're a grown man, but you're still an idiot with no tact whatsoever. Now get out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is my house. You should leave, not me.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's not gonna work for me. I still have business here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got no business with you.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Then why don't you ask her?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please⋯ Takuya, leave.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What she said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why Ayumi?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi won't tell me anything more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Because of this bastard right in front of me. Dammit.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hm? What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please. Leave. Now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. Ayumi won't talk to me anymore.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi isn't talking.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What's going on? Hm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's looking away.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like she doesn't want me to see.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's turned away and holding her clothes together.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Up until now, she's been with this bastard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to see this right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The way I feel seeing her like this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It just makes me upset.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit⋯ Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just looking at his face makes me furious.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What? Is there something on my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How dare that bastard make a comment like that!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of all people, he had to choose Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. I don't want to cause more trouble for Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But does this bastard really have any right to her?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You should think twice before you hit me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Did you stop and think about it before you hit me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You should know, law enforcement has really been cracking down on petty crime lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I didn't manage to kill you, it would still be worth trying.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You may not mind the trouble, but what would she do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The mother of a criminal would have a pretty tough life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You bastard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I really be looking over there right now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the living room. This is where Toyotomi and Ayumi were⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you looking at? I'm right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who would want to look at this bastard?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at this![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This photograph clearly shows Toyotomi and some gangsters meeting at the park at night.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]No way. It can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And why is that?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]There was no one around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You really are a fool. You just confessed.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ugh. What is that picture?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Are you going to claim it's an invasion of privacy or something?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hell no! I'll just do this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
*crumple*[%p]
*toss*[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hahaha! No more evidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fool.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think I didn't plan this out? That was just a copy. And I can easily make as many copies as I want.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Urgh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Leaking confidential information, coercion, theft, assault⋯ You won't get away with any of it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Admit it, Toyotomi. What you did was–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ha! Ahaha! Hahahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you crazy?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Get out of my way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! I won't let you get away![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, you⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. Fine. I don't know how you managed to get that picture, but I have to admit, you've caught me off guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You admitted it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, as long as I have the information I need, I don't need her anyway. You can have the woman you admire so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not about having her. Ayumi is not an object.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. I don't have time for this. It's just as well. We've only been delayed by a few hours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Say that again.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'll say it as many times as you need to hear it. She's a tool and nothing more. I'm not responsible for taking care of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The 20th page of the key is still difficult to decipher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But as long as I bring them the original, the company will welcome me with open arms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that all you have to say for yourself?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh no, there's more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ayumi should learn from my example.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't listen to this anymore!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line](Look here, Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hello.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kaori⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Listening to him made me cringe. I whacked him with an iron bar, but now I wonder if he's okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You whacked him with an iron bar?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ugh⋯ Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]He looks fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kaori⋯ Why?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That guy's a jerk. I had to do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But that's only partially true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Partially⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I had something to give you, but now I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something to give me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah. Remember I was taking pictures of his meeting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meeting⋯ The one he had with the gangsters at the park?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Correct. I have pictures of that. I hope it helps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, I⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why are you looking at me with that accusatory stare?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said not everything you do is for your own selfish gain⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah, well, this one is for my own gain. I only deal with corporate enterprises. I don't want to cause trouble for individuals.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But hitting this guy even once relieved a ton of stress.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now, go. I'll take care of this bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you gonna do?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll take the appropriate measures. As for you and your mother⋯ I won't cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's a point of pride for me. I did what I could, so I'll return those documents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you do that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Haha! Let's just say it's my secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You know you have the same eyes⋯ Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to go back to the living room, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi! Are you here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on? No one's answering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How's this?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Good. It works.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the one I found at Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You mean my office?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, on behalf of Geo Technics, please accept my gratitude for what you have found.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]This must be some kind of mistake. Or maybe it's someone working against Geo Technics⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You did this![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't be stupid. What would I gain by doing something that harms Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How dare that bastard make a comment like that!)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You got this from my office, so you must have been trespassing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But we'll talk about your culpability later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'll get the secret documentation back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]This belongs to the company, not you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. That document was hard to get. Now he's taking it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I do?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are better things I could be using right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use that.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No. Don't use that.)[%p]
