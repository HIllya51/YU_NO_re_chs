[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi should be at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to get in there, quick![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already late. Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already late. Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not in my nature to just sit around the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, where should I look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi might be back home. I better talk to her quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which reminds me⋯ I wonder where Ayumi went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure Ayumi isn't at home anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside of my home again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to clear up that misunderstanding quickly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi got called into Geo Technics by Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder about that⋯ You could say it's a bad feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it a bad idea to let Ayumi go alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't get into Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I could get inside if I had something to let me in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to find him fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For the time being, where should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just where was Ayumi called away to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside of my home again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry and give the medicine to Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*shiver* It sure is cold out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, a place that sells headache medicine, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I go home soon? Ayumi will worry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A picture of Ayumi. Why is this on the ground here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Toyotomi dropped it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would that asshole have a picture of Ayumi with him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy is more of a stalker than I expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Holding onto this won't help me, and Toyotomi's already gone. Darn, what do I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fully night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯is she back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry over to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi might be there![%p]
「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand, but that's what's written.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」 is what it says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some more writing⋯[%p]
「There are also other places where your 『Current Coordinates』 are noted, so please reference that as well.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sign. What does it say?[%p]
「This sign displays your current completion rate.」[%p]
「Your current junction discovery rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As much as humans destroy nature to put up man-made structures, they can't get away from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a strange connection we have with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants in my house, as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mailbox doesn't matter![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sexy fliers inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it would matter if there were. It'd just make me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, are there any fliers for video deliveries?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh! This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electricity bill. We have been using the AC lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, enter the house from the gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the gate. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a gated entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall doesn't matter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tiled wall. It's not made of bricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall that surrounds the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why do Japanese people want to surround everything with walls?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The spaces are small enough as they are, but everyone puts up walls. Making it even smaller.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the window. I should go in through the entrance instead![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna clean it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room's window is on the left, the right one is my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They might start getting dirty if we don't clean them soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antenna. I don't need that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A normal antenna. The TV signal isn't bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We need a satellite dish to get satellite TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The antenna for the local channels. It's still the age of analog broadcasting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I want to get into my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door's right there. I should hurry and go inside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect 「upper middle class」 house imagined by us middle class people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house where Ayumi and I live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dark night sky. Like it'll swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to be looking up at the night sky![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't waste time staring into space.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should go somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A clear blue sky with nice sunshine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, not a bad day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the time to look at that, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. I should hurry into the house![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. There's not many people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. Probably because the ocean is relatively close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the city in the distance. It's the only busy downtown area in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry into the house![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came from downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I'll try going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Mio is gonna just wander around downtown, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think there's anything for me downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll check it out anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think we missed each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she's not at Geo Technics, this is the only place where she should be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling about Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I just have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came back from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, if I want to go to a drugstore, I should go downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That place has everything from tissues to nuclear warheads.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, here I go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going downtown again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I think I should just go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go downtown![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown, huh. That's where that guy Toyotomi was headed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm lucky, I might see him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should give him that picture of Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, I feel dirty giving that asshole a picture of Ayumi, but I feel even dirtier keeping the picture he had.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know what I'm talking about. Anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you think I have the time to be strolling over to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline means construction. Construction makes me think of that creepy construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might run into that jerk. Fine, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, am I going back to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I have the time to go to there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics is on the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi still at work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is suffering from a headache. Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I have to do at the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's nothing for me to do at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In and out, what am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I have to hurry and see Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a bad feeling⋯ I have to see Ayumi right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I wanted to see Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be home by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the Geo Technics guard said something about Ayumi not answering the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That makes me worry⋯ I should just go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi still sleeping?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is suffering from a headache.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just left there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, Ayumi might be back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's head home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi should be home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should try going inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi's back at the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]School doesn't matter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm more worried about Ayumi right now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school, huh? Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's no reason to go to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the drug store's that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I thought I was going home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will ringing my own door bell accomplish?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going in the house, I should just walk in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit making me do such useless things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have other things to do.[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you happy now?[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
*ding dong*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it again for no reason.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, who is it?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](O-Oh no. Ayumi's home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll just keep quiet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I got away with it for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I ringing this anyway? Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang it for no reason.[%p]
