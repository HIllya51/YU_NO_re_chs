[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We start work right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right now?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. I have two things I need to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you won't tell me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll tell you. One thing is to get a certain document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Document?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's got nothing to do with you. It's something to do with your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of document is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's the formula to generate a liquid that preserves ore in its natural state.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It preserves ore?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup. When ore is dug from the ground as is, its physical properties can change dramatically. It might be to help prevent that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The document details how to make that liquid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It looks like you didn't know. It's your stepmother's own work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of ore can change states as soon as it's been dug up?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((The Hypersense Stone.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hyper what?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The Hypersense Stone. That's a different job, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you tell me about the other one?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sure thing. After all, we're partners now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What you need is the blue card, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What else do you want me to do?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you want to know why I need your help?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. What do you expect me to do?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't expect anything. I'm sorry, but I don't have time to depend on an amateur.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This is voluntary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I believe clean transactions are the basis of good business. And I enjoy the many benefits. You're valuable too, since you brought that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't change the subject. Are there any risks to this?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, yes. It'll be quite dangerous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And if something happens to you, I'll leave you behind. I assume you can look out for yourself. Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. It's a relief to hear that. It's so much better than empty promises.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay. Then let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't act dumb. We're going to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why did you bring me that blue card? There's only one place to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. I'm finally going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You don't have to come with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After I came all the way here? No, I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Good. You'll love it. Well, I'm going to take a shower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now I can go to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you using that blue card?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth could you know about it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You remind me of your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, did you⋯with the old bastard?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Only once⋯ Don't get angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You really did?! With that old bastard?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, but only once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unbelievable! I never expected that of someone like you, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why are you taking that tone? I was just curious about the difference between you and your father⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just curious? Geez![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Haha! Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What were you thinking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It seemed like you were thinking about something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was wondering how it's possible to be even sexier than you look.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're mean![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch! Don't pinch me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just saying what I thought.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're young.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't consider being young a problem. It's a matter of perspective.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Can you tell me about your father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, about Dr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't know why, but every time I mention your father, you get that look on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What look?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Like there's something stuck in your teeth that you can't get.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't know what she's talking about⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's with the face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you're asking about my bastard of a father.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What was he like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haven't you met him before? You told me you interviewed him.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A few times, yeah, but I don't think I've ever met the real man, ya know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I was wondering what he was like at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He always acted the same way.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want me to say?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whatever you wish to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was tough: he was a skeptic, a free thinker. Sometimes, he seemed like he wasn't thinking, but he could also be extremely smart, wonderful, and a funny guy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not great. He liked women, and he wasn't strict. So I got to do whatever I wanted.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The best way to describe him is as a poor man who abandoned his educational duties. A real bastard.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But you grew up so well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Children grow up and learn to recognize their parents' flaws as bad examples.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know anything.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heh. You wouldn't know it from looking at me, but I used to run child care programs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a newscaster. If your fans across the country knew, they'd be shocked.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're an idiot. My popularity is skyrocketing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should consider yourself a lucky man for having been with such a beautiful newscaster as myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't pinch me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I was interested in you, so I talked to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're interested in me? Why?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I have my reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are you trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This wasn't your first time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, obviously not![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I want to claim at least one guy's virginity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, I thought I might be your first time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It clearly wasn't your first time, but you're not exactly experienced either. The balance between the two was⋯exquisite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It was good, because you're inexperienced.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whoa, you're blushing. Heh. It makes me want to hug you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's too late to be a bad boy. Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting hard.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This beautiful newscaster is lying right next to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And she's completely naked, just as nature intended.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm fascinated with you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're nice.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'd like it if you stroked my hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Aren't you curious about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I mean⋯ It's beautiful.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ha! Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so silky. I can practically hear it shimmering in the light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a bit long.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, my eyes are up here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]By the way, you were too rough earlier.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I like it, but not all women do. Okay?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should be gentle with women.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We did a lot until just a while ago.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let's rest for a while. Okay?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm feeling kind of good.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should put it on your waist⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If I don't, I'll get anxious.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is that funny?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such beautiful, soft skin.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you looking at my skin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have such unexpectedly fair skin.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you mean unexpectedly? I don't go to tanning salons. I'm proud of my natural tone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such beautiful, soft skin.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I really like this room.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you curious about this room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How much does it cost a day?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, multiply your pocket money by three, add 500 dollars, and you'd be close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is a room in the hotel downtown.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Kaori lives here now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just think about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I going to use here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not a good time to do that.)[%p]
