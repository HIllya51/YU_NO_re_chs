[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been out of shape since I quit my club.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could I be out of breath after running such a short distance? That's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I made it in time. It's just before ten o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There, right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coast, quieter than ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no one working on construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline. Under construction, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where that lady in a tight outfit is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's you, Ayumi. What are you doing here? Well, that's a dumb question I guess.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I suppose I could say I'm here to inspect the construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Sounds tough.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't want to be the kind of boss that gives orders from their cozy little office, so I come out here to check up on things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a good attitude to have, but make sure you don't get hurt.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Tehehe, thank you.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey you! You can't just walk around here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Man[line]What do you think you're doing, trying to go in there without the construction director's permission?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the heck are you?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hmph, why don't I tell you just that? I am–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction director?[%p]
[name]Man[line]What?! How'd you know that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said so just a second ago.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, right. Whatever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this guy?)[%p]
[name]Man[line]As long as I'm in charge here, I won't let a single unauthorized person into where they don't belong.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If it isn't Chief Arima. I didn't know you were over here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Forgive me, this is my son.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You have a son, do you? I'm sure he's a wonderful lad.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Uh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Where is this son of yours now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, you're still here. This is a restricted area, now get lost.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He's my son. His name is Takuya.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Really? What a smart, good-looking son you have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what you just said.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Chief Arima, even if he is your son, without my permission he–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I'll tell him to go home right away.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Thank you, ma'am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry for all that trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was that moron?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But just look at the guy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That was Toyotomi. He's an employee of mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you mean he's Stupid Lackey A?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I said, don't say stuff like that. He gets the job done and is very helpful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Tehehe, could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid. It has nothing to do with him.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez. She always treats me like a kid.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish she wouldn't.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline. Under construction, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's still under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how long this construction is going to go on for.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you must be the girl that transferred the other day![%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remembered because the database in my head doesn't allow information on cute girls to be deleted.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're Kanna Hatano, right? You just transferred?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you remember me? We're in the same class.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I know you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nice, so you do remember me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I remember because you suddenly started undressing to welcome the new transfer student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. I guess that happened. What did you come here for?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm just taking a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A walk? Why don't I join you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She left. Hm, maybe that was too forward of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beautiful coastline looks miserable now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looked small from the rooftop and was hard to tell, but it's actually a very large-scale construction job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Expanding the building, huh? Does Geo Technics make that much money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish they'd reflect that amount of profits in Ayumi's bonus.[%p]
