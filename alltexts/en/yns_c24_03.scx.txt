[name]Takuya[line](This is more of a protest than a briefing⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those guys are getting agitated.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](People are holding banners and signs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They do look exactly like protesters.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There she is!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Over there. I see Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Everyone, please listen![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let me explain![%p]
[name]Man[line]There's no need to listen. Stop the construction immediately![%p]
[name]Man[line]That's right![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, they won't listen to what she's saying.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Stop the construction immediately![%p]
[name]Man[line]That's right![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I understand your feelings. But⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]If you understand, you should stop the construction right away![%p]
[name]Man[line]I heard lightning strike again, just a while ago![%p]
[name]Man[line]Making us work in such a place⋯ Are you guys trying to kill us?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please listen, everyone![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Geo Technics is providing higher safety standards than required with this construction work.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Then why did these accidents happen?![%p]
[name]Man[line]Yeah! Do you realize how dangerous it is?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We are aware. We have provided insulated clothes to all workers in the field to safely–[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Don't lie![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The accident occurred just a while ago! It just happened to cause less damage this time.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This woman tried to cause the accident on purpose.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah, you knew that accidents were happening frequently during transportation work. And you ordered it again![%p]
[name]Man[line]That's terrible. You did it on purpose?![%p]
[name]Woman[line]You have a cute face, but I won't be fooled![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I didn't know anything like that–[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Are you trying to escape responsibility?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I heard you're the chief executive of the site.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]W-Well, no, we're not⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Then it's your responsibility![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No⋯please listen.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Listen, everyone! My husband was wearing the safety insulation clothing that they provided at work. But then⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]He was killed by a lightning strike that occurred the day before yesterday![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, that was⋯an unexpected accident and–[%p]
[name]Woman[line]An unexpected accident?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Though lightning is electricity, it has a high voltage and even with an insulator there is still danger so–[%p]
[name]Man[line]Then you knew that people could die, but you were still letting them do the work?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Danger is inherent in this kind of work, and we are trying our best to–[%p]
[name]Man[line]You did your best but someone died![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]Is that really your best?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am sorry. There is no way I can apologize for the loss of the person.[%p]
[name]Man[line]We don't want your apology![%p]
[name]Woman[line]You murderer![%p]
*whack*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah! Please don't throw things![%p]
[name]Man[line]Give us a convincing explanation![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, s-stop⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Man[line]Explain it somehow![%p]
*whack*[%p]
*splash*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I-I'm sorry. I really don't know what to say to the family members left behind–[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I don't want you to say anything![%p]
*whack*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek! Please⋯stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn them!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're taking advantage of her, knowing that Ayumi won't fight back. Dammit!)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You devil![%p]
[name]Man[line]Say something![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]If all wrongs could be written off by an apology, we would not need the police.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Give me back my husband![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is Ayumi the only person out here from the company side?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're making Ayumi a scapegoat!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am really sorry⋯ Everything was my⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it, I can't take it anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off! That's enough![%p]
[name]Man[line]What?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so fun about bullying a woman by herself, huh?![%p]
[name]Man[line]What do you have to do with it? Get lost.[%p]
[name]Man[line]We are merely protesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Protesting? Give me a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A protest is to propose an opinion against unfair activity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What you're doing is ganging up on her and using violence![%p]
[name]Woman[line]You don't know how I feel⋯ My husband is dead![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry for your loss and for all the family members left behind.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Don't talk like you know everything![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Yeah! You don't know how I feel![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So if someone dies by an accident, it is okay to do anything you want? You, over there![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You threw things at her earlier, didn't you?![%p]
[name]Woman[line]I-I was⋯just⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if it hit her in the head? What would you do? If it hit her eyes and she went blind, what would you do?![%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the company that made the final decision.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your opponent isn't the woman there. Shouldn't you be protesting against the company, Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should take it to court or whatever, and protest in accordance with the law.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of all the things you could be doing, it's completely wrong to take your anger out on her![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're finally gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When they calm down a little, they'll realize how embarrassing their behavior was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's fun about bullying a woman, geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I need to help Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is terrible.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no. These papers are important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay. Nothing is missing. I'm relieved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those guys treated you terribly. They like to beat up those who don't fight back.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't talk like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]They are right, in a sense. I also think the company's misconduct is to blame.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that's⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know how to apologize to the bereaved family. I understand the sorrow of losing a loved one⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm glad you came to the rescue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just did what I had to do.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well⋯ To tell the truth, I was scared. I didn't know what to do⋯ I was about to cry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ Even though I have to be the tough one, you saved me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay? Can you stand up?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, I'm fine. They just threw some eggs, nothing hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, if I see them again, I won't let them get away with this.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You mustn't talk like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't worry, I'm okay. Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey you! You there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he showing up just now?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Outsiders should not be here. Come on, the briefing is over. Go on home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Are you all right, chief? Geez. I was also caught in the protest. Hence why I couldn't make it here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey come on⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's not making any sense with what he's saying. This guy.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey you, outsiders should leave now. Go, goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you stop it already.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you so much. I'm okay now that Toyotomi is also here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This bastard is–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well now Chief Arima, maybe you can change your clothes inside the company. Can I carry those papers for you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No thank you. I'll carry them myself.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]All right. Geez. They were terrible. They've misunderstood natural disasters as human disasters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You bastard.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You have a TV shoot tonight. Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, that's fine. Let's go to the TV station at 7pm as scheduled. That's our job.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]All right then, here you go. Are you okay? Let me help you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, this bastard is–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well then, Takuya. I will be back before it gets late. Wait for me, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi, pick up those signs and things please.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Okay, I will.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, Takuya. I'll be back early, so stay home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get it but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, what's with that guy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't that accident happen because of that bastard anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi was trying to cover him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯what's up with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told me to stay home because she'll be coming home early.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't he say something earlier?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About her having a TV shoot at 7pm tonight or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Television⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Looks like there's nothing I can do here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go back to the coastline for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi isn't hanging on the tree⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah right. When did Ayumi become a cicada?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi isn't stuck to the wall.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's search elsewhere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she'd be stuck to the wall like a gecko.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel kinda better about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a bunch of grass there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You can only find insects in the grass, so that's not the place to look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They've written some sort of protest message on their outfits.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's so many different things written.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Say NO to construction. Apologize now.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a common message of protest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The basics of protest rallies, the so-called banner.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](By the way, it's not a flag like every country has.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That looks like it just says, 「NO!」 on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「NO!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's really simple. Just 「NO」 huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it says, 「Mercy for the bereaved family!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Mercy for the bereaved family!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's true⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](People were killed by the lightning strike.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I can't see that sign very well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「No you fool, that's my belly button.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be funny if it said that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't really see from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics should get out of Sakaimachi!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Geo Technics should get out of Sakaimachi!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The local residents' opposition is steaming up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「The company should stop the construction, immediately!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「The company should stop the construction, immediately!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do they use so many exclamation marks?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「The mayor's embezzling public funds. We demand an explanation!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's see.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「The mayor's embezzling public funds. We demand an explanation!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know it's gone that far.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew, I'll have to watch today's News Presence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I should focus on Ayumi now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where could she possibly be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's so fun about licking the transwoman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I licked her so many times. Damn.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I just want to let you know that I'm a transwoman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I swear I'll never do it again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I need to look for Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*lick lick*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want my lips to swell up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*lick*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to the original path.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can't push it, try pulling it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can't lower it, raise it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. It's crowded. Whoa![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, I'm sorry. It's crowded and I slipped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She really didn't have to kick me like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't have time to be doing this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know that Ayumi's here, somewhere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So crowded. Oh, I slipped.[%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The s-skirt won't go down.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, by the way, the skirt is attached to my one piece dress.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I probably shouldn't be thinking about that right now.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I disagree![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Come on, raise your voice and⋯ Wait, where are you going?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, did you just get here?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Come on, raise your voice and claim opposition![%p]
[name]Woman[line]What? You just came to watch?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Are you going to forgive the way Geo Technics handles everything?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]People complained to stop the construction, but they've been ignoring it.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Did you see the lightning strike at the construction site just a while ago? That was horrible.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Don't tell anyone that I'm just here 'cuz I want lunch, okay?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You're asking if I know Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Braided hair and glasses⋯ Oh, she's the woman in charge of the construction.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]She was here just a while ago, but I don't see her anymore because of this crowd. Isn't she coming out soon?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]But I don't really know about these things.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Well, I've heard there's a corruption case involving the mayor, so it doesn't look like a legit company.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What? Me?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I joined the protest because they give out a big lunch box to participants.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]They even bus you here, and you get a free lunch.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Huh, who pays for the lunch?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I don't know. But I think the bus that brought us here was from the TV station.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Geo Technics, get out of Sakaimachi![%p]
[name]Woman[line]I⋯ I lost my husband in the accident.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]This wouldn't have happened if they had stopped construction after the first accident.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]The company kept telling us it would be safe, and I can't stand it anymore![%p]
[name]Woman[line]Huh? Do I know where Ayumi is?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, Chief Arima who's in charge of construction, I suppose.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]She's over there. You should go criticize her, too.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Please stop⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]I hurt too much to raise my voice in protest.[%p]
[name]Man[line]H-Hey, what are you doing? What?[%p]
[name]Man[line]There was a cicada on me this time?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hahaha⋯ Thanks again.[%p]
[name]Man[line]That woman, Chief Arima, should be thrown in jail.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Whoa, wh-why are you trying to hit me?! There's no bug anymore![%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, it was a grasshopper this time?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hahaha⋯ Thank you.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I just want to drag that awful Chief Arima down from there.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, there was a mosquito on me?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Wow, thank you so much.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Look at my sash.[%p]
[name]Man[line]「Bow Down in the Dirt Chief Arima!」 What do you think?[%p]
[name]Man[line]That chief thinks she's great because she's kinda pretty.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Gotta show cats like that the fist of anger–[%p]
[name]Man[line]Wh-Why are you showing me your fists?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, it was a fruit fly this time?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, thanks. That kind of hurt though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I heard Ayumi's voice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is she?)[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Listen up, everyone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Ayumi's voice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where? Where is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She should be somewhere in this crowd.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are even people criticizing her personally in there, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is against this construction, damn it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everyone is criticizing Geo Technics.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's truly a group of men and women of all ages.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are all these people against the construction?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are so many people.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And they've got blood in their eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is more of a protest than a briefing⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't look like she's there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on, she wouldn't be over there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not the time to use that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How do you want me to use that item?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is more important now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. It's not the time to use that.)[%p]
