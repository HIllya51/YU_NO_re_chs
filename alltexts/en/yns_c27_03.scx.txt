[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did I hear that scream come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. Nothing interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A utility pole. Having fun looking at it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's Mio's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not where I heard the scream come from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard the scream from the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, it's right over the guardrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I didn't hear the scream from that far away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I hear a voice over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to search carefully.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to find whoever was screaming, and fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't hear any screams from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it was over there, in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard the scream from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you curious about that scream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't use that item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you have something better to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! I can't use that there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just give it some more thought.[%p]
