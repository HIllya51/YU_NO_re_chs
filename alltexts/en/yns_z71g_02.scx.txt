[name]Takuya[line]There's no one here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind has died down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only light. I should use it to proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The way forward is completely blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I saw this the last time I was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The path is straight ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, it's completely blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means this isn't the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The right side is blocked by a boulder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was the same last time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's a path on the right side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, shit. This can't be the right place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess I'll go back⋯[%p]
