[name]Takuya[line]It's an underground passage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are passageways to the front and to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet⋯ I'm getting goose bumps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet my voice echoes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's letting off a dim light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not even that huge earthquake could cause this place to collapse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, you can never be too careful. So that's just what I'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I should go forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The right side is blocked by a boulder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's a path on the right side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back.[%p]
