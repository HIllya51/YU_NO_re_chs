[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a complete mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did I hear that voice come from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's unlocked, but I need to find out where that scream came from first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this by myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But man, it really seems like a monster or something could jump out at any second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold, dark, and–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhh![%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ohoho⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp* *wheeze* You scared the shit out of me![%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Aren't you a handsome young man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I like someone else, lady.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ohoho, don't you worry. I won't be snatching you away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Thank you for before, young man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]You protected me. I appreciate it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I protected you?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]You seem interested in this storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]It's actually a replica of one that had been built there 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯what?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]There's a deep well in the back on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Allow me to give you something nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Can't you tell? It's a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I can see that. What's it for though?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ohohoho, that's⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Oh, it looks like you already have it. That's my key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your key⋯?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You showed up again?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Hehehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's go inside. It's cold at night.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, this is?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ohohoho, farewell, young man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You were saying something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, actually.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I tell him about the key?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My gut instinct is that I probably shouldn't.)[%p]
Give the key
Don't give the key
[name]Takuya[line](Right. I can't just take something that isn't mine.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should give it back to Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]This is the key to the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ Someone gave it to me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph, my mother's always had a habit of giving away household items. I'll take that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, um⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's back in its rightful owner's hands. It has nothing to do with me now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why did that old lady give it to me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe this key has some kind of deeper meaning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My gut is telling me I shouldn't give it to Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is something the matter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's nothing. She didn't say anything to me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. Fine. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, that should do it.)[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Golden Key][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Golden Key][color index="800000"].
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, seeing as you're on your way out⋯ I'll walk you outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He doesn't want to see me out. I'll bet he wants to kick me out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This storehouse is half destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not particularly strange. It's just a wreck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's much larger than usual, which means it takes a lot more work to maintain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's just as Ryuuzouji said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He lives alone with his mother, so I guess it's only natural things ended up this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls are really damaged.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one has done any maintenance on this storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, this is probably the strange storehouse Mitsuki was talking about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing is badly damaged, an eyesore really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what's so strange about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a copse of trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the greenery around here is from the copse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The moon is out, shedding a little light on this area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dark night sky. It looks like it could swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this atmosphere, it's no wonder people talk about this place being cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like something could pop out at me any second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to find out who was calling to me first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I haven't found the owner of that voice yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They have to be somewhere around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to find out where that voice came from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, I said. I have to find out where that voice came from.[%p]
