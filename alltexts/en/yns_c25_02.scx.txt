[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko, but what is she wearing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get it already. It's just a coincidence that both you and Ryuuzouji are here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, that's exactly right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were so cute when you were sleeping in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Whaa⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's Abel?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can't hear you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Abel.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Who?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A. Bel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem. Hey, if it isn't Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing–mrph![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shh! Be quiet or they might hear you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh. I let that one slip.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You are hopeless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry, I have some urgent business.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What urgent business did she have? Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that woman named Kaori left at some point, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is following them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why on earth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just go outside for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for before.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You gave me some advice at the drugstore earlier, right? I came to thank you for that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hahaha, how polite of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had no idea that was you, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And I didn't think you'd come chase me down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The more I look at her, the more I'm surprised at how she looks so different.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I uh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now that you mention it, you're right. It definitely looks like the headmaster. What a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, don't give me that look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you at least tell me why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sure. So every night–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop! I want the real reason. And why are you dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't you know? A wise man hides the leaf in the forest, and the rock in the riverbanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to say you're blending in dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is something funny?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, you really stand out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh. I guess there's room for improvement.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Ryuuzouji over there?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm sure the headmaster has his own reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So? Are you saying it's a total coincidence that you're here at the same time as Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why would you say that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were just looking over there.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was staring into space. He happened to be where I was looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish she would take this seriously⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here, dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is it weird⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, but I heard this kind of outfit is pretty popular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then what is the problem?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is I don't know why you're here, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, well, it's a long story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like you're out on the town.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, actually⋯when night comes, I want a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, that's a good enough reason. So every night I walk the streets hunting for men. Satisfied?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Normally I'd just believe you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You suspect me for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so elusive.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Umm, who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I never would've thought⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is there something on my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, uh⋯ You look way different.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My hair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]People change a lot depending on whether or not their eyes are hidden by their hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not what I mean⋯well, kinda, I guess.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her she looks pretty, it'll go straight to her head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know Ms. Eriko was this pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is beating faster⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair always covered her face⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's smiling at me, but she looks insincere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've seen this face before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But, Ms. Eriko's cigarette⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes I wonder if she's always puffing the same cigarette.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry to bother you with my smoking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I don't care.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Still don't care?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko, I knew it.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, I can't believe this is how you knew it was me. That was a pretty big blind spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I think of Ms. Eriko, I think of cigarettes. It's like a conditioned reflex now.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm. I guess that's a subject for later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A subject?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A nice body with a cigarette in hand⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A cigarette?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman with a nice body that smokes? That's just like⋯)[%p]
Eriko
Ryuuzouji
Me
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯ Obviously not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Ryuuzouji could become a woman as hot as this, I could be Elizabeth Taylor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmmm, hmmm⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]D-Do you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's me, Takuya! Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not quite right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmmm. Hmmmm.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]D-Do you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh!!![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯ Is that you?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]M-My name isn't Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I said I'm not Eriko⋯*mumble mumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you mumbling about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wild night life of the school physician⋯ That would make quite a headline.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, here's the thing, I guess that's okay, yeah. How's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm saying this is just between us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But man, look at Ms. Eriko.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's changed a lot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think that's someone's trademark⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wh-What do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? I've seen that cigarette before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bangs aren't in the way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks totally different.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always keep it down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look totally different just by putting your bangs up a little.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That was my intention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her intention?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That flowing hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair reminds me of someone⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, Ms. Eriko will make fun of me again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Alas, it's the sad nature of men to still be interested⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're always the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I uh, I was just thinking those clothes are a nice color.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Thank you, hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. She sees right through me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen protuberances like that before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a joke.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how many inches⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a secret.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey⋯ You're too obvious with your face so close to my chest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I am short-sighted.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, it's your fault for dressing like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is that so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like you're telling me to look. Geez, do you enjoy stimulating the uncontrollable libido of men?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't remember telling you not to look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? So it's okay if I look?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]On second thought, it's not okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I'm so close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk about a dangerous situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I dare say, I love a dangerous situation.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't resist that rack⋯ Stop it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe this caf⑮. The cup is stuck to the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I can't see that part of you, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrrn⋯ Ugghh⋯ Agghh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, this cup is in my way. Hrrn, grr, ahh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! I can't get it off.[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Yeah, it's stuck there with glue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's ridiculous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out of my way, nuisance![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waitress, take this cup away![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*burp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmmm⋯ This is a little rough.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're gonna be okay⋯right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing should be⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Gah![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's my coffee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waitress, take this cup away![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My coffee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, this time⋯)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]I brought your refill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What is wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm angry because she's getting in the way of my manly needs.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, dang it. Guess I'll keep on trying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, that shadow tickles a man's curiosity⋯)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]I brought your refill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeey![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A-Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grr⋯ Gimme a break!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hrm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That dangerous shadow tickles a man's curiosity.)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you yelling about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kinda happy⋯but this isn't the time to be looking there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crossing her legs under a glass table⋯that makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crossing her legs under a glass table⋯that makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The question is what's Ms. Eriko doing here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her dress and behavior are so nice⋯and young.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But where⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sugar and salt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put a bunch of sugar in my mouth, and then slowly add salt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What'll happen then?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you like one?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can't do anything with the whole bottle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's sugar and salt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course, I don't need them now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are a bunch of butts in the ashtray.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Judging by the cigarette butts, you've been here for a few hours.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I smoke three at a time, so you can't make that assumption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you⋯put three in your mouth at once?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An ashtray.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman with a nice body and an ashtray. That reminds me of something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'd like to give some money to whoever invented this table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They really understood a man's mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you pressing your face against the table?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I thought it looked a little dirty.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it okay for it to be so see-through?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course it is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's one of those foliage plants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Photosynthesis makes it a nice color.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see Ryuuzouji and Kaori on the other side of the shrub.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko was watching them⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji and that lady named Kaori are sitting on the other side of the shrub.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like Ms. Eriko was watching them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shrubs. They're foliage plants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko's earrings.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm not going to give them to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Some bling, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I remember seeing this personality somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is sitting right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm inside the Evening Caf⑮.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
