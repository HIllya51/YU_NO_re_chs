[name]Kaori[line]Heehee, peeking from the shadows? That wasn't a very racy scene though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, I'm caught.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with a very slight grin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful, but I don't know if I can trust her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's hard to say. It's like she's so modern⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is cute, but I think she might be older than me.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I think your mother is admitting that the company was at fault, though maybe not entirely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]However, it's causing great conflict in her heart. Am I right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say? Out with it already.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you're sharp. I just wanted to warn you about something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]First, peeping isn't nice. Have some self respect.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anything else?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't give me a bad attitude, young man. Now listen up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I tried interviewing Dr. Arima several times when he was alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, he was an interesting man. Oh, I don't mean to patronize the dead. I have the best intentions saying that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What Geo Technics is trying to do is based on Dr. Arima's theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man's theories?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]To be honest, I'd like to see Mrs. Arima, your stepmother, take her exit soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take her exit? What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I mean, take her exit from this stage, Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't mean to hurt her in anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can she say that?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your stepmother is involved in a very serious situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it that bad?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you tell me that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Because I feel like you'd be on her side. She's isolated at her company. She's struggling alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should watch out for that Toyotomi guy. He'll start to make his move soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is getting wrapped up in something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And be careful of Toyotomi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is she, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she really just a regular old news anchor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just to let you know, Ayumi never had a PhD.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's not who I'm talking about. I'm referring to Dr. Arima, your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ayumi Arima is not blood related to you, and your real mother died when you were very young. Is that about right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it the job of news anchors to investigate family histories nowadays?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, so you remembered me. That makes me so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, there's no way I could forget it. You harassed her on TV where she couldn't do anything to defend herself.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Right. I see you're talking about the interview last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I only asked the questions the viewers wanted answered. Isn't finding the cause to an accident urgent business?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People in the media always say that. They act all justified hiding behind the public's prying curiosity.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There is no superiority in reporting information. All that remains is the undeniable truth of it all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're just trying to stir up trouble. That doesn't seem like something the media should be doing.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Stirring up trouble requires prying at people's emotions. I think last night's interview was very logical.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Did you watch the whole thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not the beginning.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So honest. I like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could be lying. Maybe I did see the whole thing from beginning to end.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then you would have said you didn't watch it at all, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could have said I only watched some of it to make it more believable. You did believe my answer, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No. The fact that I knew you weren't lying had nothing to do with what you said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're Dr. Arima's son, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dr. Arima?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so shiny it looks like it might sparkle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her mid-length hair is beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although⋯ I'm very curious to see what's going on inside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should know the answer to that though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoops.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you want to see, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there goes a breeze. *peek*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. You're very forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just kidding⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're very direct, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, being so straightforward is good once in a while I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa. That's a pretty bold outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't keep myself from staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry, but I can't give you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never said I wanted it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she likes shiny stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Fashionable clothes and shiny jewelry. A very mature combination.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't she get cold with her stomach exposed that much?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No use worrying about that though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to rub my cheeks against that beautiful navel of hers. And then lick her⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Psh. Not even in my dreams.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you laughing about all of a sudden? You're so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling she's being provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's that kind of pose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are provocative hands, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful, but I don't know if I can trust her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said her name was Kaori Asakura.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder just what kind of woman she really is?)[%p]
