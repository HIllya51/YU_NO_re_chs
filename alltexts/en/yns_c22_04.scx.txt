[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remember what Mio said⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「If my theory is correct, it begins here.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could she have meant by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth could be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Mio was really looking into this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could be here though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth could be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't try to read the letters, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I to do without reading them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stone slab Mio was examining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not really a natural stone slab. It's as if someone cut a flat surface onto it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it the night before last?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a woman passed out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking about it now, I guess that happened two nights ago⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman⋯
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, this is also where I met that woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could something be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll open it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A towel and a change of clothes. There's a flashlight and a compass, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going on a trip somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A trip? No, it's more like an expedition or something of that sort⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An expedition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could this be Mio's?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would Mio's bag be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember Yuuki saying something about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「If my theory is correct, it begins here.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, Mio said something like this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if she left her bag here, then where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I shouldn't jump to conclusions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a fact that this is Mio's bag.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I know right now is that someone's bag is here, and what's inside it makes it look like they packed for some kind of trip.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I should leave this here for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone really might have just left it here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bag behind this rock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Behind the rock?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's a bag of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The real question is, why is it here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rock looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if it isn't Mio's, it sure has me curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's there?! Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's dangerous to be here. Please leave right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dangerous? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The lightning striking along the coastline is dangerous. That's what I mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What on earth is she doing here, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please, I beg you. Arima, please leave this place now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's like a passing breeze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I found a bag that probably belongs to Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should meet up with Yuuki and exchange info.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where were we supposed to meet again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Mio is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Reminds me of the time I was waiting for my old man to appear⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feels like it's a little cold, but maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should meet up with Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think there are any more clues around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look into this more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I look around here a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check if Mio is here or not.[%p]
