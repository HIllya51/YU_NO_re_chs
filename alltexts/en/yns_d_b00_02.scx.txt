[name]Yuuki[line]So now what do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what we should do⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish I could ask someone for help⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hard and heavy boulder⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's impossible⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This won't work. I can't move it at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened to Mitsuki. Is she still outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Miiitsuukiiii!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe she went to call for help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm, I don't mean to be pushy, but I have a suggestion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, out with it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How about we wait here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And abandon Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can stay here by yourself if you want.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go with you. It's my fault after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Oh well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I really be looking at this rock?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a weathered rock⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Your facial skin is pretty rough too, Boss Man. D-Don't look so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. All we can do is move forward.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are we going back inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
