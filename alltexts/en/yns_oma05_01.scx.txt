[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I've never been able to visit this place at this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I able to do so now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how many times I look, I still can't climb it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. It holds electric cables in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I say the same thing every time I look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see it from here, but I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top one says, 「Stop」 and the bottom one says, 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's also true that looking at green makes you feel calm and relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these plants are here almost apologetically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guardrail is tough enough to take a hit from a car.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some bad guys live over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never knew that before⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A traditional Japanese house with lots of nature around it. What a place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sparrows in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sparrows like to rest up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're stretched all around like spider webs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the kind of paving you'd want to sprawl out on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really cold right now. Makes me want to lie down on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school isn't very tall, but it's on a large property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd take a while to walk all the way around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this type of construction is called an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior design is actually pretty nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Sakaimachi Academy, the school I attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking about it now, maybe Sakaimachi got its name because it borders another world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, enough of that deep thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring up at the sky like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's around. It's nighttime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I guess I'll go back to the regular route.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You listening? If I go home I'll be going back to the regular route.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, why am I going back to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like now is the only time I can come here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I guess I'll go back to the regular route.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I remember correctly, there's an electrical lock in place at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came all the way here. Might as well go inside.[%p]
