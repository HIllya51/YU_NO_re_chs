[name]Takuya[line]It's the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ms. Eriko's up to no good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not ten o'clock yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna wants to give me something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't lend her any money. And I didn't ask her to do anything for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what this is about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ms. Eriko? Are you done yet?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just another minute. Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you so worried about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, excuse me! My hips aren't exactly small.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And this dress is⋯ Hrgh! This dress is tight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't get it off?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't need to shout it. It's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the one who said it. Want me to give you a hand?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not a chance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is changing over near the bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way she goes out on the town like that every night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm more and more intrigued.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you say something? Hrgh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough hrgh-ing already![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, these clothes are just⋯ Hrgh! They're unexpectedly⋯ Hrgh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry up. I'm gonna piss myself.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Go right ahead. I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Smokestack! Hurry up and get outta there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh man. Never there when it counts. Shit.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're at the infirmary. Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no⋯ She's passed out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Whoa! Was that an earthquake?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a pretty big one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the fire alarms aren't going off, so I guess we're okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear a beeping coming from the main hall. Everyone is pretty shaken up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An earthquake in the middle of the day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess time of day doesn't really matter when it comes to earthquakes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. I forgot about Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to put her on the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew! Piggybacking someone all the way from the coast sure takes a lot of effort.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seemed as light as a bird at first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Climbing up those hills from the coast though⋯ Whew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here. I guess I have to take care of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Busy, eh? Whether you're busy or not, I'm coming back soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she's already gone.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm pretty busy with all this paperwork. If I don't get this done soon⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you don't get it done soon, what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I won't have time for my walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I hear you right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounded like you just said you wanted time for a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you seem busy, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whether you're busy or not, I'm coming back soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as usual⋯wait.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe she was actually here.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you look like your hemorrhoids are flaring up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck are hemorrhoids?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know, there can be things in your rectum that–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay! You don't have to get into the details.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh really. That's too bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with her?)[%p]
