[name]Takuya[line]Why is she on at this time of day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((⋯just learning about the investigation. Mayor Shimazu, the prime suspect⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's about Mio's father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should listen.[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((Around noon today, Mayor Shimazu stated that he would be resigning.))[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((The council plans to freeze all construction assistance to Geo Technics.))[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((Furthermore, they plan to investigate whether incidents similar to this one have occurred in the past.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((Again, Mayor Shimazu has stated that he intends to resign.))[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((The council plans to freeze all construction assistance to Geo Technics.))[%p]
[name]Female Caster[line]((Furthermore, they plan to investigate whether incidents similar to this one have occurred in the past.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mayor is resigning, and they're stopping Geo Technics construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is exactly what Mio said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's she going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess she'll study abroad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi, you're home.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm glad I found you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look busy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, I guess I am rather busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you off to work again?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I have to go right back to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry. I'll be late again today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Work is work. What can you do?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I might not be able to come home tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I'm used to it now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry. I'm not being a very good mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's okay. I'm not a kid, so it's fine.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'm doing what I'm supposed to.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you go to your remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I uh⋯ Yeah, I did.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to worry about anything, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right. Sorry. I'll make this up to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to apologize.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay. I'll be back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What happened last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You snuck out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, ha⋯ D-Did I?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I waited for you until morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm not mad at you for sneaking out. But I want to know where you went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm, last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her I stayed at Mio's, Ayumi might just faint.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll have to cover it with a bit of a white lie.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have a friend named Yuuki. I stayed at his place.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she gonna buy that?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right. Just do your best to tell me ahead of time from now on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure⋯ I will.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]See you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I feel bad about lying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, you might not like the truth, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is tough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's company, Geo Technics, is in trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The TV is still on. Doesn't that bother you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to look at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to watch TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The TV is still on. Doesn't that bother you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to watch TV.[%p]
