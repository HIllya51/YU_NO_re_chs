[name]Takuya[line]This is the school's lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason, Ayumi is here. Let's talk to her.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This isn't much of a coincidence, I guess. You go to school here, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah. Right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Were you called here, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not really sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm down. Just calm down, Takuya.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, Takuya. Don't make me worry about you so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. There's nothing to worry about.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'm not very confident, and I'm not sure, either.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That makes no sense, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I just can't seem to remember.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It just happens so often I can't remember if it really did happen this time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! Ayumi, are you okay? I was just kidding![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't get upset. It's fine, I don't think anyone's mad at me. It's no big deal.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You always say that, but it always ends up a big deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's outrageous. I've always been a man of my word.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your expression looks like it's calling me a big, fat liar.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Isn't it true? I mean, take the other day, for example.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do you remember what happened when we sung the school anthem at the school opening ceremony?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you mean when I changed it out for a porn audio tape?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes! I was so embarrassed I thought I would die![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! That was pretty funny though, you gotta admit. Laughter makes the heart grow bigger.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks to you, I got yelled at by the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, did you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If you don't feel bad for doing that, then I don't know what to do as your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What to do as my stepmother?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My⋯stepmother?)
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-Why are you looking so serious all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just that⋯ Yeah, I do regret it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get my act together, don't I? Sorry I caused you trouble.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's⋯okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't think of it as trouble. It's a stepmother's job to support her stepson, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's completely switched up her stance on this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting tough⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Anyways, it looks like the person who called you here hasn't shown up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I wonder what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you know something?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We have the same last name, don't we?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Of course, we're family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the problem.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm trying to say, maybe it was you who was called here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Me? By whom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know, but didn't you need to see the headmaster about something?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school physician Ms. Eriko told me. If I had gotten called here, I doubt I'd get off scot-free.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, that's why I think it was more likely that you were the Arima called here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I get it⋯ I just thought you were in trouble again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Again? Well, I guess you're not wrong.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, I need to talk to him about the potential construction expansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction expansion, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Must be about the stuff going on at the coastline.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I wonder why he'd call for me over the P.A. though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, we still don't know who was called.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're talking about the construction on the coastline, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. It's supposed to be for an expansion to the office building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Supposed to be? So what is it really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's really what it is. Our plan is to survey the land for an expansion to the office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's fine putting up a new building, but it would be bad news if it ended up like the Leaning Tower of Pisa or worse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have a point there.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's what the survey is for. It should be finished in a few days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that your job right now?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, I'm supposed to be in charge of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're the director at the construction site?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. I'm the design director. Someone else is the construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is everything really all right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, do you have the phrase 「refrain from asking」 in your dictionary, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's not nice. The newspapers were going on and on about that lightning incident.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be too late if something happens to you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you worried about me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯we're family after all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks, but I'm okay. I'm going to have the workers wear insulated clothing so nothing like that happens again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]And about the soil transportation⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Glad to see you could make it, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya&Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, that's right. Both of your last names are Arima. I was calling Ayumi over the P.A.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously? I'm almost disappointed.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're Koudai's son, right? Your name was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]My, how you've grown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nice to meet you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I remember you and your father came to visit me when you were about two years old⋯which means this isn't the first time we've met.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's the first time for me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Long time no see, Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, long time no see, Ayumi. I haven't seen you since college, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. You were always so nice to me back then.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I haven't seen you since you married Koudai⋯ I mean Dr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You know where I live, right? My house is very close to the school.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, I heard you moved in just two months ago. I'll have to stop by for a visit some time.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Certainly. I'm glad to see you're doing well.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm sorry for what happened to Koudai⋯ Dr. Arima. I read about it in the newspaper.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]He was my research partner and my best friend. We lost a precious soul.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]We spoke over the phone, but is there anything that he⋯or she left behind?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, nothing that was addressed to you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It doesn't have to be addressed to me specifically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh! What's wrong, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My throat's all messed up lately. *cough*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Man, he really doesn't like to mince his words.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Try practicing a little modesty sometime, eh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it seems like I wasn't called here, so I'll be leaving.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'd like to sit down and talk with you some time, Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we get the chance, sure. I can't guarantee anything since lots of problems have been building up lately.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you know if Koudai left anything behind?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be going now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, I might get home late tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I figured. You're so busy lately⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry. I'll be home as soon as I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who called for me though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi and I are the only ones here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you get called here too, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can tell by the look of this place that it's just a teachers' hangout spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here but Ayumi and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unfortunately, this is my stepmom. She makes herself look a lot younger though.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I think I'm still pretty young age-wise, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's about 10 years older than me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course, she's just my stepmother. If she weren't, that would mean she had me when she was a child.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's always shamelessly smiling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life can't be fun every second of the day.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh man⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop, Ayumi is watching.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're not related by blood, but I still shouldn't be staring at her breasts⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So stop it!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uhh⋯ Your shirt is such a pretty color. Yeah, it looks good on you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You think so? I spent so long picking this out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I haven't seen the person who called me here yet.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I wonder which one of us were called here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't we wait a little longer?[%p]
