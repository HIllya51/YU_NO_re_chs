[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a bell ringing in my head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ring, ring⋯ It's loud.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯ That time, I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's wrong⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My body is numb⋯ It won't move.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ Argh!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can just barely twitch my fingers⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like I'm paralyzed.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Looks like he's awake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That voice⋯ It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryu-Ryuusoohi, hoo⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I used a very strong sedative. You won't be able to move for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha doous aah meea?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You don't have to talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It seems you've been sniffing around quite a bit.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You don't know where the Reflector is, do you? It wasn't among Koudai Arima's research papers⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It seems you're still unaware of your circumstances.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You are in my home, and you are tied to a table so you can't move.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. Regardless, I plan to find that Reflector someday.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know where it is, but I will find it.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]This will save me the trouble of starting from scratch.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, you look sick. Why don't I help you on your way to peaceful sleep?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's all right. It shouldn't hurt.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Close your eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Noooo![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Keep your eyes closed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My eyes are so heavy⋯)[%p]
I closed my eyes like a baby listening to a lullaby.[%p]
My entire body was pulled into darkness. I was surrounded by the feeling of floating.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll give you a shot of medication to help you relax⋯[%p]
I wanted to say I didn't want a shot, but I couldn't speak.[%p]
I heard the clanking sound of some kind of metal tools hitting each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This wasn't how it was supposed to be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this is where I⋯ Damn it.)[%p]
As I lost consciousness, I made one last-ditch attempt to move my arms and legs.[%p]
That's when I felt something solid at my fingertip.[%p]
In my dream, I pressed that thing with my finger.[%p]
It seems like I didn't belong in this world⋯[%p]
