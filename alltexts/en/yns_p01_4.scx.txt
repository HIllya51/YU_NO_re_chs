[name]Takuya[line]I have something to do before I go to Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll read the whole thing again.[%p]
“To my dear, underachieving son⋯”[%p]
“If it turns out that you have as brilliant a mind as I do, then one day, you will most certainly unravel the complicated threads of history as I have.”[%p]
“And that means a new end and new beginning for all of mankind.”[%p]
“But what is the true meaning of history? Have you ever considered that, Takuya?”[%p]
“I once thought history was a record of the changes that occur as the past moves to the present.”[%p]
“I thought that it was the record and shape of the changes and fluidity of human society.”[%p]
“At least, that's what I thought until now.”[%p]
“Historians like us believe our study of history is important, that the time we dedicated to it was well spent. And so we continued researching, wasting every day.”[%p]
“But let's make a different assumption. What if the path from the past to the present weren't just a one-way road?”[%p]
“What exactly is history? The record of changes in mankind?”[%p]
“No, that is nothing more than a record of certain things happening at certain times. That is not history.”[%p]
“The flow of time is not an irreversible phenomenon. You must understand that it is a reversible concept.”[%p]
“So does that mean history can repeat itself?”[%p]
“Not quite. History is an irreversible concept. The difference here is both miniscule and enormous.”[%p]
“When I made that discovery, I decided to go to a certain place.”[%p]
“History can't be repeated, but the flow of time is reversible.”[%p]
“By the time you read this, I'll be long gone. However, this doesn't mean I am dead.”[%p]
“You should see two items in front of you. One is a mirror, and the other is a device with a very specific purpose.”[%p]
“The mirror is a keepsake left by your mother, Keiko. The strong connection between you and your mother ties you to that place.”[%p]
“And the other device⋯ The instructions are inside the second drawer from the top.”[%p]
“Alone, this device can create enough energy to reverse approximately twelve hours. The main unit is separate.”[%p]
“Make sure there are ten jewels set in it⋯”[%p]
“⋯and go to the foot of Sword Cape at ten o'clock tonight. Someone will be waiting there for you.”[%p]
“Hand the device to that person. There you shall understand everything.”[%p]
“Do not tell Ayumi about this. Make sure you go alone.”[%p]
“She must not find out about it. Not yet. But at some point, I'm sure I will tell her about it.”[%p]
“Let that responsibility rest with me.”[%p]
“You must be very careful. If there are not ten jewels in that device, there is no point.”[%p]
“If there are not⋯”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. It's about time I gathered my thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a strange mirror.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I shouldn't worry too much about the mirror now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to finish reading his letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This mirror reflects my face in a distorted shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The real question is, why is it here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who sent such a thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mirror⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It actually looks like that bronze mirror in history textbooks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bronze mirror?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not really bronze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see my own reflection in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want a moment to think right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does this weird thing have to do with that old bastard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A weird thing. That's all I can call it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so hard, but isn't heavy at all. Some kind of glass beads set in it as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are glass beads set in it. What could they be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really hard, but not so heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's some kind of art piece?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you'd need an art critic to confirm that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that creates a whole other problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would something like this be sent to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is bumpy, yet it feels pretty nice. It's smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like a nice, smooth seashell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. This is leaving me speechless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to get my thoughts together⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
“You should see two items in front of you. One is a mirror, and the other is a device with a very specific purpose.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A device?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This weird thing is a device?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be used for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“The mirror is a keepsake left by your mother, Keiko.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A keepsake from my mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That is what the mirror is for.[%p]
“The mirror is a keepsake left by your mother, Keiko. The strong connection between you and your mother ties you to that place.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is he trying to say? I just don't understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The connection with my mother ties me to “that place”?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“And the other device⋯ The instructions are inside the second drawer from the top.”[%p]
“Alone, this device can create enough energy to reverse approximately twelve hours. The main unit is separate.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That it can turn back time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That old bastard sounds like he's lost it.[%p]
“Make sure there are ten jewels set in it⋯”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The letters are worn and hard to read.[%p]
“⋯and go to the foot of Sword Cape at ten o'clock tonight. Someone will be waiting there for you.”[%p]
“Hand the device to that person. There you shall understand everything.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ten o'clock tonight? That leaves me less than an hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, ten o'clock tonight? Isn't this a letter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did he know it'd be tonight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“Do not tell Ayumi about this. Make sure you go alone.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“I do believe I caused her trouble. I just don't have the capacity to worry about a single person's emotions right now.”[%p]
“She must not find out about it. Not yet. But at some point, I'm sure I will tell her about it.”[%p]
“Let that responsibility rest with me.”[%p]
“You must be very careful. If there are not ten jewels in that device, there is no point.”[%p]
“If there are not⋯”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's where the letter ends.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like he stopped writing, but rather the rest of the letter was torn away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like something else was written after all this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ten jewels?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The jewels must be those glass bead things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only four set in it though. What is he talking about, ten jewels?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will happen if there aren't ten in it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Always so selfish. That guy never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
“Let's assume something here.”[%p]
“What if the path from the past to the present were not just a one-way street?”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How ridiculous. There's no way that could be true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is he talking about? Did he finally lose it?[%p]
“I'm sure right now you're thinking this is completely ridiculous. Then maybe you can prove that the path from the past to the future is a one-way street?”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“What exactly is history? The record of changes in mankind?”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
“No, that is nothing more than a record of certain things happening at certain times. That is not history.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So then, what's the history he always talked about?[%p]
“The flow of time is not an irreversible phenomenon. You must understand that it is a reversible concept.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flow of time can be reversed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means history can repeat itself?[%p]
“Not quite. History is an irreversible concept. The difference here is both miniscule and enormous.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“When I found that out, I decided to go somewhere.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
“History can't be repeated, but the flow of time is reversible.”[%p]
“By the time you read this, I shall be long gone from your sights.”[%p]
“However, this will not mean I am dead.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, seriously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew he wouldn't die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't his idea of a sick joke, is it?[%p]
“This is no joke, so you don't have to answer any knock-knocks. I have not been this serious in a long time⋯hard to believe, I know.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha, he never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That old bastard is still alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ Man, why am I flipping out like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His last attempt before his death. Oh well, I guess I'll read it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see.[%p]
“If it turns out that you have as brilliant a mind as I do, then one day, you will most certainly unravel the complicated threads of history as I have.”[%p]
“And that means a new end and new beginning for all of mankind.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, that bastard never changes. Not one bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This part is like his poetic epithet. I'll skip some parts here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“But what is the true meaning of history? Have you ever considered that, Takuya?”[%p]
“I once thought history was a record of the changes that occur as the past moves to the present.”[%p]
“I thought that it was the record and shape of the changes and fluidity of human society.”[%p]
“At least, that's what I thought until now.”[%p]
“Historians like us believe our study of history is important, that the time we dedicated to it was well spent. And so we continued researching, wasting every day.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is my old man trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is several pages long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, it actually looks like some of the pages have been ripped off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like someone wrote a note and then tore it off the paper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot of stuff written here. Let's take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]“To my dear, underachieving son⋯”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To my dear, underachieving son⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me⋯ Where's the name of the person who wrote this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]“Your loving father, Koudai Arima”?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Koudai Arima⋯that bastard?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How the heck⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, calm down. It's not like he came back from the dead or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He probably sent this letter just before he died, and now it's finally arrived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, of course. That has to be it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that old bastard thinking, sending this to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mirror is a keepsake from my mother. The other thing is some kind of device used for something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man says it can reverse the flow of time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the slightest clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a letter inside. I should probably read it just in case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is some kind of horrible joke. One might say it's more disconcerting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mirror and a strange object. What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know this isn't some kind of prank, but what's the reason behind all this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why on earth would something like this be sent to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a letter inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hand-written. Who would send me something like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I look into this a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought it'd be a video from Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I look into this more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man might be alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Anyway, Sword Cape at ten o'clock tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone is supposed to be waiting for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My gut tells me it'll be my old man waiting for me. Seems like a plan he'd think up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I ever see him, the first thing I'll do is serve him some justice with my fist. Then I'll listen to what he has to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ten o'clock tonight. It's almost time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is my old man really going to show up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, he's apparently alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to tell Ayumi about this right away and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
“She must not find out about it. Not yet. But at some point, I'm sure I will tell her about it. Let that responsibility rest with me.”[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His own responsibility, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old bastard father of mine, Koudai Arima is alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I always knew that bastard wouldn't go down so easily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's so much in this letter I can't decipher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The definition of history, the concept of reversing time, and my connection with my mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is he trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I forgetting something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go out the window, I can go down right to the front of my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I feel like I'm forgetting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. I should look at how to operate this thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, there's still a little time before the clock strikes ten.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't the letter say there were some instructions on how to operate this device?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The letter said it was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I want to know more about this strange device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The letter said the instructions for it should be in the drawer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The drawer must be referring to my old man's desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, let's go to the study first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old bastard father of mine, Koudai Arima is alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I always knew that bastard wouldn't go down so easily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's so much in this letter I can't decipher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The definition of history, the concept of reversing time, and my connection with my mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is he trying to say?[%p]
