[name]Takuya[line]It's like this path goes on forever.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There were two paths ahead of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good memory.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't creep me out⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's damp here too, just like everywhere else.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe it's from the water dripping from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the humidity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be from the water dripping down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should keep moving⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whoa, don't walk backwards.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have eyes in the back of my head, too.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]When you part the hair back there, there's a face with fangs⋯ Eek.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, are you coming or not?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, I-I'm coming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
