[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko, but what is she wearing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were hanging around Ryuuzouji's mansion last night, too.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I said I was playing catch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So are you doing batting practice now?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, I really never get tired of talking to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me ask you one thing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The words you said to me inside the locker.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did I say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You did. Mitsuki is–[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry, I have some urgent business.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What urgent business did she have? Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that woman named Kaori left at some point, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is following them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I have to go, too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't know. Can you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I uh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now that you mention it, you're right. It definitely looks like the headmaster. What a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, don't give me that look. You were cute inside that locker.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp* That has nothing to do with this.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was just being honest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you at least tell me why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sure. So every night–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop! I want the real reason. And why are you dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't you know? A wise man hides the leaf in the forest, and the rock in the riverbanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to say you're blending in dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is something funny?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, you really stand out.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh. I guess there's room for improvement.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Ryuuzouji over there?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm sure the headmaster has his own reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So? Are you saying it's a total coincidence that you're here at the same time as Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were just looking over there.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was staring into space. He happened to be where I was looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish she would take this seriously⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here, dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is it weird⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, but I heard this kind of outfit is pretty popular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then what is the problem?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is I don't know why you're here, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, well, it's a long story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like you're out on the town.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, actually⋯when night comes, I want a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, that's a good enough reason. So every night I walk the streets hunting for men. Satisfied?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Normally I'd just believe you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You suspect me for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so elusive.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Umm, who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I never would've thought⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is there something on my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, uh⋯ You look way different.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My hair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]People change a lot depending on whether or not their eyes are hidden by their hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not what I mean⋯well, kinda, I guess.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her she looks pretty, it'll go straight to her head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know Ms. Eriko was this pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is beating faster⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair always covered her face⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's smiling at me, but she looks insincere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've seen this face before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But, Ms. Eriko's cigarette⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes I wonder if she's always puffing the same cigarette.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry to bother you with my smoking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I don't care.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Still don't care?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko, I knew it.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, I can't believe this is how you knew it was me. That was a pretty big blind spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I think of Ms. Eriko, I think of cigarettes. It's like a conditioned reflex now.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm. I guess that's a subject for later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A subject?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A nice body with a cigarette in hand⋯)
[name]Takuya[line](A cigarette?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯ Is that you?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]M-My name isn't Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I said I'm not Eriko⋯*mumble mumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you mumbling about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wild night life of the school physician⋯ That would make quite a headline.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, here's the thing, I guess that's okay, yeah. How's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm saying this is just between us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're ordering me to silence?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mmhmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're being weird.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You were pretty cute today, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Inside the locker.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So how about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she has something on me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think that's someone's trademark⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wh-What do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? I've seen that cigarette before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bangs aren't in the way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks totally different.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always keep it down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look totally different just by putting your bangs up a little.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That was my intention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her intention?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That flowing hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair reminds me of someone⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, Ms. Eriko will make fun of me again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Alas, it's the sad nature of men to still be interested⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're always the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I uh, I was just thinking those clothes are a nice color.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Thank you, hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. She sees right through me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen that size and shape before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how many inches⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a secret.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey⋯ You're too obvious with your face so close to my chest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I am short-sighted.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, it's your fault for dressing like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like you're telling me to look. Geez, do you enjoy stimulating the uncontrollable libido of men?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't remember telling you not to look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? So it's okay if I look?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]On second thought, it's not okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I'm so close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk about a dangerous situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I dare say, I love a dangerous situation.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't resist that rack⋯ Stop it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe this caf⑮. The cup is stuck to the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I can't see that part of you, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrrn⋯ Ugghh⋯ Agghh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, this cup is in my way. Hrrn, grr, ahh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! I can't get it off.[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Yeah, it's stuck there with glue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's ridiculous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out of my way, nuisance![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waitress, take this cup away![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*burp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmmm⋯ This is a little rough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing should be⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Gah![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's my coffee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waitress, take this cup away![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My coffee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*burp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What am I gonna do with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No good. If I stare here, maybe the coffee will⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But my instincts tell me⋯*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's with the wide-eyed stare?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just wondering when the coffee's gonna get here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Seriously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe if I look here, they'll bring the coffee.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Um⋯ I should stop staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, this time⋯)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]I brought your refill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What is wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm angry because she's getting in the way of my manly needs.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, dang it. Guess I'll keep on trying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, that shadow tickles a man's curiosity⋯)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]I brought your refill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeey![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A-Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grr⋯ Gimme a break!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hrm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That dangerous shadow tickles a man's curiosity.)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you yelling about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kinda happy⋯but this isn't the time to be looking there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crossing her legs under a glass table⋯that makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crossing her legs under a glass table⋯that makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The question is what's Ms. Eriko doing here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her dress and behavior are so nice⋯and young.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But where⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sugar and salt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put a bunch of sugar in my mouth, and then slowly add salt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What'll happen then?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you like one?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can't do anything with the whole bottle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's sugar and salt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course, I don't need them now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are a bunch of butts in the ashtray.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Judging by the cigarette butts, you've been here for a few hours.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I smoke three at a time, so you can't make that assumption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you⋯put three in your mouth at once?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An ashtray.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman with a nice body and an ashtray. That reminds me of something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'd like to give some money to whoever invented this table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They really understood a man's mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you pressing your face against the table?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I thought it looked a little dirty.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it okay for it to be so see-through?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course it is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's one of those foliage plants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Photosynthesis has given it a good color. Oh wait⋯it's made of plastic.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shrubs. I can see Ryuuzouji and Kaori on the other side.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko was watching them⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](On the other side of the shrubs is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like Ms. Eriko was watching them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shrubs. They're foliage plants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji and Kaori are on the other side.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those earrings are pretty gaudy, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Some bling, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I remember seeing this personality somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is really standing out in this caf⑮.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez, she looks so gaudy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're standing out in this caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's weird. I thought this outfit was the least noticeable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who told you that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You said skin-tight dresses and miniskirts were what all Japanese women should wear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell if she's serious or not⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm inside the Evening Caf⑮.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
