[name]Takuya[line]It's Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This park is popular for nighttime dates.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is raging with pheromones at night, but it's so calm during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back. Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one here, even though the park is usually full of couples at night.[%p]
