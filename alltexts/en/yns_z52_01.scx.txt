[name]Takuya[line]This hill has a nice view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes isn't anywhere in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried about Celes, but let's summarize what happened until now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just thinking about it won't solve anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's keep looking for Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's look for Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a spectacular view⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I have to find Celes now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is great from here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just want to roll around on the grass⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A seemingly endless field⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can even see a desert extending far beyond⋯ I think it's called the Rafaelo Desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place definitely did not exist in the world I come from⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe a million years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A million years⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a silly idea. That can't be possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Silly, huh? Hahaha, that's the perfect way to explain my current situation here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really wish it was a dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apparently, the sight that I am seeing here is reality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And on top of that, I'm carrying a sharp sword, looking for a priestess who's lost her voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Yeah, laughing is all I can do now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Laughing is all I can do⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees grow thick⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wide forest continues on the left side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are several forests all around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Rafaelo Desert⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that desert was called the Rafaelo⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You go through the desert and eventually end up at the Imperial Capital⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's a large city, as they call it the Imperial Capital⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Celes go⋯across the desert⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. It takes more than a week to reach the Imperial Capital on foot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way she could walk through the desert for a week⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see Illia's house all the way back there, to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can catch a glimpse of a house to the right⋯ It's Illia's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯ Walked all the way from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No wonder I am tired⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, this is not the time to be thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go look for Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where I am⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela Grante⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia called this world Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can tell by the looks of it, it's definitely not Sakaimachi. Even a kid could see that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the point is, where exactly is this place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it a foreign country?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe there really is a place like this, somewhere on Earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Clouds drifting in the sky⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And strong sun burns my skin⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, that sun⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's been in the same position and hasn't moved.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even the midnight sun seen at the North Pole would still move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way that could be possible. I'm just tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. My body and mind are both exhausted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must be somewhere on planet Earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is where, exactly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia called this frontier the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Frontier⋯ Border⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it! I've been wanting a moment to think for a while now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things were all happening so fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was enveloped by light under Triangle Mountain, and then I passed out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would that cause me to come here, though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did someone bring me here? An artificial transfer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or was I brought here by some force, far beyond the scope of human understanding?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia is sleeping at the house right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seemed frail and weak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia is a protector of the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's suffering from an illness now, and it's not just your average cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would happen to me if she ended up dying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once I find Celes, I'll have to take care of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With a name like Illia, she's likely to be a foreigner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A foreigner⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is ridiculous. If she's a foreigner, then what language was she speaking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]English, French, or maybe Portuguese?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not trying to brag, but I had no problem communicating with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was never good at foreign languages, though. That means there's no logical reason for me to understand her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, we were talking like I was fluent in her language.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. That woman Celes was able to understand my thoughts, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's how we communicated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could all of this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could I communicate with Illia? Was she speaking Japanese?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She did say she was a knight serving the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A knight that guards the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And protects Dela Grante from invaders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She made it sound like some ferocious beasts invade this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told me she was prepared to fight unimaginable monsters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really doubt Illia would lie to me. So, that means she was telling the truth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A knight serving the God-Monarch, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's probably why she had this crazy sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place seems to be called the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She talked of this place like it separated countries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's usually what a border is, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's how Illia made it sound, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing that gets me is that she told me I was the first human to ever cross the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me. The first human. The first human to come to this country from the outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know how I got here in the first place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Border⋯ Something about that word is really getting to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's usually what a border is, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this place is the Border, then there must be something next to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said I crossed over the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That must mean I crossed international boundaries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I came from the country next to Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember seeing a giant cliff beyond the woods.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Another country must lie just beyond it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯ Oh yeah, I need to look for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is not the time to be lost in idle thought. I have to look for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say that once every few hundred years, God will descend upon the land.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The priestess will let God take over her physical body in order to cleanse the world through the sacred ritual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God resides in her in order to cleanse the world, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! That myth exists all over the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Celes really the priestess?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯
[name]Takuya[line]That's the woman I'm desperately searching for right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A woman that doesn't speak, but only uses body language to communicate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't speak because she's a priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She lost her own words in order to receive God's message.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A priestess is given various mystical abilities⋯ However, the holy power is awarded only in exchange for their own body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the story, I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to Illia's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess so. Standing around and thinking won't do me much good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I trying to go back to Illia's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want a moment to think right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. I came all the way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't I take a look around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. How about a little walk through the woods?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess so. Standing around and thinking won't do me much good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about a little walk through the woods?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should search around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't find Celes anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is so good⋯ I can see so far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yet, I still can't seem to find her. She didn't come this way, did she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
