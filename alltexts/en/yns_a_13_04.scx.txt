[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dead end⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing here⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((The mark of the king has been presented⋯))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((The door shall now open!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a important-looking pedestal in front of me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an oddly oppressive feeling to it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What in the world could this room be for⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything from the walls to the ceiling is completely paved with stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I wonder where the air is coming from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not having any difficulty breathing at all⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing is built pretty damn sturdily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck is this place⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are rocks on the ground⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't anything of note on the floor⋯[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]⋯It doesn't seem like it's supposed to slide sideways, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
*bmbm⋯bmbmbmbm⋯*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ No good. I can't even make it budge by pushing it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe instead of pushing it, I can pull⋯oh, there's nothing for me to hold on to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see a dividing line here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This wall is different from the rest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I need to come back with 10 jewels⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A map, huh? I guess I'll use the map and items for now and find those jewels⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I shouldn't go around pressing buttons recklessly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯is there anything else I can do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small button here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?[%p]
Press the button?
Press it
Don't press it
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I need to bring 10 jewels⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A map, huh? I guess I'll use the map and items for now and find those jewels⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I shouldn't go around pressing buttons recklessly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the entrance I just came from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I'm going back, then⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Looks like now isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
