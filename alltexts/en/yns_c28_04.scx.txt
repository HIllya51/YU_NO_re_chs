[name]Takuya[line](She's definitely that Kaori woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's the popular anchor on News Presence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing here⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And with Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now that you're here, I should ask about your work progress.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I received a copy of the document. However, the most important page was missing.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I know. We're currently working our butts off trying to find it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's taking quite a lot of time, isn't? You guys are sloppy.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Her guard is too tight, but we're really close.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]We've got one plan in the works that should really drive her into a corner.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Really⋯ What kind of plan?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's on a need to know basis.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm sure it is, but I'm so curious.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, okay. What would happen if those secret document disappeared?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There'd be chaos up and down.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]And what does chaos point to?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see. She's already been relieved of her executive duties. Now she'll be a prime suspect.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, exactly. We have the document stored in a safe place.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]A safe place.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Isn't my story cool?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((It's only something a sleazebag would think up.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What? Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No. Nothing at all.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I never intended to do things this way, you know. Well, dealing with a widow shouldn't be that hard.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you're so reliable. By the way, I should probably tell you this.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]She still knows something.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Something? Like what?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Who knows. You do know how she got to where she is in Geo Technics though, don't you?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yeah. I think she was taking over her husband's research or something.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There are too many mysteries surrounding the Hypersense Stone. She needs a certain 「something」 to elucidate it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now that you mention it, that is kind of strange. The research has been uncovered, but no one knows the logic behind it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]She may have gained some knowledge from her late husband while he was alive.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I would consider paying top dollar for some information like that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I see. I'll think about it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* I was hoping not to get her involved if I could help it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're more lenient than I thought.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No. Reducing people involved to reduce risk is an inviolable principle in the line of work.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're talking like a pro.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I am a pro.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The world would be very upset if they found that out. The famous newscaster is actually–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]My job here is done, so I'll be going now.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]All right⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Time will be up tomorrow morning. I won't be accepting anything after that, so keep that in mind.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'll get the document tonight some way or another. Actually, I'm already in the process of doing that. All that's left is that one page.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh really.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'll get it from her by the end of the night. Sounds good to you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sounds promising⋯ See you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck were they talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A copy of the document⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A missing page⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the Hypersense Stone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And who was that 「her」 they were talking about so much?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be who I think it is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Toyotomi say something about a promise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, when I get a bad feeling about something, I'm usually right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should head back to the Heights for now.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, you're not really in a position to say anything.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I know you've double-booked the job.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]One is the company I'm going to, the other is on a personal level. Yes, I think it was the headmaster of the school by the coastline.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's nothing more than an accusation. Both of those have different objectives.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]One is looking for the preservation formula of the stone, the other is looking for the stone itself.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You do know that I can't help with the rock itself at all, right?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's not like I'm counting on you for that.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll take care of it myself, so don't worry too much.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, you can't handle that ore like a normal–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I know that. It's a rare metal that will degrade and have its constitution changed just from contact with air. Particularly weak in water.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. I'm sure the clients wouldn't be happy if they knew that, would they?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is that supposed to be a threat?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't make me out to be some kind of black mailer. I'm just checking.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, you never let your guard down, do you? This kind of information is vital to hold an advantage.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm, I guess we're both playing against the rules. You seem to be taking some drastic measures as well.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I have no idea what that means.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]How about using gangsters?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now you're sounding like that dumb son of hers. Got any proof?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No⋯ Even if I did, I wouldn't use it against you. As long as you get the job done, that is.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's for your own good, too. Just remember that I have the higher priority here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yeah, that's fine. I'm not trying to entrap you, you know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Let me ask you this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Go ahead.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If I were to get you the stone, how much extra would you give me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you think you can get it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm in charge of the construction site. It's only a matter of possibility. However, I can't work for free.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll pay the same price I'm already offering.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh? That means you're getting paid even more than that. It wouldn't be worth it to you otherwise.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I only answered your question.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. Fine. If I get the chance, I'll bring it to you. In exchange for the payment, of course.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]There's something I wanted to check about the promise we made.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The promise we made?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Will the other company really take me in?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, about that⋯ I think we could've cleared things up with a phone call, couldn't we?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Considering the details of the situation, I didn't feel good unless we met to discuss it in person.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]So how about it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]My answer is yes. But only if you get it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]About that. I was wondering if I could get an extension.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you serious?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No extensions. Or else, say goodbye to that promise we made.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, that was the deal, right? You need to think about how I'm handing it over to the client.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her mid-length hair is curled a bit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to look, but I have other things I need to focus on right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What incredible breasts⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking at that right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to focus on their conversation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The size and shape of them are both perfect.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her white skin stands out even more in the night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It might be warm, but showing that much skin⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm actually kinda happy about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's really not the time to be looking at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to them⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, that should do it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh man⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You think it's a good idea to be looking there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking there now!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a pretty short skirt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm glad it is though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She almost looks like a model.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks so confident when she sits with her legs crossed like that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her legs are so long and slender.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can understand why she's so popular as a newscaster.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's holding a pair of sunglasses.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe because it's too dark for her to wear them?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thinking about it, she is a famous newscaster.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she's trying to hide her true identity with those sunglasses?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sunglasses at night?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said she's using them to show Toyotomi that she's being careful or something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Being careful, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Would it be bad if other people saw her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's having a secret meeting with Toyotomi in the park at night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something about this bothers me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said her name was Kaori Asakura.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's a popular anchor on News Presence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to focus and listen to them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi is standing on the far side.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What would he have to talk about with this lady, Kaori?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's much quieter than usual tonight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The park is so dark.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are always a bunch of couples here at Meiunji Park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But for whatever reason, tonight there's no one around.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to focus on their conversation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something about this makes me curious⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not the time for that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to listen to their conversation.)[%p]
