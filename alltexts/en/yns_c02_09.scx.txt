[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You know, it hurts when you hug me that hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You smell good too, Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to kiss you more.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]N-No. I have to go work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. You can't leave me like this.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But⋯mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, really. I have to go. I'll be late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about work.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Uh⋯ Maybe just one quick kiss⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯ I like you.[%p]

[name]Ayumi[line]I love you with all of my heart and soul.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to let go of her any more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's mine alone.)[%p]
Go to Ayumi's END
Continue on the regular route
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]*clutch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It does. I'll go easy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I haven't done this for a long time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I feel like I'm alive again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, it does feel really nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I usually take it easy, but I haven't done this for a long time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this okay?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's so⋯to the point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No it's not.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Try it one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Longer this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do without you today?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's time for you to let me go to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Are you really going?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you sad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have a lot of work to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One day won't hurt.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't afford to lose any more credibility than I already have.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, didn't they make mistakes too? They're taking advantage of you, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, yeah⋯ I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But you want me to be with you, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's unrelated.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I see. Sorry, but I have to go right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thought makes me very sad.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling the truth.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your attitude says otherwise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My attitude?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Look at you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You look so serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do? I just worked too hard last night, and now I'm tired. That's all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Is it my fault?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Why would it be your fault?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, I'm older than you⋯ Maybe you've changed your mind about me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! No, it's not that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now what do I say?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If it's not that, what is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, for example⋯ What if I'm not who you think I am? What then?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So, you regret being with me after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Never.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know I'm older than you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I just said it's not that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯ How do I tell her?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You don't have to force anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I say? This is too important. I'm scared I'll say the wrong thing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't regret being with you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I swear. I'm not lying to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why does she keep asking?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I⋯ I trust you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your eyes are still red.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I cried too much last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She was lying against me crying for a while.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She even fell asleep like that.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry about earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You know, about pinching your nose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯ Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Earlier, I was crying so much I could barely see you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I was worried you might drift off somewhere in your sleep and never come back to me⋯ So I pinched your nose to wake you up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! Where would I go?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know, I just⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, that explains why I couldn't breathe when I woke up.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ Yes. I pinched your nose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You looked way too peaceful while you were sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Just like⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say I look like that bastard. I take pride in not resembling him in the slightest.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, that's what he says too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? He actually said he's glad I don't look like him?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mhmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's okay. He said stuff like that, but I know he was thinking about you all the time. He⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man was thinking about me?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That old bastard?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She can't possibly be talking about the same guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I remind her of that old man?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must be thinking of someone else.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not my old man⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this even the same Ayumi sitting in front of me?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's not really anything to suggest that I know her at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not just this morning.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A lot happened last night.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't be naughty![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about last night?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Last night was last night. This morning is this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like Ayumi's back to normal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But the way I feel with her next to me hasn't changed.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come closer.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I want to feel your warmth, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe! Try to be more gentle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, I hope I'm not blushing.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mm⋯ You can't do things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't help my physical response when I see her body.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such beautiful, pale skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What this fantastic woman and I did last night⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with such a kind expression.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I woke with Ayumi lying right next to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And she was staring right at me.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't need to braid my hair anymore.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's just a habit now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The moment I let my hair down, I feel like a woman again.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's burying her face in the pillow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd love to be that pillow right now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I like burying my face in pillows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But I like you even more, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What? What about the pillow?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks really fluffy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, sorry, I was talking to myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let's share. Here, bring your face closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like this?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You've got to keep warm, so you don't catch a cold.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a sheet covering Ayumi and I.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come closer. Let's get in together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can feel something touching me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I can't help it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, she's blushing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's so cute.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime already.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I slept so well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's hand is so⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just so slim and attractive.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Will you hold my hand?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It makes me feel safe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't do that now.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're fidgeting so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
