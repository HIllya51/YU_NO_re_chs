[name]Takuya[line]It's an underground passage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are passageways to the front and to the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where is it coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Straight, or left?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel a very slight breeze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there water dripping somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only light. I should use it to proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not even that huge earthquake could cause this place to collapseâ‹¯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, you can never be too careful. So that's just what I'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Straight it is, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Left, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This breeze has me curious though.[%p]
