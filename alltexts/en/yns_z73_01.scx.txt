[name]Takuya[line]It's the garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's find that altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an altar at the end of the hallway. Is that it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They have nice taste. I bet it's really nice in the morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All this work for the God-Monarch done by a terrifying government at the expense of the people. How sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, I've gotten pretty cynical.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is the garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark, so I can't really see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like a pretty gorgeous place. They have good taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's lots of light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's probably here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's light, there are people. I'll have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to be very careful. This is enemy territory after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see light in that window off in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means there's at least one person here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's beyond the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Ryuuzouji say something about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Deep in the garden, down the corridor⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think that's what he said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Past the corridor, beyond the garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a corridor on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it circles the garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of pillars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a veranda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go down here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's a corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see a path in front of me. Is that it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's clear water bubbling up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need a drink right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's well cared for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means the God-Monarch still has a lot of influence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things like this fall into disrepair the moment a leader's influence begins to wane.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a beautiful fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The water is clear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where they're pulling this water up from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure where to find the altar⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look into this more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said there's an altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't found Yu-No yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I have to go back into that hole?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm supposed to be here to save Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this is right under the God-Monarch's nose. I have to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go down the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to find the altar first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No should be at the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Searching here is useless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't find Yu-No if I just stand around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The altar. I need to find the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see an altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I can see is a fountain, a flower bed, and a long corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sign of an altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just where is this altar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The altar⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An altar is a platform to make sacrifices to gods or spirits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sacrifices⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't let Yu-No make any damn sacrifice.[%p]
