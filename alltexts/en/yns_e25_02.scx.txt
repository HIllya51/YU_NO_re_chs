[name]Kanna[line]What was it you wanted to talk about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I say that?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I thought so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm not feeling very well, so would you mind if I went home now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not good. Let me take you home.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I'll be fine by myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where do you live?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]On the other side of the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means you pass by the park. The park's dark at night, and sometimes drunkards and gangsters sleep there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plus, you said you're not feeling well. What if you fainted on your way home?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see⋯ All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll pay. I asked you out, after all.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. I'll pay for my share.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, you really know how to handle yourself.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's less trouble that way. This has been my way of life for a long time now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes the things Kanna says make her seem a lot older than she looks⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This is far enough, really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Drunk[line]Hey, you! Watch out! Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never wanna see your face again.[%p]
[name]Drunk[line]Eeek! You have a bodyguard?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn drunks. There have been more and more coming out at this time lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He really bumped into you. Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm okay. Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm certain the Heights was just around the corner on the left.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way. Do you mind if I ask you a question?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You've been asking me questions this whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, have I?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I have, then that's your fault.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For being so alluring, mysterious, and charming.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You sometimes look so serious when you joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Aw, she dodged the compliment⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What was it you wanted to ask?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. It's not something serious, just so you know.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You seem to go to Triangle Mountain pretty often.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's the common name. I'm talking about Sword Cape. That big mountain on the coastline.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I go there sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night, when was it⋯about 10pm? Were you there then?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]At 10pm last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. I think I was sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why do you ask?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I thought I saw someone that looked just like you there. I was just a little curious about it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see. I was sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just wanted to make sure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing in particular⋯ I don't get to talk to you in class very often.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you made any friends yet?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you have a boyfriend?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]By boyfriend, do you mean a lover?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess so, yeah.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I don't. Not one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not one?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Not one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmph. That rumor Yuuki told me was total bullshit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna just said she didn't have a single boyfriend.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The alien⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, that was some poetic talk, if you will. Now for the real topic.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please, proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, that's what I'm talking about.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When we talk, you seem a little stiff. I think it's the interjections you use.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like when we're just talking casually, you say 「please, proceed」 like some kind of interview.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Then what shall I say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Maybe something like 「Hey Cap'n! You're in a good mood, eh?」 might be appropriate.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No good?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯ I've never met a man like you before, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's never met a guy like me before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That must mean she knows a lot of guys.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Kanna is⋯ Wait.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck am I even thinking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really wanted to talk to you about this.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, do you believe in extraterrestrials?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm talking about aliens.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, they exist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you sound so sure.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm an alien.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're an alien too, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The Earth is one body in outer space, and the people that live there are residents of the universe, so you could say we're all aliens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know something, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a real jokester, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Not as much as you, I'm afraid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's incredible that she can say it with such a straight face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her eyes seem a little cold, but maybe it's just me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But man, she never smiles.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's always got a blank expression on her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna's hair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She wears it straight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so silky, I can almost hear it shimmering.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her uniform ribbon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I took it off⋯she'd probably get annoyed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The ribbon on her uniform⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everyone that goes to Sakaimachi Academy has one.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This looks like the barley tea my sister made⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't have a sister though.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This is the barley tea your sister made, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be that Kanna is actually really funny?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You were just staring at this glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I was just experimenting with my superpowers. Trying to make it move, you know?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You really are funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Here you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This can't be![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would it be Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, no⋯ It's so shiny and nice. The table, I mean.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it were Mio, she would have called me out on it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I move my head side to side, there might be a better chance⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it too obvious?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Agh, so close!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll casually glance.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't look so blatantly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such skinny legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa there, I shouldn't stare so much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is sitting right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've never talked to her up close before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't need any sugar right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How about talking to Kanna instead?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]How many sugar cubes would you like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Three, like my age.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're funny, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She really didn't seem interested at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a glass table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish I could have a talk with whoever designed this table and put its leg right smack dab in the middle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, thanks to that, it's completely see-through.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]See-through? What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uhh⋯ That's what you call beer made by the sea. 「Sea brew.」[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That's very interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She makes it sound like it's the most boring thing she's ever heard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a very clear table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost completely clear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Plastic foliage plants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants in the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is supposed to be an ornamental foliage plant. The sheen of the plastic on it is almost sad.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mankind virtually experiences peace and tranquility in the imitation of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh, um, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet Kanna is an environmental protection activist.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're inside the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't too many people in here, but not too few, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As its name says, it's only open in the evening.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Your house is so nice and quiet, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Hey Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you actually think this is my house?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, that's what you said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, do you know what a joke is?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes, I do. It's something you say when you're messing around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah, exactly.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is there something wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna might actually be really slow.)[%p]
