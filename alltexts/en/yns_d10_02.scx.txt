[name]Takuya[line](Yuuki is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll try talking a little more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's your trademark, huh, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always have it on.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh all right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems sorta off.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I have to find Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to figure this out fast, too.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I want to cheer her up. Especially because she's in such a predicament.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll be going now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]N-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So Mio's in a predicament, huh.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Do you think Miss Mio really said it like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, this is bad.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The students all look down on her now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? Is it because of that poster?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That might be the cause, but there was a student that died from the lightning strike.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My condolences. But how is that Mio's fault?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]This is how it is: the lightning strikes were the company's responsibility, the company is connected to the mayor, and the mayor is Miss Mio's father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, they put that all together and blame Mio? Hahaha, that's some pretty crazy reasoning. It defies logic.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You can say that, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's true, right? I mean, lighting is a natural disaster. Even if the company has some responsibility, how is that related to the mayor's corruption?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Corruption should be stopped, of course. But why does all this come down on Mio? It's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]As ridiculous as we think it is, there are many more students who think like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Just who would do a thing like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The first floor bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯ That.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I feel so sorry for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you're right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I wonder who did it. All those unfounded rumors⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Unfounded rumors, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's all exactly as Mio said it to me last night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But even so, who would do that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Glaring at Yuuki won't help anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to him.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems sort of different than usual.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't think looking at my hands will help anything.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm⋯ Is something wrong with my hands?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I knew it, something's strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called a hoodie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A jacket with a hood on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the only jacket you have, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Didn't I tell you before? I have many of them in the same color and style. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he so hard to talk to?)[%p]
