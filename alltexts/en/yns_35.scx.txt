[name]Ayumi[line]I had some time before the briefing this afternoon, so I was cleaning the room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I was so focused on cleaning that I didn't notice you come home, Takuya.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]What exactly happened here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is it like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything that even looked like a book or a piece of paper was taken.[%p]
