[name]Mitsuki[line]The entrance is still blocked with boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These blasted blocking boulders are driving me bonkers.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯ I don't know how you can be telling jokes right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, my bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-The entrance⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I-It's blocked. No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. You've gotta be kidding⋯[%p]
Guuhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrnn⋯ Arrggh⋯ Come on![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no good. It won't budge.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This might be what happened to Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe. Maybe she just wanted to look inside⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And she ended up trapped, like us⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why her bag was left outside. She didn't have time to go back and get it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is Mio all right⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the question. Well, maybe she used her ancient history fanatic power to get out somehow.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Fanatic power?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her power as a fanatic.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, that was dumb.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You look⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You look pretty calm, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup, this is blocked by boulders. Bonkers![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Boulders rhymes with bonkers, sort of⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't believe it. You're still joking around in this situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I shouldn't have.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm half disgusted and half amazed. How can you be so calm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. Running around and screaming won't do anything about these boulders.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I am a man.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Look at my hand. Can you see it shaking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyone would be in this situation.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm trying to keep my cool, but I'm so nervous inside⋯ I'm so afraid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If you weren't here, I'd probably be running around and screaming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are we going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what we should do⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish I could ask someone for help⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Aren't we just going back and forth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entrance is right in front of us. We can get outside through there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But when I want to go back, I should use 「Move」 on the edge of the screen.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know what you are talking about. You're going outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
