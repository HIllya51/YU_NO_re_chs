[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's letter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll read the whole thing again.[%p]
「To my dear, underachieving son⋯」[%p]
「If it turns out that you have as brilliant a mind as I do, then one day, you will most certainly unravel the complicated threads of history as I have.」[%p]
「And that means a new end and new beginning for all of mankind.」[%p]
「But what is the true meaning of history? Have you ever considered that, Takuya?」[%p]
「I once thought history was a record of the changes that occur as the past moves to the present.」[%p]
「I thought that it was the record and shape of the changes and fluidity of human society.」[%p]
「At least, that's what I thought until now.」[%p]
「Historians like us believe our study of history is important, that the time we dedicated to it was well spent. And so we continued researching, wasting every day.」[%p]
「But let's make a different assumption. What if the path from the past to the present wasn't just a one-way road?」[%p]
「Then what is history? The record of mankind's changes? No, it's nothing more than a record of phenomena that happened at specific times. That's not history.」[%p]
「The flow of time is not an irreversible phenomenon. You must understand that it is a reversible concept.」[%p]
「So does that mean it is possible to repeat history?」[%p]
「Not quite. History is an irreversible concept. The difference here is both miniscule and enormous.」[%p]
「When I made that discovery, I decided to go to a certain place.」[%p]
「History can't be repeated, but the flow of time is reversible.」[%p]
「By the time you read this, I'll be long gone. However, this doesn't mean I am dead.」[%p]
「You should see two items in front of you. One is a mirror, and the other is a device with a very specific purpose.」[%p]
「The mirror is a keepsake left by your mother, Keiko. The strong connection between you and your mother ties you to that place.」[%p]
「The other is a device. The details of how it works can be found in the second drawer from the top.」[%p]
「Alone, this device can create enough energy to reverse approximately twelve hours. The main unit is separate.」[%p]
「Make sure there are ten jewels set in it⋯」[%p]
「⋯and go to the foot of Sword Cape at ten o'clock tonight. Someone will be waiting there for you.」[%p]
「Hand the device to that person. There you shall understand everything.」[%p]
「Do not tell Ayumi about this. Make sure you go alone.」[%p]
「She must not find out about it. Not yet. But at some point, I'm sure I will tell her about it.」[%p]
「Let that responsibility rest with me.」[%p]
「You must be very careful. If there are not ten jewels in that device, there is no point.」[%p]
「If there are not⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flow of time is reversible. You can go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I first read this, I just thought that bastard was crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use :selitem: for :selatr:⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off, what am I supposed to do with :selitem: on :selatr:?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's give it some more thought⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I don't think those go together very well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't use :selitem: there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't supposed to be used for :selatr:, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't something I can use now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening⋯ Well, that's not surprising.[%p]
