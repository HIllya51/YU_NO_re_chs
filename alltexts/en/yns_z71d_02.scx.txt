[name]Takuya[line]Where the hell did Ryuuzouji go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Neither Ayumi nor Ryuuzouji are here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the wind coming from the prison.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there water dripping somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only light. I should use it to proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There better not be another earthquake right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll head over to the town.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like I can proceed left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try that way.[%p]
