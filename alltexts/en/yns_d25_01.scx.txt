[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An antique-style light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty old-looking light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it really sets the atmosphere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll want to go to the bathroom if I keep looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bathroom's in the back on the left side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like going to the bathroom right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could increase entropy here, but the waitress would yell at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, it's incredibly unnatural for entropy to be small and ordered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meaning this caf⑮ is breaking the laws of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I'm the only one who would think this much about simple tables and chairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tables and chairs are evenly spaced around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entropy is extremely low.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, there is a tendency of things to move from order to disorder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light hanging down like some kind of plump eggplant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's the caf⑮'s style of choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These curtains are rather unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rolling screens have become more popular recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are paintings on the walls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone said that art isn't determined by the people, but by a bunch of brokers somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand that, I guess. I can't see what's so good about this painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some paintings on the walls, but I have no clue what they're depicting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an innocuous painting.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You should watch a little TV, keep an eye on the news⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I was gossiping with him now.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Didn't you see the news? What, you didn't?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]News Presence, where that one reporter went and slammed Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]So you didn't see it?[%p]
[name]Man[line]There haven't been any juicy scandals recently.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh yeah, this is my only line.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Sorry bud, but I'm unemployed right now.[%p]
[name]Man[line]What's the reason?[%p]
[name]Man[line]I heard the current mayor is involved in some shady stuff.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I don't take that news lightly. Hence why I'm boycotting.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Don't tell anybody.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh* Sitting down quietly, sipping coffee like this.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Ah, people with nothing to do sure live a sad existence.[%p]
[name]Man[line]We're in a recession now. That time when we were working 24/7 before the bubble burst seems like forever ago.[%p]
[name]Man[line]Me? I was working construction at the coastline, but I quit. I had my reasons.[%p]
[name]Man[line]A man should always silently sip coffee.[%p]
[name]Man[line]*sigh* This coffee is sweet.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I actually prefer coffee.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Caf⑮s and greenery are completely inseparable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is pretty empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fancy, yet it's not that crowded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a jukebox.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like song number 1 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 2 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 3 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 4 is playing right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 5 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 6.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 7 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 8 is playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's playing song number 9.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Song number 10 is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can play whatever song you like in the caf⑮ by pressing the button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want it to stop, hit the red EXIT button on the bottom right and things will go back to normal.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm gonna go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song really makes this place feel like a caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of when I talked to Ms. Eriko on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song has a somber mood to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song puts me on edge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me want to jump for joy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song brings back so many memories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm moving outside when I listen to this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason I want to call for my big brother when I hear this song.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The poppy rhythms in this song sound so fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song makes me feel like I need to stay up all night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This song reminds me of that one game.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, what was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listening to this song makes me realize there's some strange music in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, pressing that isn't going to do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Press the button.[%p]
