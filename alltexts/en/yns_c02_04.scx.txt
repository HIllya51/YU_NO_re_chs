[name]Takuya[line](What am I getting so nervous for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi might notice if my heart is beating this loudly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! Okay, just⋯ Just calm down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is just a little tired.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was my old man good to you?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. Very good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sometimes I feel like he's still alive somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, that's impossible though, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what if, and this is just an if, my old man were still alive?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Purely hypothetical. If he were alive, what would you do?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'd slap him in the face, first off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Then I'd spring into his arms, cry my eyes out, and forgive him with a big hug.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why does it feel like my heart is getting all wound up?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's making my heart ache.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]We have to do our best to keep going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If I'm ever too weak to stand on my own two feet, I want you to support me in place of Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will. I promise. No matter what.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you⋯ I'm going to sleep now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*zzz*⋯*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's asleep. She's like a little kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So many things happened today. It was like an unfettered storm.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet Ayumi is having the hardest time of her life.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something about what happened at the park really bothers me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The gangsters Toyotomi was talking to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those guys attacked Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They were going for the envelope she had.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard that the document was in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't have any proof. I can't tell Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, what if it's just me jumping to conclusions?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd cause a lot of trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tomorrow I'll find out for sure. If that bastard Toyotomi is doing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯whatever I think he's doing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*zzz*⋯*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's like a little kid. Cute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what am I saying? That's my stepmom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Support her like my old man did?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. Why am I getting so ticked off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that bastard is still alive, I'll teach him a lesson.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I'll bring him to Ayumi. Everything will be okay as long as she's happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what if⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would I do if that bastard is really dead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or what if I never find him?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is still young, but old enough to be on her own.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't have to stick around this house forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long is she going to stay here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, how long can I stay here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯with Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]((Hey.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I can hear you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Then you could at least look at me.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((You're still not thinking logically, are you Takuya? If you can talk, you can communicate. Look at how the phone works.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Old man, you're always saying the same stuff.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((That is the so-called truth in history.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hrmph. Truth in history⋯whatever. And?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((And what?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'm asking when you're coming home next.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((No idea.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((No idea? Is that all you can say?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((No.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What are you going to do with Ayumi?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((What do you mean?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You haven't been married that long yet.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Oh, well. That is my job, and my mission.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((It's not like I'm asking you to be a better father. But, for Ayumi's sake, at least try to perform well as a husband.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Yeah, I do that every night.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Take it easy. I'm just joking.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((It doesn't sound like a joke.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((She understands how important my work is.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Maybe⋯ But don't you think she gets a little lonely?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Oh, suddenly you're an expert at reading people.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I can tell Ayumi is trying too hard.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Right. She is a wonderful woman who always keeps a smile on her face.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah, so you should be more–))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I told her how it was going to be long before we got married. She accepted that and married me anyway.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You can't use logic to explain away how someone feels.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Hrmph. You fall in love with her yourself or something?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?! Shut up! I'm just worried about her. That's all.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I know. Don't bark at me.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Takuya⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I know it's a lot for your little pea brain to understand, but I need you to listen carefully.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Are you trying to pick a fight?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I'm studying history.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I know. So?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((History is a memory of accumulated time and experiences. It's a record of change.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((So?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((History is not a temporal memory. Most textbooks interpret history as memory of temporal change.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Isn't it? We memorize what we've done in the past, our accumulated history and⋯ What? Why are you laughing?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I'm sorry. It's not what you're saying. After all, it's what you've been taught. It's in all the latest textbooks.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Consider this: history also exists in the transition of time itself.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I don't understand what you are saying.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Okay, for example, I was eating Ayumi's homemade cake about this time yesterday.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((So what?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I was eating cake, and I was thinking, 「What if I don't eat this right now?」))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Let's say I decided to go back to that point in time yesterday.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((No way. You can't do that.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Let's just assume I can for the sake of a thought experiment.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Assume some old guy can travel back in time any time he wants?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Right.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's the point? It's not possible.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I told you, this is just a thought experiment.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((*sigh* Okay, fine. So you go back to this time yesterday. You're planning to eat cake when you get there? And?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((What if I don't eat the cake?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Then, historically, you didn't eat the cake. This time yesterday would just be a world in which you didn't eat cake.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((No.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Why not? What's the difference?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((If I didn't eat the cake, then how would my decision to travel back to the past have happened?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((It happened because you ate cake. So you decided to go back to the past to see what would happen if you hadn't eaten the cake, and then⋯ Huh.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Yes. I went back to the past because eating the cake gave me a reason to do so.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((And as a result, a world in which I decided not to eat cake is created.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Well⋯ Yeah.))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I eat the cake and go back to the past, which results in a world in which I do not eat the cake. These differences then become carved into history.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((I'm not saying that you have to understand right now. But just remember this.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((Everything in our world is dominated by causality.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Causality?))[%p]
[name]Koudai[line]((And the elucidation leads to a quest for history.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((A quest⋯for history?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What does that even mean, old man?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hey! Answer me.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's kind of difficult to sleep right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not moving around a lot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But for some reason, I feel⋯comfortable and warm.)[%p]
*squish*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels really warm.)[%p]
*squish squish*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can feel something in my hands, and it nice to squeeze⋯)[%p]
*squish*[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, that voice⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is Ayumi sleeping right next to me?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Calm down. Just calm down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff* *huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, good. I'm calm.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. We fell asleep on the sofa.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
*squish*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her breast is pushing right up against me⋯)[%p]
*groan*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no⋯ I'm going to get a nosebleed or something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want Ayumi to find out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi. Hey, Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mm⋯ I can't eat another bite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](「I can't eat」? Geez, she's talking in her sleep.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mm⋯ Forgive me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, well. I'll just carry her to her room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't leave her sleeping here like this.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*zzz*⋯*zzz*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, well. I'll carry her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is my heart beating so fast? I'm just carrying her to her room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll try not wake her. Gently⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wow! She is surprisingly light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll just carry her like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Here's Ayumi's bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll let her sleep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe, she'll get up soon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should head back to the living room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing when you were in school, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]When I was studying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, that's right. I don't know how you met my father.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He was studying and teaching history. I was majoring in design engineering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the connection?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]History is an academic discipline required for all fields. It just so happened that we met and hit it off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what kind of guy hits on his student?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, no⋯ I talked to him first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's true. At first, I just told him there were parts of his lecture I didn't understand and asked if we could discuss them over lunch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That excuse worked?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Of course. Then, for a while, we were going to dinner together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]When Koudai told me he was single, I offered to cook a meal at your house. Right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are surprisingly aggressive, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]When I was younger, they called me Audacious Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are wild, I'll give you that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]True, but I let things get out of hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you fell into the clutches of my old man after all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. Romantically, Koudai is very inexperienced.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hahaha! You don't know much about your father, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I practically had to hit him over the head before he finally noticed me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't think he was too⋯intense?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. You see, Koudai hadn't gotten over Keiko yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Keiko? You mean⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's right. Your real mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But I made him pay attention to me eventually. I feel bad for your mother though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't. She wouldn't mind⋯ I'm sure my mother is happy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you. I'm glad to hear that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm going to close my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It'll be easier for me to keep talking with my eyes closed. Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No problem.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do you remember the first time we met?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I do. I think you were still in grad school when you came to visit my house.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. You certainly had an attitude back then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is that right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The first time you saw me, you said 「Hmph」![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I was just surprised that a beautiful woman came to visit.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha, you're sweet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, how long have you been with my old man?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. You don't have to answer that if you don't want to.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No. It's fine. I want you to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well⋯ It was after I entered grad school. Maybe since I started attending Professor Ryuuzouji's seminars?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Dr. Arima⋯ Koudai⋯and Ryuuzouji were friends.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's been studying history that long?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. He had a reputation for being an unusual yet amazing scholar, but when I talked to him, I learned something else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That he has a dirty mind?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! Don't be an idiot! I knew he was a spectacular researcher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Spectacular?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]His way of thinking, his hypothesis, his approach to history⋯ Everything was unconventional and fresh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of research was he doing?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He always told me he was studying the meaning of history.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The meaning of history⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's going to hear my heart thumping out of my chest.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have a favor to ask.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? What favor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Would you⋯sleep here tonight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sleep? Here?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. The two of us⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, my heart's about to explode!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? You're wiggling around a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not⋯ It's not that. I mean, I know I'm a man, but it's not what you think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh, what am I saying?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Am I disturbing you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I mean. Not at all![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Good⋯ Let's sleep together tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Parents cuddle with their kids all the time, right? This is normal⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯cuddling is a totally normal thing to do.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just when we're sleeping, though?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha! What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't take this anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I never dreamed I'd be thinking things like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's sliding her body up close to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is just a family being close. Nothing more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You've got a broad chest⋯ Just like your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really don't want to hear that I'm just like my father.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! Parents and their children are always like that. It doesn't matter that you have a close relationship.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I think you and I are closer.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez, maybe that was too direct?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Doing this makes me feel like I'm with Koudai.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes you feel like you're with my old man?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I feel comfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry I remind you so much of him.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why would you apologize? Can't you tell that I'm happy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no. My heart is going to burst out of my chest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hope she can't hear it thumping.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a cut on your cheek?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm okay. It's just a scratch. Nothing's wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That document of yours was important.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Document?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What those thugs took.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was important stuff, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, it was important to the company, yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. It's my fault.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't worry. You're more important than some document, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe I can go to the company and explain what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you lose something that important⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It doesn't matter anyway. The most important page is missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The page I lost, remember? It happened around noon today in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you talking about that page that you lost?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*smirk* That's right. I am. Maybe it's good I lost that when I did. Without the restoration formula, those documents are worthless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What restoration formula?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Think of it like the cheese in a mousetrap.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or a beef bowl without beef?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! It's so like you to use that as an example, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what happened?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If Toyotomi hadn't helped me, I would have been in big trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi helped you?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. He chased those creeps off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, that would be greedy.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not really sure what to say.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I'm not careful, Ayumi may get into trouble.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can really depend on him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He's a good man who really supports me behind the scenes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy? Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't talk like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That bastard Toyotomi was trying to⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. Why am I getting so angry?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will happen to you if they find out the document's missing, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have to accept the consequences of my mistakes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry. If they fire you, I'll get a job.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't be stupid. Never underestimate your guardian, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm all right. You just focus on your studies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm the parent. I need to be the dependable one. I'm just worried about you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are dependable. (I know I have to be dependable too, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! You're so sweet, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm always on your side.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're very flattering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't look at my face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry. I'm not looking.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Liar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only just a little⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I like the way you are, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You don't have to talk, okay? Just pay attention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am just a little tired. That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I am fine. I'll be back to the same old Ayumi by tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't push yourself too hard. If you need anything, I want you to ask me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. We're family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi looks so tired.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't blame her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was that riot during the daytime briefing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then the gangsters at the park⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did she tell the police?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She told me she was fine earlier.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it's my responsibility. And it's my fault Ayumi lost that document.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. I'm useless.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm touching Ayumi's shoulder⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like we're a lot closer all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on Takuya, just do it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're very aggressive, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If you have to apologize, then you shouldn't have done it in the first place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, but this isn't⋯ I mean it's not that⋯ Oh, what am I even saying?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I know you care about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she saying it's okay for me to touch her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're like a parent and child. We can't do that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, it's just my hand on Ayumi's shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should give her a compliment.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's my shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is leaning up against me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop. Ayumi won't like that.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please don't look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course. No one wants to be seen crying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is what Ayumi looks like when she cries.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the first time I've seen her like this up close.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Any other time she's around me, she makes sure she's always smiling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must have cried her eyes out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair's so shiny, it's practically glowing on its own.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And it has such a beautiful scent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! My heart keeps beating so fast.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hair⋯ It's beautiful.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you. You're the only one who says things like that to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't you ever have someone to tell you that?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Haha! Yes. Your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't have asked.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if it's by accident, I shouldn't inhale and smell her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even her ear is cute and tiny.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi doesn't have pierced ears.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like her natural style.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is tied up.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has it wound into a beautiful braid.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ha! Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see Ayumi's bra.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn! My heart is beating like crazy. I'm terrible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bra⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm old enough now that I shouldn't be getting this excited over a bra.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah! Shut up![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ Nothing! I just heard, uh, a weird sound. I'm sure it's nothing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-B-Boo⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Boo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez! Did I almost say that out loud?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Boo! Wouldn't it be weird if this place was haunted?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't press up against me so much.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What wrong? You're fidgeting a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there was just something pressing on me⋯ Ah! What am I talking about?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not a good position to be in.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart keeps beating faster and faster.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If she keeps pressing up against me like that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gah!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Gah?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah gah the goose goes⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What song is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really want that to ride up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I thinking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It would be pretty great if that rode up.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? You're practically hyperventilating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi hasn't changed her clothes yet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That particular skirt rides up in the wind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's legs⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's really nice, but I shouldn't stare too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want her to press up against me anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Otherwise, I might not last.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's touching her bare feet to my legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What can I do for her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's snuggling up really close to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But this isn't supposed to mean anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no room for misinterpretation here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's sliding her body up close to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is just a family being close. Nothing more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I just staring at a cushion?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the sofa we're sitting on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't care what it is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to look at Ayumi right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No. That's not it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't use that here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, Ayumi is acting strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be using stuff.)[%p]
