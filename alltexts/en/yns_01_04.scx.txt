[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these things are piling up inside my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess shouldn't talk to Ayumi about my old man yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I tell Ayumi about my old man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I show her my old man's letter, she might brighten up a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ She's not the same Ayumi as the one in the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But aside from that point, she looks exactly like Ayumi from any angle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's also a possibility that she might be a different Ayumi tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I tell her about my old man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope, no way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if, by some small chance, my old man isn't even alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd get her hopes up and then let her down. Can I really handle that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been six months since she married my bastard of a father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Becoming a widow after just half a year? She's probably more devastated than I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to see her suffer anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know what? All of this is that bastard's fault. Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even want to think about that stupid prick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's responsible for all this⋯that stupid bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if he was trying to teach me a lesson, but dying and sending me a letter?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then giving me this device?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know if he's dead or alive now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only thing I do know is that I have this perplexing device in my hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji once said that my old man should be somewhere in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somewhere in⋯this world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the world that I'm in right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only clues I have⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯are this device and mirror.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And Ryuuzouji's words.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, Mitsuki said Ryuuzouji seemed strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji was acting strange and⋯different than usual⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be that Mitsuki was sensing something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki seemed to be afraid of Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of change is happening with Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's Ryuuzouji's secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was a substitute teacher at my school for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was a history teacher. She had an interesting approach to teaching, like using my dad's book as a textbook in class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She actually dated me for a while. In secret, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I thought she had a crush on Ryuuzouji, but I guess it was just a meaningless affair after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it never grew into true love.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was getting out of hand around that time, and for some reason we ended up wanting each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until Mio found out about us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Duh. I need to stop. What am I thinking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Clearly, the important thing is what she said today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said that Ryuuzouji is different now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Different⋯but how?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji is different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did he change?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji is my old man's best friend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or should I say, he was. You'd have to be out of your mind to point a gun at your best friend's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki says he's different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be related?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll never forget how he pointed that gun at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what about Ryuuzouji now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He acts like it never even happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are only two reasons I can think of. He's either shamelessly playing stupid, or⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯he's not the Ryuuzouji I know.
[name]Takuya[line]If he's not the Ryuuzouji from Sword Cape⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If he's not Ryuuzouji from back then⋯
[name]Takuya[line]But if that's the case, where did that Ryuuzouji go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what about Ayumi from back then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it can't be. Maybe the Ryuuzouji from that time didn't just disappear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or could it be myself that disappeared?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to find out more about Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was there any kind of hint?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need something to get started. Anything will do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji,[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His secretary Mitsuki,[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His mother that talked to her about him and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I got it. There's one more person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, in that dark hallway.
[name]Takuya[line]Right, they were having a strangely secret meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't know what they were talking about though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it! He was talking to that really hot news anchor from News Presence![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could Kaori be the woman I found in the clip of the diary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. If it's a woman, they would be referred to as 「she.」 Besides, there's no way of knowing who it's actually referring to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it has me curious. It doesn't feel normal.
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji, hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What else do I know about him? Oh, there's that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about that huge samurai mansion he and his mother live in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Samurai mansions are always cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cursed, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cursed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, I remember Ryuuzouji saying something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, try to remember, Takuya! It was something that seemed so strange at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why can't I remember? What was I talking to Ryuuzouji about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. It was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You didn't go to the shrine last night, did you?))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((I was in the house all night. I'm actually afraid of the curse, so I don't go out too much at after dark.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((The curse?))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((Oh, you don't know?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I've heard of it, but I don't know much.))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((Two people already died. Can't be too careful.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did he say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((Oh, you don't know?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I've heard of it, but I don't know much.))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]((Two people already died. Can't be too careful.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Two people?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Two people died from the curse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There should have only been one person that got eaten by that tiger or panther or whatever it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could the other person be then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who-What is it?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The bath is ready, so get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, okay, thanks. I'll take a bath in a bit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. Zero nerves, that one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I want to go check out Ryuuzouji's samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I already said I can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use an item for my imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I even saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey! What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit doing something so meaningless.[%p]
