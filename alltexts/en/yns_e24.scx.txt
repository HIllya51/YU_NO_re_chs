[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The most talked about company now. And I don't necessarily mean it in a good way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have an appointment or anything. I just kind of showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have an appointment or anything. I just kind of showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Oh, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, this woman is⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I knew it was you. You're Dr. Arima's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's a popular newscaster doing here?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, I'm glad you think so. Hearing that is the best thing to get me motivated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't play innocent. You were bad-mouthing Ayumi nonstop last night.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You have some nerve. You said all those things on the news last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is that what you thought?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Teehee, I understand what other people think. It must be because I study people's behaviors and expressions for my job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what you're thinking, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, exactly.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I knew it. It was all over your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unfortunately, I'm not one of your lowbrow fans. I don't have the energy to smile at you, Ms. Asakura.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Stop it with Ms. Asakura. Call me Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't get this woman.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oops, we'll get in trouble if we stay here too long. This is private property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It belongs to the company.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But the security is pretty sloppy. That's the bad thing about intelligent buildings. There are more blind spots than you'd think when a person isn't in charge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, uh-oh. The scary chief is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, I want to ask you about your father sometime. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The scary chief?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, it's the scary chief![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahaha. Hey, Ayumi, you look prettier than ever today.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know what you want to say. So don't say it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay, I'll keep it short.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I trust you, Takuya. But I don't want you to make me worry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I'll make sure to let you know next time I'm spending the night out.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah. I'll do my best to live up to your expectations.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why are you talking like a politician?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. Answering like a politician is pretty convenient. I guess it's not what you say, it's how you say it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I apologize, please forgive me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, all right. You're that age when you want to play around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wasn't trying to play around or anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her I spent the night at a girl's house, Ayumi just might faint.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes it's compassionate to lie. I think so anyway.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Anyway, that woman you were talking to here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori Asakura. She's a popular newscaster.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What did that woman want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she really went after you last night. I saw it on TV.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't do anything wrong, Ayumi, but she made it seem like it was all your fault.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm the one in charge. The person in charge is there to take responsibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's the company's responsibility, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Even so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't understand that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Taking responsibility is part of what they pay me for. I have to follow company policy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're against all of this–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't say anymore. Please. Okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I wonder what Kaori wanted anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't know. That reminds me, she scuttled off as soon as she saw you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe she's investigating something again. That woman looks easy-going, but she really is sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Could she be looking into last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*sigh* I really shouldn't be telling you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It seems someone broke into Geo Technics last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! Into this fortress?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Luckily the guard noticed and set off the alarm, so nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's good.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The intruder broke into the laboratory. That means company secrets could be leaked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry, I have to go now. Problems are piling up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry. I might be late again tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It should all be over in a couple of days. See you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A couple of days, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how long I can stay here.[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I think the coast is clear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be bad if I got chased by the guards again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are still lights on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi working in there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's cleaned up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet Toyotomi did his best to clean it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel a little good for some reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nobody around⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty messy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are placards and sashes all over the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's mostly stuff from the protestors.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh, I have a bad feeling.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You can't be in here⋯ Hmm, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the handsome nice-guy.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's the chief's distantly-related son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean distantly-related son?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You don't look so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I just started feeling sick.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, cheeky. Looks like you're too late. The briefing is already over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about briefs for?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Not the men's underwear. A briefing. Meaning an explanatory meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, Ayumi said something about that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the explanatory meeting for local residents.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's right. They were just holding the meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, how did it go?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, we can't answer to the irresponsible and emotional arguments of these locals.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]The chief tried her best to handle them alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alone? Ayumi stood alone against the group of protestors?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, yes. There were some terrible people throwing eggs, but no one was hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! You said they were throwing eggs?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]They were just like a group of protestors. And when the target of their protest came out, of course they were angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what were you doing?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I was cheering her on in the shadow of the trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy dumb?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't look at me like that. If you have to hate something, hate the company. It was company orders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Company orders?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]We were told to leave everything to her. There was nothing I could do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmph, whatever.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I hate emotional arguments more than anything. They're lower than monkeys.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A conscientious business would take those emotional arguments into account.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't mistake me. We are a for-profit organization, not a charity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So refusing the emotional arguments of local residents is how you make a profit?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, listen, don't forget that your stepmother is an employee of this company, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you gonna start cleaning up now?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What? I am the construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm thinking of something.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, home with you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk. You're covering something up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. I guess I'll go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they really going to have an explanatory meeting here today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that was a workout, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm this tired, I must be really out of shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess quitting kendo affected me more than I thought.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Eek.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Ahh, my papers⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I wasn't looking.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no⋯oh dear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they really going to have an explanatory meeting here today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi's company always like this?[%p]
