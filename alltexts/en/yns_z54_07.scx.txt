[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, I'm sorry. But this is for your sake. Please understand.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Sorry for being so loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you're right. I'll try not to snore anymore.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I, um, I saw you crying earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You were whispering Mom's name and crying. It made me sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, so you caught me⋯ I haven't cried since then.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah. I haven't cried either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a strong one.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Do you know why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Look here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]My chest is warm. If I close my eyes, it's like I can feel Mom breathing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes⋯breathing?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I can feel Mom talking to me. She says it's okay. She says I should follow you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is⋯inside you, Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, she's not actually in my chest. It's just a kind of⋯warmth. It's Mom's warmth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not real. It's just what I want to believe.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Believing that would ease my grief. It's my heart's way of protecting itself.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She really said that to me. She said I should follow you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't bring your mother into this⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I thought about why I haven't really cried since Mom died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]At first, I thought not feeling anything made me a bad person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not a bad person.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I know⋯but that's what I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The reason I couldn't cry⋯is because when I close my eyes, my chest feels warm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Like Mom is holding me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's true. Mom is always with me. Knowing that made me feel better, happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If I can lessen your sadness even a little⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Then I'll always follow you. Anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you have to promise me one thing![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay! Anything![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't rush into things, slow down![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Tell me, tell me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want you to worry about my safety. I only want you worrying about yourself.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unless you can promise that, I won't take you with me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have to put your own safety first. Understand?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please. When push comes to shove, I honestly don't trust myself to protect you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would help me a lot to know you can take care of yourself at times like that.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay. I'll do my best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then we need to prepare two weeks' worth of food and water.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yep! I already got everything ready![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you're certainly prepared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right. This might actually be a good thing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Every person makes their own happiness.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No will make her own happiness.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That might be for the best.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is good-bye to this place for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Four years⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Hahahah, I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm all right. I was just thinking.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to go. We'll be back before we know it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah! I'll go get our things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This won't be easy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My goal is to find their boss. I'll make their God-Monarch explain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it had better be a good explanation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯ I'll make them grovel in the dirt and apologize to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If not⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a seven-day trip to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia told me how to get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll bring enough food and water to last us two weeks. One week on the road will be no problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be back soon, Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be back before you know it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Before you know it⋯
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, Yu-No, listen up.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, listen to me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This might be dangerous.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, please. Remember what we talked about last night. I can't bring you with me, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those guys from the Imperial Capital⋯ You saw them, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a normal trip. I can't guarantee I'll make it back.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No! You have to come back![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If you die, then I will, too! I'll kill myself![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't even joke about that![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry⋯ I didn't mean to shout.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, don't ever talk about dying or killing yourself.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know how you feel, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No, you don't! You don't know at all![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You're important to me, Dad! No, you're my life. If you die, then I will, too. Your fate is my fate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your fate is my fate? Who taught you that?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Please, Dad. I promise I won't get in your way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You getting in the way isn't the problem.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll do anything. I'll rub your shoulders, clean the house all the time, and do the laundry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Please don't leave me behind![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm not leaving you behind.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I would never leave you behind. I could never do that.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's going to be a hard trip. I want to do what's best for you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If you want what's best for me, then take me with you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You said it yourself. We need to work together when it gets tough. So why do you get to decide this by yourself?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh boy. Now what do I do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen. I'll only be gone for a little bit. I'll be right back.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Crossing the desert will be a really tough journey.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, I don't know what's in the desert.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There might even be monsters.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Please. Don't leave me alone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't leave you alone. Where did Kun-Kun get to?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Kun-Kun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I sent her back to the forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you do something so selfish?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]If we leave Kun-Kun alone in the house for two weeks, she'll die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're gonna take care of her![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm going with you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you're not![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, I am![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the lizard?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I left food for her. She'll have plenty to eat for a month.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was really hoping Celes's stubbornness wouldn't rub off on her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's just like Celes in every way.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I have a favor to ask.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I didn't say anything![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I'll say it for you. You were going to say you want to go with me.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I want to go with you, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No means no.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Why not?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because you can't.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already told you last night. I have to walk across the Rafaelo desert for seven days. That's absolutely impossible for a regular person.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But, Dad, you're going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a normal person.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Neither am I![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you even know what a normal person is?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It means, uh⋯ It means a normal person. Don't you know that, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Once Yu-No decides not to listen, she really digs her heels in.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I thought I convinced her last night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Today will be the last time I see this house for a while.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The only one in this house will be Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No wants to talk to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I already know what she wants to say.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, I need to talk to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know what you want to say, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No's hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her shining, golden hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must have a lot of Celes in her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking at that now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I care about my daughter, but I can't afford to get distracted right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey! Why are you just staring at your daughter like that?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad! I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
