[name]Takuya[line]The garden⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't seen any Royal Guards recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are Yu-No and Amanda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An interdimensional transportation device⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where would something like that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't in the garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the garden.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Hey, you! What are you doing sneaking around here? Oh, a guest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]No, not anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit! Where did that bastard Ryuuzouji take Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the garden.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]The God-Monarch isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The God-Monarch⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's such a nice morning, especially in this garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to enter the dungeon through that cellar door.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I should have come through the exit I used yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be careful. This could be a trap.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But, Dad, isn't that your mom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Best to err on the side of caution.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's like what you're thinking and what you're doing are complete opposites, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, why are you with me, anyway? I told you to stay at Ms. Eriko's house.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But last night you said we'd always be together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's the problem.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]That is the problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What I say and what I think are opposites? Ha!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah. Best to err on the side of caution.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if it's just Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But this is where we agreed to meet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's late.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place isn't bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I heard it was the God-Monarch's garden, I figured it would be some stuffy, nouveau riche mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Their taste isn't all that bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I feeling so much regret being here?[%p]
