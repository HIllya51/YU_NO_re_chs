[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, not even Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Back to the small room it is.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki⋯are you okay?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Did you find something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe it's because you put that coin in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Keep going of course. Staying here won't do us any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-Wh-What? It w-went out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like a broken record. Come on, the light just went out, that's all. No need to panic.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay, b-but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're fine.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Haha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems so dimwitted all the time, but I think he's actually afraid of the dark.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it's nyctophobia⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We need to get this done as soon as possible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it's a door, doesn't that mean we can open it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's why you're the Boss Man. So, how do we open it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck is that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a door.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]A door here? That's strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would something like that be here?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Do you think I know the answer to that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not at all.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That⋯kinda hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A door, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's clearly man-made.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means someone came down here and built it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could its purpose possibly be⋯?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man, what is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My guess is it's an underground passage made with a specific purpose in mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Like, for what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't ask me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, what if this is the underground base of some dubious cult?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An underground base?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The underground base of Demon-man Gerge, leader of all evil and traumatizer of children, just like those sci-fi actions shows that used to be all the rage on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Demon-man Gerge?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I should slap some sense into you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't look so angry, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're not wrong about it being created by some kind of underground organization.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]A dubious underground organization?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if it's dubious or not, but it would be impossible to build with just a few people.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this whole thing was dug out by a group of people, it must have taken a long time.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which means what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It means⋯ If it were such a big project, there would have to be some kind of record of it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which means what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It means it would be obvious to see who did it if we checked public records, but there are no records like that in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which means what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think about it a little bit.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯ I don't really know what you're saying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there are no records like that in Sakaimachi, then this was here long before the city was founded.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So what does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't look so angry, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It means, what the heck is this thing?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So we're back to the original question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I hate it, but you're right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Then what could this all mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that's what Mio was researching. That old bastard might have been researching the same thing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Your father⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's check it out. We might find something.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯[%p]
