[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's strange. Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be standing around watching this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's not coming out of there, even if I stare at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that doesn't matter right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's so interesting about a lamp?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my room's light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, it's not really enough to light the whole room⋯ I suppose it's just decorative.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to read that right now. I should put it away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're almost all history books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old bastard gave them to me and told me to read them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'm partially responsible for actually reading them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This cushion's not very handy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've almost never used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't bother with something so meaningless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shelf full of magazines.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shelf filled with magazines. There's almost nothing else in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really keep stuff, so I don't have much to put on the shelf.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The clock gets set every day, so it's supposed to be accurate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man bought that clock in some random country.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That crappy clock loses a few minutes every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I leave through there, I'll fall onto the roof of the house next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They'll think I'm a burglar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The roof of the house next door is just below here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The window to the right leads straight to the front of my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wallpaper that looks like wood paneling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoever decorated must like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only wall with wood paneling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wallpaper that looks like wood paneling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Naturally, it's fake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it was real, it would be worth more than this house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to be by some famous artist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it Honet, or Konet, or Kinet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Got it! Monet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like sitting right now. I'm just looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the chair I prefer to sit in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a reason it has five legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you lean way back, you won't fall over. With only four legs, you'd topple right onto the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to study. If there's nothing else to do, then I guess I'll exercise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the desk I sit at to read comics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never studied at this desk. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to use that right now. It's not like I plan to order delivery or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki called. Ayumi's at the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to hurry to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to hang it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cordless extension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one in the living room, one in Ayumi's room, and one in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where the main phone is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that I won't study. It's that I can't study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just believe me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not much room on the desk. But it doesn't matter, because I'm not going to study anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are books, an MD player, pencils, that kind of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever I put in here gets lost. It's like a black hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Make sure you think before you use an item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously. Everything that goes in there disappears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. It's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could this drawer have something extra special in it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. It was right here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I put away the stuff I can't show Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯like that test I failed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see what we can find here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? It's pitch black.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a useless table lamp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lamp didn't do anything wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light stand to not ruin your eyesight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I've never used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty useless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here. Let's go down to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, to the living room![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi wouldn't just go outside without telling me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around the house some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I can go down to the entrance of the house from this window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go down to the front of the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't really talked to Ayumi yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll drop straight down to my front door from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My private room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around my room isn't going to get anything done.[%p]
