[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a direct light, but the slight dimness is the one drawback.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light. Indirect lighting has become popular recently, but I'm more practical than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not one indirect light in the house. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I boast about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtains. I don't think now is the time to be worrying about the curtains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The color of these curtains is beautiful. This must be Ayumi's choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi waters these every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's just a keepsake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard can be so traditional about the strangest things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would a non-normal video tape look like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some kind of video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not an 「adults only」 one though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A family picture⋯ Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A family picture⋯ That old bastard is photobombing a picture with Ayumi and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get annoyed just looking at it. I should ignore it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A needlessly large TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No reason to watch the TV now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A useless TV that plays nothing but local channels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep seeing news about Geo Technics being criticized on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure there's no end to Ayumi's anxiety.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It smells like Ayumi a little bit. *sniff* Hahhh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a soft couch. I'm sleepy just sitting on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I shouldn't sit down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These cushions are so nice and soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi always sits on these⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And once she leaves, I bury my face in them. I love it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That just makes me a weirdo though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to sit down now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair I can use to sit at the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At Ayumi's height, her toes can barely touch the ground sitting on this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's always swinging her feet in the air like a little kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't cook, so this is no use to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can do is spin it atop a chopstick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These are plates for food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi puts the food she cooks on these.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not very thirsty, so I'll just leave it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd love to be drinking with Ayumi, just the two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she only sees me as her stepson.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge looks empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anything is inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh my god![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll buy juice next time I'm out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I'm on my period.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to have a staring contest with the calendar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still so hot this season. I hope it cools down soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Although I'll probably be hoping it warms up once it starts getting really cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light. No need to turn it on now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fluorescent lights aren't good for places where you eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes your food look unappetizing. Yellow lighting is better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know art too well, so I should leave this alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is some kind of ethnic thing my old man brought home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be some kind of art piece. I don't know anything about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living room light isn't exactly dim, so I guess this is just for design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi likes green. She doesn't like sticky green stuff though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Neither do I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi likes this kind of stuff. She really likes green, I know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember one time when I handed her some green slime. She let out a nice scream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a pretty steep staircase. Going up to the second floor is tiring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I said that, Ayumi told me I sounded like an old man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a spiral staircase.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One time, I tumbled down these steps like a soccer ball.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rolled right into the china cabinet, and all the dishes crashed down on top of me. The broken pieces really cut me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi was laughing pretty hard until she saw how badly I was hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't slide around though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hardwood floor. It's nice and cool on my bare feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be too cold to stand on in the winter though. What a selfish floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to order delivery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at the phone makes me want to order food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cordless handset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We get lots of prank phone calls lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who would do such a thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no use for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The counter is for eating and drinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi loves shopping for plates and pans and stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's quite a bit piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One time, I tumbled down these steps like a soccer ball. I rolled right into the china cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the dishes crashed down on top of me, and the broken pieces really cut me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the stairs and the china cabinet remind me of that day⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the living room won't do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I just go to the police?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing for me to do in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already read my old man's letter. I know where to go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no turning back now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, maybe I can think better in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just got down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's there. It was a waste even going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really mind, but I doubt anyone is there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she's not back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Where did she go?[%p]
