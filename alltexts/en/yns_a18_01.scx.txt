[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see Triangle Mountain, aka Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater to block high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our town is on the right. I guess it's for high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants are growing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass down the stairs here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sand is shining in the sunlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction takes away the refreshing feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a date spot at night before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck must be for moving earth and sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if they just leave it out here, it'll be bad for the engine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That ocean breeze always blows at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is quiet. I can hear the waves whispering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the proper name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost nobody around here calls it that, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the sights of Sakaimachi. It's known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. It's night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what a geological survey looks like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like they could do it on a smaller scale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the construction site's fence. Apparently they're doing a geological survey inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what I saw from the rooftop, it looked like they're digging up the beach for all its worth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beach is quiet. Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any reason to go to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I feel like my old man's writings pointed to a different place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's the right way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like my old man's writings were pointing me somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, I'm going back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to my old man's writings, something will happen if I collect ten Jewels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ten Jewels⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are ten Jewels embedded in the Reflector.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's go check out Triangle Mountain![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I have all ten Jewels yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should just go to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I get the feeling that I have to go to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should just go to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should just go to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
