[name]Takuya[line]That's right, I have the 20th page for a document⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It fits right in. So this was part of a larger document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never bothered reading what was the page⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's written on it?[%p]
「⋯ I'll record the Hypersense Stone's liquid preservation equation here.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Hypersense Stone. I've seen this weird word before⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it could be⋯[%p]
「This highly volatile rock can be preserved in a stable state by using the reaction formula below.」[%p]
「However, the success rate is less than 1 percent, and if the procedure fails⋯」[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the sound of someone putting a card in the door mechanism.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯someone's coming?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'll just hide behind that big desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, I dropped some papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it, I can't go back and get them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could be coming here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it might be Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it is, I feel like I don't have to hide⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nope, no way. Even if it is Ayumi, I still broke in here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And if it isn't Ayumi, it'll be trouble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hmph, looks like nobody's here. But the occupied sign was green⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]They're gone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, that voice.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]They're not here. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's he doing in Ayumi's office?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like he's looking for something.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]I know the documents were supposed to be in here⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]If they aren't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Documents?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does he mean what I have in my hand?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They were what Ayumi was holding so closely⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does Toyotomi want with them?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then again, he is Ayumi's subordinate⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It wouldn't be strange for him to come to her office to grab some documents.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯something seems off.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Could she have done it herself? No, I would've heard about it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Which means, it's time for the contingency plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he talking about?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Hmm, what's this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He saw the papers I dropped!)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Ah, the documents⋯but why are they on the ground?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]I see, looks like the contingency plan has already begun⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Now it makes sense that the light was green.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. Now he notices the details.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Come out. I don't know who you are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]And I don't know where you're hiding, but I'll call security if you don't come out.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Which means you'll be placed under arrest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. If he calls security, I'm screwed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it'd be the same if I went out there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, hold on⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why hasn't Toyotomi called security yet?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If there's an unknown intruder in the room⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ordinarily, you would immediately call security.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he talking to an unknown intruder?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be a reason Toyotomi can't call security.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi's Voice[line]Hmph, the silent treatment, huh? You really want me to call them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll get caught no matter what I do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that's the case⋯ Maybe it's time for a gamble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hi, Mr. Porn Director.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, it was you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now comes the crucial moment.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use :selitem: for :selatr:⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off, what am I supposed to do with :selitem: on :selatr:?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's give it some more thought⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I don't think those go together very well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't use :selitem: there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't supposed to be used for :selatr:, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't something I can use now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening⋯ Well, that's not surprising.[%p]
