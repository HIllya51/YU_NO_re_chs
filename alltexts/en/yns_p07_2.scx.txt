[name]Takuya[line]I was looking for Ayumi, if I remember correctly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see any students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone's probably out enjoying summer vacation. Dammit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because classes are over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barely any students around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up goes to the roof, down leads to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't stare at stairs, you use them to go up or down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an emergency exit sticker here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can get outside the school from here, using this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not an emergency right now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should use the stairs instead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door in front leads to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They call it a research laboratory, but that's just where teachers hang out. It's not like there are any beakers nor test tubes in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This door leads to the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go down to the first floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, go up to the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do up there.[%p]
