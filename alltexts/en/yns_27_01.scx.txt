[name]Takuya[line]I can see my whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be romantic if I was here with a girl⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I shouldn't be saying that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to the Heights?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see my whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view at night is pretty from here. It'd be romantic if I was with a girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see my whole town from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be romantic if I was here with a girl⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like those yakuza types aren't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is that Toyotomi guy in the park at night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see my whole town from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view at night is pretty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. Nothing interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A utility pole. Having fun looking at it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house is the perfect picture of a huge mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear her father is the mayor of this city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Politicians make a lot of money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Princess Shimazu's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I gave in to temptation and went there once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a super big mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki's probably in there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are probably lots of couples out tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi was talking to what I can only imagine were yakuza members there last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a ton of couples got together again today. Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Meiunji Park, where couples gather every night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The characters mean 「bright clouds.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of men and women hoping fate will bring them together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Meiunji Park, where couples gather every night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The characters mean 「bright clouds.」 There are lots of men and women hoping fate will bring them together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are tons of couples getting together again today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like a park that impedes a guy's healthy development.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the promise of the prosperity of mankind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! Don't they ever get tired of all the hugging and kissing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, looks like another couple hoping to prosper went into the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way it's Yuuki and Mio. Hahaha, that's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are three people, which means⋯ It's an orgy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But all three are guys, and that guy in the lead⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Agh, I rubbed my eyes and now my vision's even more blurry. I can't see very well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But one of those three guys⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious. He wouldn't be out here peeping at this hour⋯ Actually, he might.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the yakuza from last night will be there. But I still don't want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, just for a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really have anything to do there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the park at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, it's no good now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those yakuza guys might still be wandering around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's a good idea right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I kind of hate that guy, and I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go over this guardrail and down that grassy hill, it's right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This apartment building always interested me. It's bigger than most.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an expensive-looking building. I wonder what kind of people live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get there from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a bird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the coastline over there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The next town is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fact is it feels good just looking at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view from here is pretty good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say that gazing at the sky will clear your mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But looking at the sky won't clear away what I went through today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way I could get to the ocean from here is to fly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little far from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at it won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what the people living in this city are thinking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do they live their lives?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many houses. It's distracting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The distraction isn't a big deal, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People live in each and every one of these houses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And every one of those people is living their own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like me to think like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This town never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no guarantee that will always be the case, especially for me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that interesting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back into the city.[%p]
