[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why was Toyotomi there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Meeting those guys in the park at night⋯seems like a dangerous combination⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi is standing under the light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he up to?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hm, they're late.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If they're keeping me waiting⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm good at keeping women waiting, but I don't like waiting myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He looks like he's waiting for someone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But who would come to the park at night?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It couldn't be those yakuza⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it is, I'm catching them in the act. They can't plead innocent now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Sorry I'm late.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Do you know long I've been waiting?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]That's why I apologized.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That woman, that's⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]May I sit?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Fine, but let's get down to business.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You're impatient. Well, don't mind if I do.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Now then, I'll listen to you. You called me, so I'm sure you have a nice explanation for it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Then let's hear it⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. Sunglasses at night? That's elaborate.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]It's good manners. It lets you know I'm being cautious, doesn't it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You didn't need to tell me that.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hehe. Now that you mention it, you're right. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's definitely that Kaori woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's the popular anchor on News Presence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing here⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And with Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Where would Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not downtown. I looked all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, where would I go if I were Mio?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right, sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's no one in the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Yuuki searching?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staying here like this won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know Toyotomi was wearing a wig.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night in this park⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's just children and mothers now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just children and mothers now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess I'll go back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's full of children and mothers during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It changes instantly into a date spot at night, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi and those yakuza were talking here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like they're not here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staying here won't help anything. I should go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I know I heard a scream. It came from this park![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The woman who screamed should still be here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯ Where are you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just talking to that Kaori woman here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like there's no one here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's kinda weird.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Three guys in a park where only couples gather⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And it's that nasty Toyotomi bastard⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he in the park this late at night?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, once I go over this fence, I'll be in the park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I won't be able to rest until I see it with my own eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's definitely Toyotomi. There's no mistaking that stiff suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But who are the other two?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a fat one and a skinny one.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They look like they're bad news.)[%p]
