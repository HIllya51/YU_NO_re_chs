[name]Mio[line]That feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But the ocean is so dark it feels like I could get sucked in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You have something to tell me, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So do I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, do you want to meet at the lab around noon tomorrow?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you planning?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I have a theory I want you to hear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, a theory.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I visited Headmaster Ryuuzouji's house the other day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes. There's a certain tapestry in his house. Do you know about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing you told me about in your room?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yep. It's a piece of art for decorating walls and things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what about that tapestry?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It dawned on me when I saw that picture at Headmaster Ryuuzouji's house. Or more like, I was coming closer to believing that theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of picture is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's hard to put into words. But I made a rough sketch of the picture. I plan to ink it tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I can see that tomorrow, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That tapestry⋯seems like it's been passed down many generations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Many generations?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Perhaps the ancient peoples were trying to tell us something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The tapestry in Ryuuzouji's house, huh.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's already late tonight, and dark, so we'll go to Triangle Mountain tomorrow afternoon. Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Someone's there. Look, right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There are some people around the truck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's right. Looks like they're putting something on the truck.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they doing?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Oh!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's wrong?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Over there. Isn't that Mr. Toyotomi?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((That guy giving orders like he's the big boss?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Yes.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((He's in that stiff-looking suit. It must be Toyotomi.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((I wonder what they're doing.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah. It's so late, and they're not using many lights.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((That's odd. There wasn't any notice of nighttime construction tonight.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Which means they don't want to be noticed.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Does that mean⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((That's right. Looks like it's not exactly on the straight and narrow.))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen, we're working tonight.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, if it's orders then we'll follow.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But why so late at night?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's what the company wants. If we transport it quickly, we should be able to keep the loss in the quality of the ore to within ten percent.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But there's always accidents during transportation.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's a baseless rumor. You haven't been here that long, you don't understand what the real work's like.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, it's a job, I guess.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* Yeah, at least it's overtime.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Gotta put food on the table. Let's shut up and work.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, and hurry up. We can't let the local residents catch us.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder if you're really gonna give us that bonus.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Of course I will.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But there was just a lightning strike this afternoon.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah. Working right after an accident. That's not good.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, we're doing it for twice the normal pay.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Stop grumbling and work. I'll reward you well.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, you there! Never let that ore near the water! It'll degenerate before you know it.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Of all the places we could mine this, it had to be near the ocean.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I can only think it's the work of a devil.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((What is that?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((They're right in the middle of some not-so-good work.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((What does that mean?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's that bastard Toyotomi thinking?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so late⋯and they're hiding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they trying to transport?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Oh, looks like the truck's moving.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Looks like they're moving something to somewhere.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((That's a lot of pronouns.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Well, I don't know so there's nothing I can do.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((What are they trying to transport?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((They've left.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((It might be a better idea not to go out.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((That's a safe bet. It'd be a lot of trouble if we got caught.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's so bright all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that tremor just now? Was it an earthquake?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A-Arima, over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]The truck⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck is⋯on fire.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's on fire![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see that! What happened? Was it an explosion?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, it was lightning. Lightning struck it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Lightning struck it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That couldn't have happened. The sky is clear as can be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Look at all the stars.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How could this happen? It's a starry night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just thinking the same thing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Maybe it wasn't lightning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. When the sky lit up for a second, I heard a huge explosion and the ground rumbled.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So it must have been lightning, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, it was definitely lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's your proof?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I've heard of things like this. Most lightning strikes occur during transportation work, or so they say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of bull crap is that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, think about it. Why would a natural phenomenon like lightning care about the conveniences of humans?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then how do you explain this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How should I know?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's irresponsible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not lightning.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahh! Embers are flying![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dangerous here. We should head back.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty huge deal, so I'm sure someone already called 911.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, I hope everything is okay⋯ Gaaah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think I twisted my ankle when the explosion happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your ankle?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ow⋯oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't push yourself. We need something to keep your leg still.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It hurts⋯badly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, let's go to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. It's not far from here, and there's at least some medical equipment there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But it's already night time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There should be a teacher on night shift. Oh wait, Ms. Eriko isn't there right now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But Mitsuki should be there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means the lock should be open.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are we going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just head over to the school for now. That's the closest solution we have.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here, lean on my shoulder.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oww.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, I'm⋯oww![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you twisted it in a weird way. If we can splint it and put a cold patch on it, it'll feel a lot better.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait⋯ Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-Not there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not where? Oh⋯my hand on your back?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's on my butt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, this isn't the time for that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But you're grinning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. You won't get away so easily if you do anything weird to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We just need to go to the school infirmary for now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The one problem is that Ms. Eriko still has a bad habit of wandering about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How undignified. It hasn't even been 10 minutes yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, the thing on my back is really heavy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?! I only weigh–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're going to tell me how much you weigh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's just hurry to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you really not going to finish the rest of the sentence?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ow⋯ Hey, be gentle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gentle, so it doesn't hurt? Hey, is this your first time?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll slap you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm so scared.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's unlocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be Ms. Eriko. She's probably cutting out on work with one of her 「walks.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So there might not be anyone in the school infirmary now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll have to go there to find out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's dark, so watch your step.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whooooaaa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you calling an idiot? Only idiots call people idiots.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is this the time for stand up comedy? Ooo, right there. My ankle is starting to throb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your what is starting to throb?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't hear you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Psh. Let's just go to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the deal with Ms. Eriko? She must be off on one of her walks.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It hurts so bad. Set me down on the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Sorry, I didn't notice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew![%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hey, you make it sound like you were carrying some heavy luggage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was super heavy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't get so mad. I'm just kidding. You were lighter than a sumo wrestler.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That isn't any better. Don't compare me to a sumo player.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're called sumo wrestlers. People will think you've got no common sense if you call them sumo players.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're the one with no common sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever. Let me see your leg.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to look at it if we're going to fix this, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No. Don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't what? I have to look if we're going to fix this, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You never answered my second question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was it again?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, don't talk with that tone. You're a lady.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, really.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Really, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with that?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mhmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*wince*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's nothing between Ms. Ichijou and you anymore?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, nothing at all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm serious.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You stuttered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, I believe you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say believers shall be saved.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, can I ask you one thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me just say that I haven't been doing it in the morning lately.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, was that not what you were going to ask?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't know what you're talking about, but I wanted to ask you about the club.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The club?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why did you quit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I find myself asking the same question.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There were a lot of groupies in that club.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Groupies? For who?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Gosh. Arima, you can be so slow sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, you mean groupies for me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They think you're hot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop joking around. I'm the walking libido, you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That just goes to show how strange girls can be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So who are all these groupies of mine? Tell me their names and what class they're in.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't get so mad.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem. Oh well. Anyway.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you one of my groupies?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You⋯of course not, you idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How unfortunate. I guess I'm just not very attractive.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Well, just a little. I was⋯kind of a groupie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a little?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, just a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. So what's so good about a guy like me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-It's like⋯ My heart races just looking at you and⋯oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't make me explain it! I-It was a joke![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You stuttered.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is kind of fun.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm surprised.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]By what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought you were a calm, logical, and rational thinker.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So you're saying I'm panicky, emotional, and irrational now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, but if I had to choose, I'd prefer that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I figured out the answer to the first question.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The first question?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, about why I'm so involved with Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I said it was because I wanted to help you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There were other reasons Triangle Mountain had my interest. But now, I'm mostly interested in helping you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't need your sympathy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not sympathy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Love.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wha⋯you⋯quit messing around![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, we should quit joking around.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Nothing. I just feel like an idiot for thinking you were serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, you looked very hopeful for a second there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't be ridiculous![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yeah, ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I decided I wasn't going to look back anymore. That was another answer to that question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That you focus on something without paying attention to anything else?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's right. That's not all though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm listening.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? If you're just curious, I won't say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I really want to know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just promise you'll never tell this to anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll never tell anyone.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I trust you. It's about my dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your dad?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mind you, he's my biological father, not a sugar daddy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm ashamed to say that he's brought disgrace upon my family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My dad seems to be involved in some corruption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]cor-erection?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In one ear and out the other.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please continue.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Apparently the rights to construction under Geo Technics and the ownership of the land and stuff was all in legal conflict.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you know that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I heard my dad talking on the phone one time when I was walking by his office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I even saw the financial records. My dad is pretty methodical, so he kept track of all that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you tell that to your dad? About what you know?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's only a matter of time though. I can just tell, seeing him act so frantic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think I'll have to leave Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How would I be able to show my face around here if I stayed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't care. We don't live in some ancient, autocratic state. There's no reason for you to bear the shame of your father's crime.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wish everyone were like you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But, there's nothing I can do about it. That's why I want to do everything I can while I'm still this young.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, everything. That's why I'm going to run. I don't care if it's pointless. I can think about whether there was a point or not later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I had to guess, I'd say your ancient history maniac blood is boiling, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's so bad about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing, it's good. Very good.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Enough of that. Now, one more question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you remember Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhhh⋯ahem. Let's talk about the weather, shall we?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Forget it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you have anything to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, I haven't seen Mitsuki since then. We haven't talked at all since then.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you like her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you saying? That's out of nowhere![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you love her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Whaaaa?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, you keep your expression pretty calm when you ask such weird questions. I'm not old enough for love.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not fair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure it is. I think I'm just recognizing my current situation. I can't even provide for a woman yet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So you love her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you say that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because I really want to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you remember what I told you before?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That you wanted to be able to talk to me about stuff?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. To be honest, right after that, I saw you and Ms. Ichijou doing⋯umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Having an affair.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing to cry about though, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wasn't crying because I saw you liked someone else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what was it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because after running as fast as I could, it showed me how pointless it was to run, and the frustration made me cry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Now the other question. Why am I in such a hurry?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Before I answer that, let me ask you something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you interested in this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It might just be some ancient history maniac's nonsense about Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But what made you so interested in it? You were scoffing at me two months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I just got curious?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Impossible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that was really the case, what would you do?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'd strip naked and run ten laps around the school while doing a handstand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well you better strip. I'm telling the truth.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't hear you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Come on, why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I stick my nose into all this stuff?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's got me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell her it's because I saw that naked lady.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I said it was because I was interested in you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not curious about what you're researching. I'm curious about you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What are you saying? Give me a break with your jokes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her voice just got pitchy.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Now, for the first one. That opinion that there's no point because it's been researched so many times in the past.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The case is actually that Triangle Mountain hasn't been researched much at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It hasn't been?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's right. Do you know why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, because of my old man.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sorry, that was rude of me. Let's change the subject.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to worry about me. Triangle Mountain hasn't been researched because of my old man's theory, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's right⋯ I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just facts. Theories of a misfit researcher get purposely ignored, huh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Apparently, Dr. Arima was considered extremely heretical in the academic world. That's why they ignored him and ended funding for his research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess everyone would laugh at you when you say that the secrets of humanity from 400 A.D. are resting in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well I don't agree. I think Dr. Arima's theory is convincing and appropriate, deserving of proper research.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, it was always that old bastard's dream to have a cute, young girl on his side.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-Nothing. Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]After you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sorry, I just want to look at the ocean. I am listening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said before that there's something at Triangle Mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you think is there?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I guess you could say I agree with your father's hypothesis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, that humanity's secrets lie there?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can I say two things?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain has been researched a ton of times in the past. There's no way you could discover anything new about it at this point.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, you may be right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One more thing. Why is this necessary for you to do? It seems like you're in a rush or something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wow, you're sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could just take your time researching it later. Triangle Mountain isn't going anywhere.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wonder if that's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, I'll answer each one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The wind is a bit strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It must be the wind. Her hair is flowing so elegantly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should quit while Mio is still mild.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to hear more from her anyway.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's your excuse for looking at my underwear this time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She caught me.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You slouch a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I just thought I saw a clam.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph, a clam, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thank god she doesn't know.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you looking at the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I saw an ark clam.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. An ark clam, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thank god she doesn't know.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, don't lift your leg up that high.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You're getting me excited.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to give it a rest.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If you touch me again, I'll do a lot more than just punch you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a look![%p]
[name]Mio[line]No way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look small, but they have a surprising volume to them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They must be around 32 or 33.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There.[%p]
*boink*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah, ah, oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ohhh, feeling it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sh-Shut up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That hurt a little bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if she gets sand in her panties.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's not wearing stockings, probably because it's still hot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm, I'm sure any other guy would revel at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Short skirts are nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like her skirt is a little short.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe that's what's popular right now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so white and fragile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so white and fragile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The dark sky stretches on forever.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is staring far into the distance.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you like gazing at the sky, too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't hate it. What about you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I like it. I especially love a dark, star-filled sky above the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*thump thump*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It makes my own existence feel so small. All those things I worry about suddenly seem so stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sometimes I cry when I look at the sky. Do you get that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think so.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe, you're so strong Arima. Maybe that doesn't apply to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's still hot, so the fabric is thin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm talking about Mio's dress.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not too flashy, with just a hint of womanly charm.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A light post.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Another light of the many around here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It dimly illuminates the coast.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess it acts as an embankment, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is a very thick, concrete wall.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It runs parallel to the coast.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The ocean is so dark.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so calm tonight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The coast is quiet. Mio and I are all alone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're not doing construction right now, after all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio and I are all alone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her pale legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My eyes prize her thighs, I look and she sighs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯ Let's ignore what I just said.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her expression is calm, but it looks like she wants to say something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to her.)[%p]
