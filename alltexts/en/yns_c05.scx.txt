[name]Takuya[line]I don't remember having anything to do at the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. A place Mio would go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not in the city, I checked every shop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll try looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*wheeze⋯wheeze* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock is in place, so I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, where is that ancient history-obsessed girl hiding?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be evening soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I'm out at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be evening soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, I heard Yuuki is looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did he go home already?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's inside the school anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The coincidences just don't stop. I see you often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Slacking off as usual, I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm not slacking off. I'm on a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So the teacher is posing as a bad example for us. Hmmm, that's deep.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I just like taking walks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you go to that samurai mansion again?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, that area is perfect for taking a walk. It's very convenient⋯hmm? What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You seem less energetic than usual. Hehe, did your girlfriend dump you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, why do you look like I scored a bull's-eye with my words?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Wait, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. She wasn't my girlfriend, either.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph. It seems complicated. Well, you're only young once, so enjoy it while it lasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those words don't suit you at all.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't say that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh yeah, I need to tell you something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yuuki was just looking for you at school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki was? What an idiot. He should have gone somewhere I usually go.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey. First of all, you had an obligation to be at school, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll pass on the lectures. So what did he want?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It seemed like it was urgent, whatever it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it have been?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay. Time to go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll go to the school infirmary later. I have some things to do in the school for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So Yuuki was looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was in a rush. I wonder what it's about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics executive board meeting should be ending right about now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi went after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Yuuki was looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here. Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi definitely got the wrong idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, to be honest it wouldn't really be the wrong idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to fix this misunderstanding tonight.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you're standing in the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm Eriko. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well well, excuse you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, do you know Ayumi? My stepmother?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That, I don't know. But I do know your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, I'm not a kid. You could answer me a little more seriously.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm as serious as can be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school physician slipping out of school? You're just as bad as always.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm on a walk, just going over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there? So you went to that creepy mansion?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sure. It stinks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stinks?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah. It reeks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't smell anything, however⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't have to finish that thought. But look at you, skipping classes as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't deny that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Your little underling was looking for you inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My underling?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yuuki. Poor kid. I think he's still sitting in for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You should say something to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So Yuuki was looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could he want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there are some people in the school. Must be club kids.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm at the front gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I got kicked out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The doors should be locked already. Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's coming out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is that you, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were still in school?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You say it like I shouldn't have been.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never said that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You always say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do things have to be so difficult?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* This always happens when I talk to Mio.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This always happens when we talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did the chicken cross the road? To avoid lame and outdated jokes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that things are nice and calm, where's your guy today?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're so weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki was looking for you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki is⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Miss Miiiooo![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that voice.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff, huff*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki, get it together.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm going to get reprimanded for sitting in for you, so I don't know if I can come with you today.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Right. I feel sorry for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Mio. Because you skipped class, Yuuki got in trouble.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's okay, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm going to go home after the teacher yells at me some more, so I won't be able to go searching Triangle Mountain with you, Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Search Triangle Mountain?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh yeah, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Can you take Miss Mio with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Me?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. It's dangerous at night, so I was hoping that the Boss Man could use some boss powers to make sure she's safe.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know she won't like it because she's such a princess.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I thought Arima wouldn't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Neither do I. If that's what you want to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What are you two mumbling about? Please make sure she gets home safe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't mind taking Mio home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's mostly my fault Yuuki got in trouble, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?)[%p]
I'll go instead of Yuuki⋯
I'll bring Mio back home⋯
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go make sure the teacher knows it was my fault.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wait. You will?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'm the one who asked you to sit in for me. It's partly my fault you got in trouble.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't try to look so cool. It's partly my fault, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll only complicate things, Mio. I'll be able to throw them off track more easily by myself.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But⋯will you be okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's best to just say it's all my fault.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, I guess⋯owowow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get going then.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]A-Are you sure, Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me say it again.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell are you doing?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's because you've been avoiding me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Being hugged by a guy doesn't make me happy, you know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I, Masakatsu Yuuki, would like to escort Miss Mio home safely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong Mio? Disappointed?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Don't be ridiculous! Let's go, Yuuki![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, Miss Mio⋯ Thank you so much, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, just hurry up and go.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said the teacher got angry at him, but who was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it the guidance counsellor or the remedial class teacher?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, nothing to sweat over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take Mio back to her house.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank ye so much, Boss Man![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well then, I've ta get goin' for me spankin'.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it's a big deal, but you keep sounding weirder as you speak.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay then. Boss Man, Miss Mio, see you around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Yuuki left.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's get going.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? Go where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your house, duh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]R-Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with her?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]All right, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh, going off on your own, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. A promise is a promise. I guess I'll take you home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Ayumi say she's got some kind of briefing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what that's about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Ayumi say she's got some kind of briefing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what that's about.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Try being a little careful you⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What a coincidence. You're from the Citizen's Association, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]The company briefing is about to begin. I'm about to go there for an interview.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The briefing?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]As citizens, we have a right and duty to protect our views. We have to protest what Geo Technics is doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, but I⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Come on, you should be there, too. The more people, the more effective we'll be.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Try being a little careful you⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This lady is⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What a coincidence. You're from the Citizen's Association, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The company briefing is about to begin. I'm about to go there for an interview.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The briefing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]As citizens, we have a right and duty to protect our views. We have to protest what Geo Technics is doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, but I⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Come on, you should be there, too. The more people, the more effective we'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She just talked at me without listening at all. What a selfish woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that company briefing she mentioned?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the same as what Ayumi said she'd be doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, I keep seeing you today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've been relatively busy myself. I find that I'm in and out of the school quite a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Also, I live nearby, so I get called back right away when something happens. Keeps me busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Why are you staring at me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd like to ask you one thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't happen to go to the shrine last night, did you?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was at home all night. I'm actually afraid of the curse, so I rarely go out at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curse?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, you don't know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've sorta heard of it.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Two people have already died. Can't be too careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You asked if I went to the shrine. Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all I wanted to know. I have to go to my remedial class now.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. Well, study hard. I'm sure Koudai is counting on you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Takuyaaa![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Nothing is with me. I've been attending third year remedial classes for you, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How considerate of you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ahem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, was Mio taking remedial classes, too?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. Don't expect any thank-you cards from me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's that over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna and Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio seems to be yelling her head off about something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, they're coming this way.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Awh, she left⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mio.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, my lady. What a fine day to be in a good mood.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't act so refined.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, ugly bitch.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mio[line]Who are you calling an ugly bitch?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the one who told me not to act refined.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's such a thing as moderation, you know![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How selfish. *grumble*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you grumbling about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grumble grumble*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of moron?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's so like you to eavesdrop on us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just happened to be walking by while you two were arguing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This has nothing to do with you, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't intend on asking about it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just can't seem to like her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Different strokes for different folks, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No. It's not a matter of subjectivity. It's a matter of principle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Principle?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She's not the kind of pure girl you think she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just the other day, she⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never mind. I don't like talking about people behind their backs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you just arriving at school now? You're so lazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you having fun at remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then why are you attending? I mean, you're taking classes voluntarily, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Well⋯ I'll go through hell and high water for my studies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something is ringing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]R-Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hell and high water, huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yeah, I get it. I just need to go to class, right? You should go to class, too, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I say something strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is she angry like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi said she was doing inspections, so there's only one place she could be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go right away![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school gate. Isn't Ayumi inside the school?[%p]
