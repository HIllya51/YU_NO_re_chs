[name]Takuya[line]I'll be in the school hallway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where do you plan to go from here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a fun class just ended⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like everyone left in a hurry to enjoy their summer break⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds like Mitsuki is looking for me⋯ Wonder what she wants from me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hall is so quiet now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's not like this place had any students hanging out in halls anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quiet school hallways are pretty creepy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The roof's at the top of stairways, past the school hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're supposed to climb stairs, not stare at them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an emergency exit sign⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you can go outside from here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's not like it's an emergency right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's use the stairs to move around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the door to the lab⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you stop looking and just move?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right⋯ Let's go to the 1st floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll head to the roof⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used to hang out here when Mitsuki was still teaching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really have any business here⋯ Shall we go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, let's go to the lab.[%p]
