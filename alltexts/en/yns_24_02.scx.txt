[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, this isn't where I'm meeting Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that was a workout, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that always tires me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the top of the hill at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm beat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the top of the hill at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm beat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surprisingly dark. I wish it were brighter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light post. It'll probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime now, so the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lights are shining. It looks like bugs are gathering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's relatively high, and also those are barbed wires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks to be used as a guard fence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it surrounds the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barbed wires at the top of the wall, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's charged with a high-voltage current like in the movies, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't look at it too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of the light post, I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps it is wired in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯ Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics Japan Geological Engineering Laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can climb over it easily, but that might cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it's easy to climb over, that's why I should be cautious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I try going over it, they might shoot me with a laser or something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I could easily go over this railway crossing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But as soon I try going over it, the guards will jump on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she is watching TV as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it her job to watch TV at the guard house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. Wait, there's a guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, this is the guard house, so there should be a guard, of course.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, you again. Whew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look kinda tired.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, I am⋯ I let a gangster sneak in last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A gangster? Were they riding motorcycles?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That's not what I mean! I'm talking about an illegal intruder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone broke in?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes. I was caught off guard and someone got inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you were watching TV.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Excuse you! I was only watching TV for a little while and they took advantage of–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you actually were watching TV?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Ahem, I have to go back to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this company okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An intruder, huh? I wonder who it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The guard is watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, the security at this company is not too strictly enforced.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's try this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! What the heck are you doing?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh! Yes, I uh, I've been reserving my energy to prepare for unexpected situations and⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You! If you do that again, I'm going to call the guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What you just said⋯doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Shush⋯ This TV drama is just now getting to the best part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, for real? I guess the security at this company is not strictly enforced at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's watching TV again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should teach her a lesson.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! The chief is here![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yes, chief. Have a good day at work sir⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, I don't have time for this. You shouldn't mess with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right, you're busy watching TV.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Please⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is kind of fun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know she's not going to be here anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's thrown her legs on the desk and is watching TV. Is that really a way to serve as a security guard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she saw me.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, it's you again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well hello. It looks like you're not here that much during the daytime.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm often working security inside during the day. Whew, I feel like I'm working more than I get paid for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, you're the head facilitator's son, right? Don't tell her what I said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't say anything. I understand where you're coming from.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're already on the company's private property, so don't stay here too long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nobody's in the guard house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a storehouse for security guards⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like anyone's here right now. What happened to that security guard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big antenna⋯ I don't think it's for watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big parabolic antenna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they are doing satellite communication with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dome. But I don't know what they use this for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dome like a planetarium attached to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what they use it for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like my school, the building height doesn't exceed four stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are ordinances that state the maximum height of buildings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I climb up here, I can probably get to the entrance of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope⋯ I thought I nearly died climbing all the way here, and there's still more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I get to the company building, I'm gonna pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like some kind of directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't find anything in a shrub⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some difficult mathematical equations and graphs written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's numbered 「20」 at the bottom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the 20th page of a document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a document be in the shrub?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Feels nice with lots of green in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is filled with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think these plants are native to around here⋯still, at least the architect has good taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really matches the building in a nice way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring at the sky won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a clear blue sky. If I keep looking at it, I'll end up having neck pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could just disappear into the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is already inside Geo Technics property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't enter even if I'm her immediate family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go inside without permission, I'd cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, staying here won't help at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
