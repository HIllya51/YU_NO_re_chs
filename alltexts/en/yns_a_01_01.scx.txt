[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the original entrance⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can go outside if I turn back, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is wet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's mostly rock instead of dirt⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like water is seeping through, bit by bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't taste salty⋯ Must not be sea water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see, it's too dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check where the flashlight is pointing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'll keep moving ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to go back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be moving forward right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should⋯ I go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A rock is blocking the entrance⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is why I can't go outside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But anyway, I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I feel so calm right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to go back⋯ All I can do now is move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should⋯ I go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I really going to leave after coming this far?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I even come here then⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I have no choice but to keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, really, I don't need to use any items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on⋯ I can't use that right now.[%p]
