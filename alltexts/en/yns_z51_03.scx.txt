[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯ There's no point in being here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just clouds and rocks, everywhere I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear a faint sound, but it's a very quiet place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I look down, I feel like being sucked in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a sea of clouds below.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea how tall this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rocky pillars springing out just like baby bamboo shoots⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how tall that rocky pillar is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Weeds all look the same to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They must all be different kinds of grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The grass in the front looks like where I'm standing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't lean over too far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess I'll go back⋯[%p]
