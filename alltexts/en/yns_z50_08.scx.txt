[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried about Celes. I should return home![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet forest⋯ No monsters have appeared ever since that day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I have to get home now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No went into the forest with Kun-Kun⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, let's head home![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beautiful stream⋯ There were fish swimming in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what happened because of that earthquake⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The nuts and fish in the river are our only source of food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our diet could use some improvement.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is not the time to be staring at the stream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That earthquake was a big one⋯ Let's head home![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind whispers through the trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But now, I'm starting to feel more anxious⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sunshine is spilling through the trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe there was such a large earthquake⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should reach that cliff if I keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This path should take me to that cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know⋯ Let's go back to the hill![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That way leads to the cliff⋯ Wrong direction.[%p]
