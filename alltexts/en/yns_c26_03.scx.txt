[name]Takuya[line](She's right. It doesn't matter who she really is right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything will be fine as long as I can prove Ayumi innocence.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay, I should go to Ayumi Arima's office first.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I push it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Tehehe, it opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can get in now.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Tehehe, thanks. I don't want to force my way in if I can avoid it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I think I have to do something before this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The order isn't right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to use the card here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used the card. Now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm trying to tell you to insert that in here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So what is 「that」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't have the [Magnetic Card].)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means I can't get in here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I can get the [Magnetic Card] somewhere and then come back⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a very thin opening, like a slit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small blue light on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I put that in here⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's you-know-what.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't you have the magnetic card?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Actually, I don't have the [Magnetic Card].)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no. I can't move forward unless I get it from somewhere.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No matter how many times you push it, nothing will change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's not going to open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How does she know that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I tried using the card, but it didn't work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks the same as the device in front.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But over here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small slit there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks just like the device on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this one has a red light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Staring at it will make your eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect brightness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bright light embedded in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]How can I switch it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is quiet.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't forget that I'm here, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm all alone.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, did you forget about me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The red light hurts my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bright red light against the gray wall makes it stand out even more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This really feels like an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Intelligent buildings usually look like this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your school kinda looks like this too, doesn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is closed, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, isn't the door locked?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, that's the laboratory. Isn't that the wrong place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's right. That's not Ayumi's office. Wait a minute.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We did get in here lickity-split.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It wouldn't surprise me if Kaori had the layout of the building memorized.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a second.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Didn't she just say 「the laboratory」?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The laboratory⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Takuya, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't matter to me what Kaori's intentions are.)[%p]
