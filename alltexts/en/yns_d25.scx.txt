[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No luck.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Where would Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not in the city. I checked every shop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll keep looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If anything happens, we should meet at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm inside the caf⑮. This place is somehow very calming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Mio⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, Mio is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is strange. She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I even doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, for the umpteenth time, let's go back to the school.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, did you find the book?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might have to book it out of here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, give me a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* This time I'm really going back to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, where's Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there she is. Right over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There, on the right. Yeah, right there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, did you find the book?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanted to say I'm going to get it right now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll be back.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't forget, it's in the school laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Come on. Back to the school for real this time.[%p]
