[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how much I walk, all I see is the desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to stop talking. It just tires me out.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I⋯ I don't think I can go any further⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay⋯ I'll carry you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No⋯ You can't die here, Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to die some day.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I don't know how many times I've said it, but it's going to be okay.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ Even fake energy is energy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I don't pretend, I'll fall right over.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to stop talking for no reason⋯ I feel bad for Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If we can make it to the Imperial Capital somehow⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm sorry, I drank a little too much⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I even drank your water, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't talk right now; it'll wear you out.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay, I won't⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ If we can make it to the Imperial Capital somehow⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm⋯a little thirsty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, you can drink my water.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm sorry⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you apologizing for? Drinking when you're thirsty is a basic instinct. Any human would do the same.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I⋯ I'm going to be a burden to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I took your water for the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not a burden. I don't want any water today.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I decided how much water to drink each day when I left.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No already drank all of her share⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm fine⋯ But Yu-No⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We just⋯never seem to get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're⋯almost there.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We've had this conversation so many times.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We know that, but we can't help it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We just need a little bit of hope⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No is barely walking by her willpower alone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But how long will that determination last?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No is tired.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to stop talking for no reason⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't talk to her for no reason⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It takes away our strength when we talk⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hmm⋯ Dad⋯ I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]So promise that you won't leave me behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dummy. I could never do that.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right. We've made it this far together, and we'll keep going forward.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I trust you, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ We've made it this far.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just a desert⋯ Quit looking at it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm sick of looking at it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just desert, no matter where I look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to see it anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We'll get to some place, eventually⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe it'll be heaven⋯ Hahaha.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'll be okay. For sure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I die out here, I could never face Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ I know I'll find the Imperial Capital.)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm all out of water.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All out of food.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I ran out of luck, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No⋯ She'll only be able to walk a few more hours.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](With an empty stomach, stress, and mental fatigue⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just can't walk anymore.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The same goes for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've been giving all my food and water to Yu-No for the last few days.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have absolutely no strength left.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You can⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You can leave me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't hear you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off. Don't make me angry.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯ It's because I came with you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't talk. It'll tire you out.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everywhere I look, it's the desert⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's okay⋯ It'll be okay.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'll work out⋯somehow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I don't believe that, I can't go on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How big is this desert?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe if we get to the horizon, the Imperial Capital will be right there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder how far it is to the horizon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I suppose that the world is round, it should be another two and a half miles to the horizon⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But with all the ups and downs in this desert, it would actually be at least twice that distance.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are dunes here as tall as three-story buildings.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia told me that a man would reach the Imperial Capital after walking for a week.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](One week⋯for a grown man, I suppose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm matching Yu-No's pace now, so of course it's taking longer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, if Yu-No hears me sighing, she'll worry even more.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Honestly, I'm feeling overwhelmed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't pin down the horizon because of the heat haze.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's incredibly hot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But at night⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the North Pole, but the temperature drops below forty degrees⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's what makes a desert so scary.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I read about it in books, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doubling the amount of food and water wasn't nearly enough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ I was wrong.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to see it anymore⋯ It's just desert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was Illia wrong about the distance?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe there isn't really an Imperial Capital beyond this place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be that we're just walking around in this huge desert?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just desert, no matter where I look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is this Imperial Capital?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No is gonna collapse if this goes on any longer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got to do something⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not saying I want to cry, but it's close⋯ I'm just stubborn.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a limit to how far willpower can take you.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No is walking next to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks pretty worn out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The hot sand goes on forever⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](On and on⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are only so many places that have deserts this big, even on Earth⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Sahara⋯ The Gobi⋯ Hahaha, geography was not my strongest subject.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just how long does it go on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can feel the sand's heat through my shoes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet I could fry an egg on the sand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The strong sunlight is pouring onto the white sand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It might blind me if I look directly at it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not just sand, but burning sand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temperature is ridiculous⋯ Feels like I'll get burned.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hahaha⋯ I just want to look at the sky.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how many times I look, it's all just blue⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Clouds are gathering⋯ Looks like⋯rain.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, quick! Get the containers ready![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yaaay! Water! It's water, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, keep your mouth wide open![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aaaaahhhh⋯[%p]
*drip*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Come on, come on, come on! Aaahh, you stupid God![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was just for a moment.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But it felt good. I feel a little better⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Can you see that?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it a mirage?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Tell me, tell me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look over there⋯ Right by the horizon. So much green⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you see it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I can see it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That⋯can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]A mirage![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's an oasis![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]An oasis! What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ An oasis is a place in the middle of a desert with a spring of water. It's a place of green where trees grow.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Water![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, hey! Don't run so fast.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yay, I want to jump in the water![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop rushing away, Yu-No![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Whatever, you're running too, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm just⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]And you're smiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sh-Shut up⋯ Just charge for the oasis![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Chaaarrrgge![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We were about to die⋯ Not even God could've guessed how badly we needed this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it have been Celes' doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's what I'll believe. Thank you, Celes⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yaaay! Water! It's wateeeeer![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad! Hurry up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯ Not so fast.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But you're taking your clothes off, too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm just⋯ I need to stretch out first.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ugh, I can't wait anymore![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on, if you rush too much you'll get a leg cramp⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that⋯over there?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ooh, what's wrong now, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ There's a person![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look⋯ There's a person in the water.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You wait here, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Huh? Oh, come on, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](In an oasis in the middle of the desert like this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A person⋯ Not only that, but a woman?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who it could be⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Just who is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hi Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing? Didn't I tell you to wait back there?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No buts.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ooh, but she has a cute butt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah that butt is⋯ Hey![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You look like a pervert, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be nice⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But who is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not a cloud in the sky⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not a single cloud⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a little rain, that's all I ask⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It really is sky-blue⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I never saw the sky this color in the world I came from⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The weather is so nice⋯ It's almost annoying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're moving forward now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're already moving forward.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know how far we have to go⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No need to go right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just keep going forward.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I get it⋯ I should face towards the right, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the same desert⋯ Happy now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the same no matter which direction I face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm going straight forward.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To the right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What will turning right change about anything?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I turn right or left, it's all the same⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So I'm going straight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll arrive somewhere⋯eventually.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hopefully⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no need to turn.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just need to go forward.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I get it⋯ I should face towards the left, correct?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the same desert⋯ Happy now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the same no matter which direction.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm going straight forward.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To the left?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What will turning left change about anything?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I turn left or right, it's all the same⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So I'm going straight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll arrive somewhere⋯eventually.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hopefully⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I stop, Yu-No will worry again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's wrong, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ I, uh, was just taking a little break.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Uh-huh⋯ Tell me when you want to take a rest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't let my daughter worry about me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to stop this now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey⋯ Don't joke around.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stopping here would be the same as committing suicide.)[%p]
