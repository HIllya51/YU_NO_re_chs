[name]Takuya[line]The exit is right in front of us.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]We still haven't found Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, we should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is all wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's mostly rock, not soil.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The floor is slippery⋯ I should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like the water is seeping up from the ground though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Brr⋯that's cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dripping down from above.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is that seawater?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯ Here, taste it. It's not salty.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which means⋯it's rain water?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dumbass. It's groundwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is pretty damp.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I usually slip and fall in places like this.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like water is seeping out little by little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be seawater. It's not salty.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You're going to get sick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be pretty hard to use machinery to dig out this tunnel.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Then, I guess it's natural?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can really call natural.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It reeks of human involvement⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Who could have made it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯have no idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'll keep moving ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I think it's about time we moved on.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Let's be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around a bit more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you thinking of moving on before getting a good look around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around a bit more.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's why you're the Boss Man. You're very careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that. It's better to be overly thorough in situations like this.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm. I'm pretty sure it's blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just checking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just head back for now.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]All right, let's go back then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ Go back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But we just got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
