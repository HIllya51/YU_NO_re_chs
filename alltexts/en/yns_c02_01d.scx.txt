[name]Takuya[line]That's the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this on purpose?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to pick up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, on the counter. The receiver.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really not the time to be looking at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it could be Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll pick up the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Is this the Arima residence?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yes⋯(It's not Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((I'm calling on behalf of Geo Technics.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geo Technics? That's the company Ayumi works for. Why are they calling now⋯?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Forgive me, but are you Mrs. Arima's⋯?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm her stepson. Can I help you with something?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Yes. Is Mrs. Arima in at the moment?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayu⋯ My mother is out right now.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((I see. Please tell her to call Geo Technics when she returns, and that it is an urgent matter.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, all right.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((It's very urgent. Thank you for your time.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They want her to call back right away, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a polite call, but it sounded kinda panicky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a note on the table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be from Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「I'll be working late tonight and going out for dinner, so I left some money on the table for you to eat out.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's staying late at work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm getting a bad feeling about this. That means she's probably with that asshole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew I should have warned her about Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she's staying late for work, that means she's at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, if she's going out for dinner, that means she's downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, what terrible timing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The receiver is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to pick up the phone.[%p]
