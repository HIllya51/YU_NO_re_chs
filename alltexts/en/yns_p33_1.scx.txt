[name]Takuya[line]My father's study⋯ I haven't gone inside in a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's coated in dust and probably has mold and mushrooms growing inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I can cook some of the mushrooms for dinner⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked. I need a key to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Without the key, this door won't open⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key, huh? Where the heck is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I can't get in without unlocking the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm opening it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open. Oh man, are you telling me it's locked?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means it won't open without a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key to the study, the key to the study⋯ Ah, where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of my old man's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lock's not gonna open on its own, so there's no point standing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of my old man's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of my old man's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't we try opening the door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could look around, but I live here, so I don't think it'd do much good⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same second-floor corridor as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the key to the study, so I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the door's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The question is, where's the key?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try to open it first before I start worrying about instruction papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the door won't make it open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not an automatic door, you have to open it with your hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still have a little more time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to go inside my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still have some time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not too late to search for the document in my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside later. Now I have things to do inside the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to my father's study?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, just standing here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go down to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. I guess I'll go down to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to the living room later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to my father's study?[%p]
