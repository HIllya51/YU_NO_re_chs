[name]Takuya[line]I don't know why, but I came to the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I arrived downtown, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't I have somewhere else to be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Ms. Eriko and Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ms. Eriko go?[%p]
Where could she be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's running toward the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right then, the same goes for me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's as lively as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you gonna do?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, excuse me. Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I seem to run into you a lot, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's like you're following me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]A coincidence. I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We happen to be going the same direction.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. Indeed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't like students walking around downtown late at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I suppose that's the best opinion I could expect from a teacher.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You should head home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, he went into the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waiting in a coffee shop is pretty stylish for someone his age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm downtown. It's much more lively at night than during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city is just as lively as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's more lively at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I'm downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's where I should be going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't imagine Mitsuki walking around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already pretty late, but it's quite lively here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The neon sign is bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All of the neon signs are brightly shining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Downtown⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is the perfect example of a city that never sleeps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are neon signs lit up over all kinds of shops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a bad place to just walk around.[%p]
