[name]Takuya[line]I just noticed, but isn't this a little strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get a strange feeling looking at this picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is up with this picture?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, something's not right here. These rocks!
[name]Takuya[line]They're not the Twin Boulders![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are⋯three of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Three rocks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]50 years ago there were three rocks there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]50 years ago?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This picture really is old, but that's just ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way she could have been alive back then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But this is definitely Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shape of Triangle Mountain and the positioning of the Twin Boulders⋯ There's no doubt about it. This picture was taken at Sword Cape for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides the strange fact that there are three rocks instead of two, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe the photo was edited?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's some kind of special effect?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's even more ridiculous. It's not some fishy ghost picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would someone have to do that in the first place? It's not like anyone's going to see it, so there would be no motive to change the picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So does that mean it's real? The wear and tear of it certainly makes it seem so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that would mean this photo was taken 50 some-odd years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way Kanna could have been alive back then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was her mom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of cases where kids look so much like their parents it's creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That could be it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I should put this away. I came in here and looked without permission. What would I say if she caught me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be some kind of mistake. It's probably her mom or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They really look alike though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a rock on either side, like there should be, but what's this rock doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's another rock from Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a rock from Triangle Mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's definitely Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a rock from Triangle Mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The proof is in the etchings on it. It's a famous spot in this town.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be another rock from Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a rock from Triangle Mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna is always wearing a headband.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think there's anything strange about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what about Kanna's headband?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's looking at Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who it could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't explain it, but I'm getting a cute, younger sister vibe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't stare at her breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more than one reason this photo is strange. I should keep an eye out for that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those are some strangely gigantic breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, they're more amazing than strange. She has a nice body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never seen that woman before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The swimsuit shows off the lines of her body nicely. That's a really nice body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm surprised Kanna looks so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's got the perfect waist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And her breasts are a lot more pleasing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯such a tiny waist.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to be lost in idle thought. There are other reasons why this photo is strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm fascinated by her legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's nothing strange about them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish I could see bare legs all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calm down, Takuya. There is nothing strange about this part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to keep staring at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna's stomach.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She has a cute navel, but otherwise, she's got a normal stomach.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her thighs are outstanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's so trim and athletic, like a healthy sexy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing strange about her legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna. Nothing's wrong with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna in a bathing suit. It's pretty obvious she's happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her hair is flowing in the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean breeze is blowing her hair back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She has such a beautiful smile.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen a smile like that on her once or twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's the chick that can make her smile like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Both of them are in bathing suits. Is it a picture from a day at the beach?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is nothing strange about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the Shrine at Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just my finger. Nothing is wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll look at the picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is a strange bracelet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it's made of iron. That's an unusual choice for jewelry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is she hugging?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's hugging someone, and she looks so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is the woman capable of making her smile like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
