[name]Takuya[line](Kaori is right in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with a very slight grin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so modern.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is cute, but I think she might be older than me.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe⋯ You look like you're interested.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want from me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You get right to the point, don't you? What I want from you is the blue card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue card?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. I'm sure Ayumi Arima has it. It's a type of security card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you need a security card for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I need it to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside where?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The lab in Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lab? But you're not an employee, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Right, which is why I need the card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. I want to make sure⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Go for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I may be wrong, but what are you planning to do with that blue card?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I just told you what I plan to do. I plan to get into the laboratory at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The security is tight there. Even if I get past the first layer of security, I can't get past the second layer without that card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I'm getting this wrong, but let me check one more time. You're not planning to enter illegally are you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's exactly what I plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-So you're gonna break into Geo Technics?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I suppose I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you respect me now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I respect you about as much as I do a slug.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sarcasm doesn't work on her.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I plan to break into Geo Technics again tomorrow night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tomorrow? Again?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. Last night was kind of a test, and I was forced to withdraw.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a bold person.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thanks. I'll take that as a compliment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you just broke in tonight.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, and just about anyone would think the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Nobody would expect someone to break in two nights in a row, so I'm going to exploit that fact.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's pretty impressive.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you understand the plan?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just dumbfounded by all this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you stick with me, you'll probably be more dumbfounded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Right, how about around five tomorrow? Let's meet at the Evening Caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The police might show up. Don't you worry I'll tell the cops?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It would be useless. A story doesn't necessarily make you guilty. Not without evidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So, tomorrow at five o'clock. Meet me at the Evening Caf⑮ and bring the blue card. Do you know the caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Evening Caf⑮ is, um⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh well, this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait. Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm going downtown.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Look, that red sign over there is the Evening Caf⑮. They have a great jukebox.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why didn't you say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I don't go to the caf⑮?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you don't come to our meeting, it will be bad for both of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would it be bad for me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If your stepmother has strayed from the moral path, would you really let her keep going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's just your imagination, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But if it's true, you can't take it back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't tell how serious you're being.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm completely serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is doing something illegal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that true?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll bet you're wondering if your stepmother really is doing something illegal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what you're thinking, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't worry. It's my job to know what people are thinking. So, good for us, or bad for us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh! Look at the time. I have a photo shoot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A photo shoot?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Better safe than sorry. See you tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She hurried away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A photo shoot? Better safe than sorry?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She kept glancing at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious. Maybe I should follow her.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Hey, kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it's that guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think his name was Houjou.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Whew! What a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wow, he smells like alcohol.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Who was that hotty? You're pretty smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's none of your business. I'm outta here.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hey, wait a minute. I have to talk to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I don't hurry, Kaori will get away.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I want to talk to you about Kanna. Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](About Kanna?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I do?)[%p]
Chase after Kaori
Talk with Houjou
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I don't have time for you, old man.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]That's cold. Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Later.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]H-Hey, kid![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can deal with that asshole anytime, but Kaori is elusive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should try to follow her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you have to tell me?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh. So this is what happens the moment I mention Kanna's name. Fine then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics is a for-profit business. There's nothing wrong with trying to make a profit.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, there's nothing wrong with making a profit. But what if the way of making a profit was against the law?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Against the law?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Against the law, illegal, call it whatever you'd like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What evidence do you have?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's what I'm trying to confirm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's stupid. I can't help if you're that uncertain.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Think about it. Would such large-scale construction be necessary for a normal geological survey?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ The company decided it was necessary.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Then why are they being so secretive? The locals have been complaining that they're keeping out anyone not involved with the company.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ They're a business. They have the right to protect company secrets.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hm⋯ What about the behind-the-scenes negotiations with the administration? It's strange for the mayor to make the decision arbitrarily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's, uh⋯ The mayor represents the citizens. The mayor's decision is the citizens' decision.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Pfft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You sound just like that construction director, Toyotomi. Your logic is the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You must think it's strange too. Don't kid yourself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Think of it as proving your stepmother's innocence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know Ayumi is innocent. What could she do that'd break the law?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm saying that we should just make sure of her innocence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's more, your stepmother has inherited Dr. Arima's ideas.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, your expression changed. What are you feeling? It's hard to tell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does this have to do with my old man?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I still don't know. But I've interviewed your father before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You interviewed my old man?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, he was an interesting man. Oh, I don't mean to patronize the dead. I have the best intentions saying that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What Geo Technics is trying to do is based on Dr. Arima's theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man's theories?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]To be honest, I'd like to see Ayumi, your stepmother, take her exit soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take her exit? What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I mean, take her exit from this stage, Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't mean to hurt her in any way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How can she say that?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your stepmother is involved in a very serious situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it that bad?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you tell me that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're helping me, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ayumi Arima⋯your stepmother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you know what she does?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works at Geo Technics, a geological company.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Correct. Do you know the details of what she does?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The details?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yeah. Do you know the details of the research she does at the company?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi doesn't really talk about work at home, and I don't ask.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Which means you don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you asking?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm pursuing possible illegal activities at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. It looks like you went all out again tonight.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Teehee, look at you. Ayumi must be an important woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she is. She's family.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to bring me down to the level of a TV reporter?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whatever. Let's get back to the real topic. The construction along the coastline is for the expansion of office buildings, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. You're saying that's not true?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What if I am?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]They're trying to dig something up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. It will make Geo Technics a huge profit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What would make Geo Technics a huge profit?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me say something first.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Go for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The reason I'm with you, Kaori, is because I wanted to clear up a misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What misunderstanding?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to get stuck negotiating unreasonable demands.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Negotiating makes it sound bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what are you trying to say to me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I want to ask you a favor, but only after you've heard what I have to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a negotiation. Sorry, but I won't help you with anything that would be bad for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, so you're a momma's boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's family.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is that really it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Of course that's it. What else would it be?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, my! Now you're angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so difficult.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There might be incredible benefits to doing things that are bad for Ayumi Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't believe that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, listening to me won't cost you anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say there's no such thing as a free lunch.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You sound like an old man. Decide after you've heard me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so shiny it looks like it might sparkle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her mid-length hair is beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's light illuminating it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although I'm very curious to see what's going on inside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should already know the answer to that question.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do that. Be reasonable.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you want to see, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh, what a nice breeze![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. You're very forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're very direct, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, being so straightforward is good once in a while I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa. That's a pretty bold outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't keep myself from staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry, but I can't give you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never said I wanted it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she likes shiny stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Fashionable clothes and shiny jewelry. A very mature combination.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't she get cold with her stomach exposed that much?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No use worrying about that, I suppose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to rub my cheeks against her beautiful navel and then lick it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Psh. Not even in my dreams.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you laughing about all of a sudden? You're so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling she's being provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's that kind of pose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are provocative hands, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful, but I don't know if I can trust her.)[%p]
