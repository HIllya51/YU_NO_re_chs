[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wh-What⋯ What is this?!)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shhh⋯don't say a word.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]O-Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯there's a lady on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ I see that.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aren't you going to help her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what if she attacks us?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line](We have come from somewhere else⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Somewhere far, far away from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Outside of the Border?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](We do not know of this place you call the Border. I cannot answer your question.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, please continue.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](I have crossed the desert to come here⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The desert⋯ The Rafaelo I suppose.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line](And my strength is weak⋯ It will not be long before I go⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line](I do not fear what shall happen to me⋯ But I beg you to take this child and raise her in a safe place⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Child⋯? That creature looks like a lizard.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](This is my child⋯ My dearest child⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Please, I beg you⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine⋯ But you have to answer my question.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](As long as it is within my knowledge⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have wings on your back. What are those?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](This is what I was born with⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bullshit. No human has wings on their back![%p]
[name]Woman[line](I am merely a creation of God⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](The Creator of all things⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not asking about religion here.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](So then, what shall I tell you?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me something else. You said you came from far, far away.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Yes⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is that place?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](It is a place beyond the desert⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond the desert is⋯ The Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](I do not know the word, Imperial Capital⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ No luck here, I guess.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*grunt* (Take my child⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](I can no longer⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, wait a second. We're not done yet.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Go with⋯this man⋯)[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is this thing your child? There's absolutely no resemblance. This can't be true.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Please⋯ Take my child⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! Are you⋯[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Is she dead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I guess so.[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey Dad, what are we going to do about her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Uh⋯ Well.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Please⋯ Take my child⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯ What am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, can I talk to you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know what this means. It means she is going to ask me to do something⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah⋯ I knew it⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We should take care of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take care? It's not like a puppy or a kitten, you know?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯ I feel so bad for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't just have a pet because you feel sorry for it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Having a pet means to be responsible for its life. You cannot give up half way and abandon it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But, she'll die soon if we don't do something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's true⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This poor little guy doesn't know what to do after its⋯mother, I guess⋯just died.)[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](N-No, no no no. I can't let my emotions take over right now.)[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Look at the poor thing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, but⋯ Look, I have no idea how to take care of this lizard-looking thing.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll figure it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Figure it out? I mean, what are we going to feed it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Right⋯ I can't breastfeed yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What?! Of course not![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh! What about Mom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want your mother to breastfeed a lizard?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Well, she's a mom, and I think she can give milk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no, and no.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hmm⋯ What about you, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why in the world would I have to breastfeed it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Umm⋯ Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not just about food. It's also about the environment and things like that⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, Daaadd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't you look at me like that⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, please![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll take care of her, I promise![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I promise to look for food, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'll do laundry and clean the house. I'll even give you a shoulder massage, too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh please Dad, I'll do the best I can![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Okay.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On one condition.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]A kiss?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, what are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Because⋯ You always say that to Mom. You say, 「Oh all right, I'll forgive you if you give me a kiss.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯ As they say, children watch and learn from their parents.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Tell me, tell me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My condition is that Mom has to approve of this first.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I have to ask Mom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. If she doesn't approve, it's a no-go.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay, I'll convince Mom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]C-Convince⋯? (Wonder where she learned that word.)[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, don't you keep crying all day.[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, I know! You're always whimpering so I'm going to name you Kun-Kun. Just like how you cry: 「kuuun, kuuun.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯ Are you sure you want to name it that?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Kun-Kun! Come on, let's go! To a whole new life in a new world![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A whole new life in a new world⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's exactly what happened to me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Yu-No is trying to convince Celes now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That she's going to take care of Kun-Kun until it's a nice big⋯creature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A creature⋯ Hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it really is, that lizard-like animal⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It's about time I gathered my thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](My name is⋯#◇&◎□※☆%⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh! M-My head![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ My head hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop⋯ Stop speaking, please![%p]
[name]Woman[line](My name resonates too deeply within your hearts⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Are you okay, Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yeah, I'm okay now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to tell me your name. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Choose⋯and please answer⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](You may choose to kill me⋯or to receive my hope⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Receive⋯ Hope?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Choose⋯and please answer⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, tell me more about this 「hope」 you speak of. I'm all ears.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Make sure you can run if you need to.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Uh-okay⋯ But what about you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just worry about yourself. Make sure you are safe.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an order from your father.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then⋯ What's the story?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Dear sir⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]My head hurts.[%p]
[name]Woman[line](My dear sir⋯ We have no intention of causing harm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What is this⋯ Where is the voice coming from?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](We have no intention of causing harm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's coming directly through my⋯mind?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](We have no intention of causing harm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](I am speaking directly to your heart⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My⋯heart?[%p]
[name]Woman[line](Please put down that horrifying weapon⋯ We have no intention of causing harm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do that. We may need to defend ourselves. Even if you say you won't hurt us, it's not like I can suddenly start trusting you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can she not speak⋯?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crying like a lost puppy⋯)[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that all she can say?[%p]
[name]Left Creature[line]*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Crying like a lost puppy.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She looks sad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I should talk to this woman in front of me⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line](We⋯mean you no harm⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line](So please⋯put down the weapon⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ I can't attack something when I don't know what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it were a monster, I would have taken it down immediately, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem to be a monster.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Is everything okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know⋯ We'll just have to keep an eye out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a woman with wings on her back⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's listen to what she has to say⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet⋯ Seems like no one is out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Except for us⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's⋯there's hair all over the place⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's really long hair⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't touch that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this lady⋯ Or what is she?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](First of all, is she human?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman with wings⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's no way she's human⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She has wings![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wings?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Look, on the lady's back![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wings⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she a⋯lady?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But something is wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ Something does seems to be wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Kind of cute, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no. Don't touch anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that creature that looks like a lizard⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's a lizard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lizard is an⋯ We'll talk about that stuff later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She really has wings⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Human beings with wings exist⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wings⋯ Sort of like bats.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What's a bat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bat is a⋯ We'll talk about it another time.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Boring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're not trying to have fun right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it gets crazy, then we can run⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's listen to what she has to say⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯ Shouldn't you look around a bit more?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Running away⋯won't solve any problems.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If we run, then they might come running after us.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll make sure that at least Yu-No will be able to escape⋯)[%p]
