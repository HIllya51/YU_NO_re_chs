[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it just goes on and on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how big it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's way bigger than a hundred feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it might even be a thousand feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's far. I wonder how far away it goes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it man-made⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a high wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's gotta be what they call a precipice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a huge lake. I wonder how far it goes from here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How far is it to the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe 30 feet? No, it's gotta be more than 300 feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shore on the other side is really far away⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so spacious out here that I'm losing depth perception.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get a hang of the sense of distance here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When did I even get so far down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Precipice is definitely the right word to describe that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sheer, jagged cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really high up, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling is waaaay up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I heard a voice just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
⋯kuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are my eyes playing tricks on me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's someone over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, they're running across the lake.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]⋯kuyaaa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's no illusion. It's a person, and they're running toward me![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, is that Mio?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey Mio!!![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! It's really you, Mio![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hang on⋯ She's running across the surface of the lake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must've become some enlightened water-walking master or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the lake is really shallow. I'm an idiot.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, if you run so frantically like that⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya⋯ Aah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I warned you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aww, she really took a spill there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Thank you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a pretty funny entrance. Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah⋯my butt is a bit cold though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll rub it till it gets nice and warm.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why so quiet all of a sudden? I'm just kidding.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It really is you, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What makes you say that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Because only you would say something that distasteful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I really thought it was all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All over? What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Say something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, well, now that we've finally been reunited, how about a kiss?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm gonna kick you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Looks like you're feeling better.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll forgive you this time. I'm really happy, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know, I had a feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I just knew that you would come.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's great, now you can open up shop as a fortune-teller.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Thank you very much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me ask the new fortune-teller a question. Will we be saved?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great⋯ Well then, I guess it must be true.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. Somehow, that makes me feel better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's get out of the water for now. Come on.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-Thanks. You're such a gentleman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to be a gentleman to offer you my hand.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, my underwear is soaked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that grin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Nothing. *cough* The weather is so nice today, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're so weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you tell me what happened?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. I have a lot I want to ask you, too. It's give and take.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's so much I want to ask.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We should have plenty of time left⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yet, still⋯)
[name]Mio[line]That's incredible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah. Did you make it all the way through there without Professor Imagawa's notes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her notes? I see⋯ So you were the one who ripped out that page.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know anything about a notebook.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There was an explanation on how to get out written in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would've been handy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯ I can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You solved the mystery of the symbols?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just kind of messed around with them and the lid came off. That's how I found the stairs.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You've got to be kidding me. It's statistically impossible to do that without applying some kind of logical method to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, who cares? I made it here, didn't I?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Whew⋯ I always knew you were amazing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Amazingly weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Mio[line]I mean, you had Professor Imagawa's notes, didn't you? It took her days to figure that out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just got lucky. Anyway, tell me your side of the story.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I have the right to know. I came all the way here, after all.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*lick*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't taste very salty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be seawater. Must be pure groundwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it⋯water?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really cold. Just touching it hurts my hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can it be this cold without freezing though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I get it. Impure particles in it must have lowered the freezing point of the water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like it's actually below 32 degrees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a light coming from the lake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's definitely a light shining there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cold, pale blue light on the surface⋯no, under the surface of the lake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could be glimmering like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this a lake?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge puddle⋯ Maybe lake would be a better word for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's how big this puddle is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never imagined finding a lake like this so far underground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what is this light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light from the lake seems to be making the ground shine, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How far is it to the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]300 feet⋯600⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light from the lake seems to be making the ground shine, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it looks that way because the ground is wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is shining⋯wait, maybe it's not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this pale blue light⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling is dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Saved the pattern from the lid in [AREA-3].[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I take a look at it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's time to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like now isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
