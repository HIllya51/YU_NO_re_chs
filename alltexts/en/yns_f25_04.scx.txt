[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko, but what is she wearing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, you are⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Get down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Owowow! Quit pressing my face against the table.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Shh! This is bad. They're about to leave. I won't let them get away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯ Hey, Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry, I'll explain later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The person I've been waiting for has arrived.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She noticed someone, so she left. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is⋯not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I lost her. What the heck is going on here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she ran off in pursuit of someone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I lost them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you go running off for? I thought you had to go number two.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't have any room for my usual jokes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks pretty upset about whatever's going on⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've let the clue get away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The clue?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My schedule's been cleared once again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh yes, there's something for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]From that Hatano girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hatano? Kanna has something for me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah. There was something addressed to you. I completely forgot until now. I may not look it, but I'm very busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something addressed to me? What is it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's in a rather large manila envelope. It was sealed, so I didn't see what was inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What will you do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I'll take it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. I'm not saying this because my plans suddenly opened up⋯but can you come with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey. Should a teacher really be bringing a student to a hotel?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't be stupid. We're going to the school infirmary, where I work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aww, really?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Knowing that you can still joke around tells me you're fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you were worried about me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Not worried, just curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna has something for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]They say the person you await will never arrive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, some guy stood you up?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't tease me. What are you doing here, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm, uhh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong? Your face is covered with wrinkles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You didn't have to mention the wrinkles⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, now that my schedule has opened up, you can have some of my time, I suppose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you want to talk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯ It's about Kanna Hatano.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The school has already accepted her letter of withdrawal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I heard.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That wasn't the deal. We sealed it with a kiss, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off. Listen, Kanna and I⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmph, how much can I tell her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her one thing, I'll have to explain everything⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here, dressed like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is it weird⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, but I heard this kind of outfit is pretty popular.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the problem.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then what is the problem?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is I don't know why you're here, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, well, it's a long story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like you're out on the town.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, actually⋯when night comes, I want a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, that's a good enough reason. So every night I walk the streets hunting for men. Satisfied?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Normally I'd just believe you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You suspect me for no reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so elusive.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Umm, who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I never would've thought⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is there something on my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, uh⋯ You look way different.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My hair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]People change a lot depending on whether or not their eyes are hidden by their hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, that's not what I mean⋯well, kinda, I guess.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I tell her she looks pretty, it'll go straight to her head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know Ms. Eriko was this pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is beating faster⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair always covered her face⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's smiling at me, but she looks insincere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've seen this face before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But, Ms. Eriko's cigarette⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sometimes I wonder if she's always puffing the same cigarette.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry to bother you with my smoking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I don't care.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Still don't care?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko, I knew it.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, I can't believe this is how you knew it was me. That was a pretty big blind spot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I think of Ms. Eriko, I think of cigarettes. It's like a conditioned reflex now.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm. I guess that's a subject for later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A subject?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A nice body with a cigarette in hand⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cigarettes⋯ Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Eep![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cigarettes make me think of smoke. Smoke flows in the air like a jellyfish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Jellyfish live in the ocean. The ocean is blue. So is the sky. Clouds are in the sky. Clouds are white.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A physician's coat is white. Speaking of physicians⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What the heck?! Where did you get that kind of logic?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh!!![%p]
[name]Woman[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯ Is that you?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]M-My name isn't Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sound like Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I said I'm not Eriko⋯*mumble mumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you mumbling about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wild night life of the school physician⋯ That would make quite a headline.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, here's the thing, I guess that's okay, yeah. How's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm saying this is just between us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're ordering me to silence?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Consider our relationship. After all, they say if you're going to feed someone poison, you should at least serve it on the table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never heard that before⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think that's someone's trademark⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Wh-What do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? I've seen that cigarette before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bangs aren't in the way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks totally different.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always keep it down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look totally different just by putting your bangs up a little.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That was my intention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her intention?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That flowing hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair reminds me of someone⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, Ms. Eriko will make fun of me again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Alas, it's the sad nature of men to still be interested⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're always the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I uh, I was just thinking those clothes are a nice color.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Thank you, hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. She sees right through me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen protuberances like that before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a joke.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how many inches⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a secret.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey⋯ You're too obvious with your face so close to my chest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I am short-sighted.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, it's your fault for dressing like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like you're telling me to look. Geez, do you enjoy stimulating the uncontrollable libido of men?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't remember telling you not to look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? So it's okay if I look?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]On second thought, it's not okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I'm so close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk about a dangerous situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I dare say, I love a dangerous situation.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't resist that rack⋯ Stop it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe this caf⑮. The cup is stuck to the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I can't see that part of you, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrrn⋯ Ugghh⋯ Agghh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, this cup is in my way. Hrrn, grr, ahh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh! I can't get it off.[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Yeah, it's stuck there with glue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's ridiculous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Out of my way, nuisance![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waitress, take this cup away![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*burp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmmm⋯ This is a little rough.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing should be⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp gulp gulp* Gah![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's my coffee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waitress, take this cup away![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]My coffee⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No good. If I stare here, maybe the coffee will⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But my instincts tell me⋯*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's with the wide-eyed stare?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just wondering when the coffee's gonna get here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe if I look here, they'll bring the coffee.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm. I should stop looking too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, this time⋯)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]I brought your refill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What is wrong with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm angry because she's getting in the way of my manly needs.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, dang it. Guess I'll keep on trying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, that shadow tickles a man's curiosity⋯)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]I brought your refill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeey![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]A-Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grr⋯ Gimme a break!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hrm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That dangerous shadow tickles a man's curiosity.)[%p]
[name]Waitress[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you yelling about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm kinda happy⋯but this isn't the time to be looking there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crossing her legs under a glass table⋯that makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's crossing her legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crossing her legs under a glass table⋯that makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The question is what's Ms. Eriko doing here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her dress and behavior are so nice⋯and young.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ I feel like I've seen her before⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But where⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sugar and salt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put a bunch of sugar in my mouth, and then slowly add salt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What'll happen then?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you like one?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can't do anything with the whole bottle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's sugar and salt.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course, I don't need them now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are a bunch of butts in the ashtray.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Judging by the cigarette butts, you've been here for a few hours.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I smoke three at a time, so you can't make that assumption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you⋯put three in your mouth at once?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An ashtray.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A woman with a nice body and an ashtray. That reminds me of something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I'd like to give some money to whoever invented this table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They really understood a man's mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you pressing your face against the table?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I thought it looked a little dirty.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gulp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it okay for it to be so see-through?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course it is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see Ryuuzouji and Kaori on the other side of the shrub.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko was watching them⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji and that lady Kaori are sitting down on the other side of the shrub.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like Ms. Eriko was watching them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shrubs. They're foliage plants.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji and Kaori are on the other side.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those earrings are pretty gaudy, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Some bling, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, I remember seeing this personality somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is really standing out in this caf⑮.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez, she looks so gaudy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're standing out in this caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's weird. I thought this outfit was the least noticeable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who told you that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You said skin-tight dresses and miniskirts were what all Japanese women should wear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't tell if she's serious or not⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm inside the Evening Caf⑮.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
