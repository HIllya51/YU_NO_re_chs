[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What are you doing? Just because it's hot today doesn't mean you have to go swimming⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯not a swim. This is a⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Bath?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh, what was I so nervous about until now, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm going to freeze if I stay soaking like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me what kind of nuts I like.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Umm⋯ You like Red Radia nuts. Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wrong answer, Miss Red Cheeks.[%p]
*bonk*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Ah! Oh Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Okay, let's pick them together and bring 'em to your mother. That'll make her happy.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yup![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey now, don't go too far.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I know! I'll come back with a lot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on! Shaking the tree isn't going to work. It's faster to use your hands.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No is picking nuts over there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I always tell you? Never go outside alone.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area is called the Border. It's dangerous and you shouldn't be out here.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the forest surrounding the cliff has some creepy things lurking around.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I've never seen anything dangerous before![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've just been lucky. I told you, your mom almost died, remember?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I've never seen even one, I know. Anything else you need to say?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]All right⋯ I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh. Well, why did you come out here?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I came to pick some nuts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's still a lot in the kitchen, aren't there?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Not the ones I'm looking for⋯ I came for the ones you like⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's almost your birthday, right? So I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm sorry⋯ I really am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. Let's pick some nuts together.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've apologized already, right?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then we're good.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Awwww, I love you, Dad! Let me join you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I thought you were angry when you were looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't angry⋯ I was just worried about you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes, you were mad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I wasn't.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]See! You look angry right now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not ang– hahaha.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, your cheeks are trembling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And whose fault is that?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You're angryyyy![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm noooooooot.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You never take a bath with me anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]How do you say it? Umm⋯ The love's grown cold between us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did you learn to say that?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]So, I'll just have to take off my clothes and get in the water with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, no no no no. You can't just start taking off your clothes outside.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Why? Don't you take off your clothes when you get in the bathtub?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I do.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]See.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I'm saying![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, if you get your clothes dirty, your mother won't be so happy.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]She'll be pleased to know I'm having fun![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well yes⋯but no. That's not the point here.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Then what is the point?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The point is⋯ Uh, what were we talking about?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]How your love has grown cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What is it? Why are you looking around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, no one else is here but the two of us, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Yu-No is sitting on the riverbank and looking at me, that means I'm inside the river.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Current situation confirmed.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, you fell into the river all of a sudden⋯ You scared me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And whose fault is that, I wonder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yup, that's my daughter. Duh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's grown up so quickly⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been such a short amount of time now⋯ Come to think of it, I wonder if she is going to become old pretty soon at the rate she grows.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What? Do you want to take a bath with me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, is there something on my face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, there is. Eyes, mouth, and wow, you even have a nose there.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You have one, too![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]We're the same![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems so.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]*giggles*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shiny, blonde hair⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must have taken more from Celes' side of the family.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, you also have some curly hair, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch⋯ That hurts. Please don't pull it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*bonk bonk*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]*gasp* What it is, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, just wondering how it's so curly.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I was born with curly hair. Mom takes care of it for me, though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop it, come on.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking at her breasts.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is stupid⋯ I'm gonna stop right here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me tell you something. I was just checking to see how my daughter was⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, you've been talking to yourself a lot recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, well⋯ You've grown.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯your clothing is starting to look stretched.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm very tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hug![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just gave you a hug, internally.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You know I'm right here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]When you love someone, you want to hug them, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Public displays of affection are not preferred.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Public⋯? There's no one here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not about the crowd. It's about what goes on inside of you.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Is it something embarrassing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]So, that means you are always doing something embarrassing to Mom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Wh-What⋯ What are you talking about?![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Every time you go out to get some food, you always give Mom a hug and a kiss, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha-Hahahaha⋯ Oh yes⋯ I thought you meant⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Meant what? What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look very curious now.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Tell me, tell me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Gosh, Yu-No's maturing so fast these days⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her own bedroom, separate from ours, but we better stay wary of her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We're only separated by a thin wall⋯ We should avoid doing careless things too loudly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, what do I mean by careless things?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Playing cards, of course.)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Aww! I love you too, Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't tell you how flattered and embarrassed you make me feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on⋯ Let's do something else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I hugging a rock⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]But Dad, you seem to be giving it a 「proper」 hug, like you know what you're doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to. Just because.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I don't understand⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hug![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Let me join you! Hug![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make a fool out of yourself.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, don't you know that children learn from watching their parents?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she being so logical⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm already in the river⋯ It's cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ What am I supposed to do under the water? Look for some crabs?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Let me join you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you to stop.[%p]
