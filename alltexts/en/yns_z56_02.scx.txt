[name]Takuya[line]I'm almost to the sacred temple⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And after that⋯ The Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desert really is quiet.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I wonder how far it goes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until the Imperial Capital⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The desert goes on forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I think that the Imperial Capital is close, it makes me feel a little better.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're pretty tough, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're pretty tough yourself to keep up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Especially after last night⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]H-Hey! Just forget about it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were cute last night, ya know?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wh-What are you talking about?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is she so upset?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what happens.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You talk to yourself a lot, don't you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you look at the sky too long, your eyes will burn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blue sky and the white clouds⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]There aren't any clouds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a saying.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Okay, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not quite a heat haze⋯but the horizon looks blurry.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That's how tremendous the heat is around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ I can see something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That⋯can't be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is it⋯ What Yu-No and I saw before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯what could it be?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]A sarcophagus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sarcophagus⋯ Is this what they were making in that mine?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah⋯ It's made from the materials they excavate. This is a cemetery for sarcophagi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sarcophagus⋯cemetery? That's a strange way to say things.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This is the result of the God-Monarch's evil ways.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It means that all of these sarcophagi hold dead priestesses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]These are necessary for the ritual. When the ceremony is over, they are disposed of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All these coffins⋯ All priestesses.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Celes would have been in one of these, too?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What do you plan to do? If you continue on, bad things will happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I don't keep going, I can't move forward.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Which means you're going to the temple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my only choice.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It will take another half-day to reach the temple. It would be faster to go straight to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm visiting the temple.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you don't like it, then this is where we part.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm⋯coming with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just have to keep going now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel drawn towards it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temple where I parted with Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just have to go there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Half a day to the temple.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temple⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks the exact same as before⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Be careful⋯ This is the temple where you were captured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I was just remembering.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm being drawn towards it⋯ What is this feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like⋯we're heading towards the temple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view is almost the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We've been walking for a while, but the view hasn't changed at all.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Timewise, it shouldn't take more than a day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One day⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]If we continue straight like this, we will reach the Imperial Capital. At least, we should⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But we have to pass by the sacred temple before that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That's true⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Must you really go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All right. I won't stop you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But be careful. Remember that you were captured near that temple.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right⋯ Yu-No and I were captured at that temple.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No⋯ Where are you? Are you okay?)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't give me a headache⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hey, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I lost control of myself for a minute.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're a strange one⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just remembered you last night, Amanda, and I wanted to go back to that.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You⋯ Just what does 'last night' and 『want to go back』 have to do with each other?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You're giving me a headache.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeeeeey.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't walk behind me like that⋯ Geez.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you sulking like that?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the road to the temple?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes⋯ This is the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is she angry about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ Amanda.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you planning to do now?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I didn't expect you to ask me that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? I know you're not planning on sticking with me forever.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just wondering⋯ What are your plans, Amanda?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]For now⋯ I plan to stay with you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's your goal?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]My goal⋯is to stay with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's stupid.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Shut up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine, but⋯ Don't you have something else you want to do?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]This is what I want to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen to me. What about the resistance?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Watching what you do is part of my work for the resistance, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You expect too much of me, Amanda.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I sure do.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Well, what do you plan to do once you reach the Imperial Capital, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You plan on doing 「something,」 don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Will I be in your way if I come along?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, you won't. But this can't go on forever⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Tsk. I suppose all men are like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? Men are all the same⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm talking about the road to the temple![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is the matter with you?[%p]
