[name]Takuya[line]It's a forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was Celes here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of which, this is where I woke up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a forest⋯ I can't help but sigh in appreciation of its beauty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An awful lot of trees here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's sunlight shining through the leaves⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see fish⋯or anything else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Clear, flowing water⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That tree looks funny⋯ It's bent sideways.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Trees everywhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The leaves are rustling in the wind⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shade makes it cooler down here than up in the hills.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should reach that cliff if I keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This path should take me to that cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't think I'll find Celes there, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll try going back up the hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That way leads to the cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ Might as well go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sign of Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, this is the forest where I first met Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she was up to in the woods.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
