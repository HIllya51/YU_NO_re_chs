[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give it a read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
To my dearest son⋯[%e]
If you're reading this letter, then you're probably grieving after hearing of my death.[%p]
What, you're jumping with joy?[%p]
Anyway, if you're reading this letter, then I'm sure you have the Reflector.[%p]
I must embark on a journey to face the fate that I've imposed on myself.[%e]
There are things I must tell you. Know that in time, you shall follow after me. That is the fate imposed on you.[%p]
Don't look so shocked. I know what you're thinking.[%p]
Let me tell you something. When you were little, I used to lecture you all about history. You would cry the instant you heard my voice.[%p]
As I write this letter, I imagine seeing your face in tears.[%e]
I was still enrolled at the university when I first visited Sakaimachi. I was finishing up my doctorate in history.[%p]
I was researching the Celestials, determined to prove my own theory at any cost.[%p]
You wonder why I was so desperate? [linebreak]It was due to the problems occurring at the university.[%p]
As you know, academic institutions are hotbeds of authoritarianism, where the teacher's will is absolute, and the students must obey to succeed. The Confucian mindset that a student can never question a teacher's theory was alive and rampant back then.[%e]
At the time, I criticized and completely objected to the theory of one of my professors, and put forth my own theory instead.[%p]
And because I was getting my history doctorate for that theory, the consequences of my actions were unavoidable.[%p]
I was so young⋯ I couldn't hold back my enthusiasm. [linebreak]But I ask you this: How can we hope to move forward without questioning existing theories? I can't call what is black, white. That's what I said to my professor before I left the university.[%e]
My misfortune only grew, for my professor was quite powerful in academia.[%p]
I quickly became a wanderer. When I think of it now, that time may have been the most fulfilling time of my life. Around that time, [linebreak]there was a man who came to me.[%p]
A man named Ryuuzouji.[%e]
He was working as a professor at Sakaimachi Academy, which was managed and run by his father. He was a researcher who devoted himself to history, just like myself.[%p]
He said he read my thesis and was impressed by my findings. He called my theory about the 400 year cycle innovative. That the grounds for the argument were sound. He said if it could be proven, it would be a huge sensation.[%p]
He asked if I would like to continue my research at the academy.[%e]
At the time, Ryuuzouji's now deceased father was still the headmaster of Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
It was a poor research facility for a university, but at the time all I needed was a desk for writing and my own brain cells. It was the ideal place for my work.[%p]
I realized this later, but it seems that Ryuuzouji's father was from a completely different school of thought than my old professor. That may be why I was hired to work at the academy.[%e]
Or perhaps he wanted to use my theory to discredit his rival, my old professor.[%p]
Regardless, my research finally began. I had only one goal: to find the origin of the Celestials. I knew the key was here in Sakaimachi.[%e]
Sakaimachi⋯[%p]
Don't you think that's a strange name? 「Sakai」 means a border between two things.[%e]
And the Sword Cape⋯[%p]
It's known as 「Triangle Mountain.」 A mountain of rocks most people think is a natural phenomenon, an earthly monument.[%p]
There is something here in Sakaimachi. Something to do with my theory, 「The Rise and Fall of the 400 Year Cycle.」 And it involved the Celestials, I was sure of it.[%p]
Did these people even exist? There was no evidence. It was merely my theory. In a way, they were imaginary people.[%e]
Still, by assuming these people existed we could explain, to a certain extent, things that had previously been a mystery.[%p]
A theory without evidence is merely speculation. However, you can form a hypothesis based on speculation. [linebreak]And you can build another hypothesis from there. [linebreak]Thus it's possible that original hypothesis could result in real proof.[%e]
If I had stopped to think, I would have undoubtably tossed out that line of thought; I had to run with it, relying on my own will and rebellion against authority.[%p]
It was then I was shown an old piece of art at Ryuuzouji's house. It looked like a painted carpet hanging on the wall. Apparently it's called a tapestry.[%p]
When I was shown that at Ryuuzouji's home, I became the very picture of delight.[%e]
I understood right away that the tower represented Sword Cape. And then my hypothesis–the hypothesis that is so close to revealing the truth in my mind–made the gears in my head turn at an incredible speed.[%p]
If that tower represented Sword Cape, then what did this tapestry mean? [linebreak]It's possible that Sword Cape could make people suffer, but how does a tower cause suffering?[%e]
I investigated Sword Cape exhaustively. I walked around it, bending down like a farmer in field, checking each rock, striving to understand the mountain.[%p]
Triangle Mountain is in fact an eroded part of a tower. Idiotic academics declared it a natural phenomenon without investigating it, believing that the inscription carved into it was done by ancient people out of some kind of religious fanaticism.[%p]
And many people supported that idea.[%e]
If you think a little logically, the contradictions in this theory speak for themselves, but the masses detest any idea detached from their perceived reality.[%p]
The theory that didn't destroy their sense of identity was reality to them; there was no need for logic.[%p]
They had to support their theory to prevent the destruction of their sense of identity.[%e]
It was around then that I found out that I wasn't the only researcher paying attention to Sword Cape.[%p]
Her name was Yurika Imagawa, a research assistant at a university called ACU. She was young, still in her twenties.[%p]
As an expert in theoretical and applied physics, the fact that Sakaimachi's magnetic and gravitation fields were so different from the surrounding area piqued her interest.[%e]
Professor Imagawa was interested in the past and history of Sword Cape. But history wasn't her specialty. Just when she was getting stumped, I appeared.[%p]
She wasn't well studied in the field of history; she hadn't even read the thesis I published.[%p]
Was this fate?[%p]
We got along right away. We presented our research papers to each other and had lively discussions.[%e]
I shared all of my research with her, and she did the same for me.[%p]
My eyes were drawn to a certain woman in her research. Who was she? [linebreak]Professor Imagawa said that there was, apparently, a woman who had been living alone in a house near Sword Cape for a long time. The locals say that she has been living there longer than anyone could remember.[%e]
Curiosity got the better of me. Longer than anyone⋯ That got my historian's blood up. I went to meet that woman.[%p]
What I saw completely surprised me.[%p]
When I saw that young woman, with her hair shining golden and her skin pale and translucent, I completely forgot myself.[%e]
Maybe she was the daughter of whoever had lived here for a long time? I introduced myself, but she only smiled slightly without looking at me.[%p]
She appeared to be blind. She couldn't see me.[%p]
I asked the woman for her name. And she told me in unsteady words. She said it was 「Kaytia.」[%p]
I'll skip ahead here. I'm sure you don't want to hear about our love story.[%e]
Kaytia wasn't on any family registry. I didn't ask her why. Reason is unnecessary in the face of love⋯ Hey, don't get so angry. I can read your emotions.[%p]
With that in mind, I gave her the name Keiko and made her part of my family by marrying her.[%p]
What, you don't care about any of that? Don't say that. This is where the story begins⋯[%e]
Kaytia was a mysterious woman.[%p]
Even though she was blind, you would never be able to tell. She seemed to sense where everything was located. I felt there was something miraculous in her. As an academic I shouldn't say that, but I was surprised to find that, for some reason, I truly believed it.[%p]
Eventually, a child was born, the fruit of our love. It was you.[%e]
It was only then that Keiko told me everything: about how she grew up, where she was from, and why she had to stay in Sakaimachi.[%p]
Surprise, terror, joy⋯ All those emotions ran through my mind.[%p]
Not only did it support the existence of the theory I was researching, it was an even greater truth.[%e]
Keiko⋯ She was a descendant of the phantom people that I call the Celestials. [linebreak]No, I couldn't hit the mark of truth with my words alone.[%p]
I was shaking.[%p]
You are not an academic, Takuya, so I'm sure you wouldn't understand the feeling. [linebreak]We academics seek truth above all else. Objective truth.[%e]
Professor Imagawa was a physicist herself, so she said she wanted to explain the universe with a unified theory based on quantum mechanics. That was her priority in searching for the truth.[%p]
I wonder what I sought⋯[%p]
Proof for the existence of the phantom people?[%p]
No. I listened to Keiko's words and knew my destiny. I was meant to seek out the essence of history. By that I mean it was my supreme destiny to discover the origin of our existence.[%e]
The reasoning has become difficult over time, but even someone with a fly-sized brain like you should be able to understand. You don't need to be convinced. As long as you understand it as it stands, it's fine.[%p]
Before I give an account of her past and her home, I must tell you why Keiko needed to reside permanently in Sakaimachi.[%p]
It was because of a certain rare metal that sleeps in the ground here in Sakaimachi. I named this ore 「Hypersense Stone.」[%e]
Hypersense Stone is a strange mineral. It responds sympathetically to our consciousness. Keiko called it the flame of life.[%p]
Without it, she would die. Unfortunately, a foreign-affiliated geological company called Geo Technics had set their eyes on this rare metal.[%p]
That fact worried me. It became apparent that if the Hypersense Stone touched the open air for even a short amount of time, or if it touched water, more than ninety percent of its components would change.[%e]
The Hypersense Stone that sleeps beneath Sakaimachi⋯ Understanding this rare metal could possibly bring me closer to my goal.[%p]
But then, Keiko died⋯[%p]
I told you that Keiko died of an illness, but it wasn't sickness that killed her.[%p]
She killed herself. Right in front of me. She stabbed herself in the throat with a knife. Don't cover your ears! Keiko took her own life with her own hands.[%e]
Before she died, she spoke to me, saying⋯[%p]
I am not myself. And for the next me to appear, I must leave⋯ Goodbye.[%p]
I still don't know what it was that pushed Keiko that far.[%p]
I know it's ridiculous that her own husband is saying this. I still curse myself. I curse my own incompetence for not being able to save her.[%e]
The only things she left behind were you and a single device.[%p]
The Reflector.[%p]
That is the name Professor Imagawa gave it. It was the only clue of her people that Keiko had brought from her homeland. This device, which seems to be powered by ten Hypersense Stone Jewels, apparently has the ability to cross dimensions.[%p]
What does it mean to cross dimensions? I still haven't come up with an effective answer to this question.[%e]
Professor Imagawa proposed many theories, perplexing and fascinating, attempting to explain functions beyond human understanding.[%p]
But there were only four Jewels embedded in the Reflector. Apparently the remaining six were lost when Keiko came to our side. It seems that when all ten Jewels are embedded, their energy will harmonize and unlock the functions of the Reflector. Even I don't know the details of how that works.[%e]
I asked Ayumi to excavate more Hypersense Stones in an attempt to replace the Jewels. But I know it's nearly impossible with our current technology⋯[%p]
(The letter is torn here. [linebreak]I feel like there something's missing⋯)[%e]
Find all 10 Jewels. Then bring the Reflector to Sword Cape.[%p]
(Oh⋯ If I put this in the torn space of my father's letter⋯)[%p]
(Huh? I don't have the letter⋯[linebreak]Oh well⋯ I'll have to remember what it said and see if it fits.)[%e]
(Oh⋯ If I put my father's letter in this torn space⋯)[%e]
If you have as brilliant a mind as I do, then you know that one day, I would finally unravel the complicated threads of history.[%p]
And that means a new end and new beginning for all of mankind.[%p]
But what is the true definition of history? Have you ever considered that, Takuya?[%e]
I once thought history was a record of the changes that occur as the past moves to the present.[%p]
I thought that its purpose was to record the shape of those changes and fluidity of human society⋯ At least, that's what I thought until then. [linebreak]Historians like us believed that was the true purpose of history, and that the time we dedicated to it was well spent. And so we continued researching, wasting every day.[%e]
Let's assume something here. What if the path from the past to the present wasn't a one-way road?[%p]
Then what is history? The record of mankind's progress? No, that's nothing more than a record of events that happened at specific times. That is not history.[%p]
The flow of time is not an irreversible phenomenon. You must understand that it is a reversible concept.[%e]
So does that mean history can repeat itself?[%p]
Not quite. History is an irreversible concept. The difference here is both miniscule and enormous. [linebreak]When I made that discovery, I decided to go to a certain place⋯[%p]
History can't be repeated, but the flow of time is reversible.[%e]
By the time you read this, I'll be long gone. However, that doesn't mean I am dead.[%p]
You should see two items in front of you. One is a mirror and the other is a device with a very specific purpose.[%p]
The mirror is a keepsake left by your mother, Keiko. The strong connection between you and your mother ties you to that place.[%e]
And the other device⋯ The instructions are inside the second drawer from the top.[%p]
Alone, this device can create enough energy to reverse several tens of hours. The main unit is separate. [linebreak]Make sure the ten Jewels are embedded in it and go to the base of Sword Cape tonight at 10pm. Someone will be waiting there for you.[%e]
Hand the device to that person. There you shall understand everything. [linebreak]Do not tell Ayumi about this. Make sure you go alone.[%p]
She must not find out about it. Not yet⋯ But at some point, I'm sure I will tell her about it.[%p]
Let that responsibility rest with me.[%p]
You must be very careful. If there are not 10 Jewels in that device, there is no point.[%e]
If there are not⋯ [linebreak](The letter ends here, but the journal goes on⋯) [linebreak]Find the 10 Jewels. Then bring the Reflector to Sword Cape.[%p]
You must go on the date written below. That is⋯[%p]
(It's tonight.) [linebreak]I definitely want to meet that person tonight at 10 o'clock.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put the letter on the desk for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Collect 10 Jewels, tonight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's already after 10 o'clock. What should I do?[%p]
