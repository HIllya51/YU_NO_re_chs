[name]Yuuki[line]What was it you wanted to talk about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right. I don't want to know about your wig.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's not a wig.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wigs these days can't be told apart from real hair.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But this is my real hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems suspicious to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There's nothing suspicious about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's your trademark: the hairpin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you look like a cue ball under that thing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No I don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanted to ask about where you saw Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Eh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where did you see her today?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where inside the school?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]In the main hall and at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why two places? Does she have a doppelganger or something?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I just saw her twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Twice?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The first time was before I called you, and the second time was when Mrs. Arima, I mean your stepmom, was leaving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She left?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ahh, please don't hit me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I think she said she had to do an inspection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](An inspection?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]This might be nosy, but did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing happened, so you think something happened, huh?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna go look for Ayumi now.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wait, you're not going to remedial class?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay, someone can sit in for me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I can't say I'm surprised you have a suck-up who'd do that for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm talking about you.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have fun in class for me. Now get going![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]B-But⋯ I have my own remedial class⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You only came to school to see Mio, you liar.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I'm really trying to study. Okay, geez. Don't look at me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's going to be in remedial class. She's gonna be in the same classroom, too.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll go. Please let me go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, get going then![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Eeeek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Don't you know about the mysterious international organization trying to take over the world?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I made this up last night. Was it funny?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ahahaha⋯ I think I know your answer just by the look on your face. Well, Masakatsu Yuuki is reporting for sit in duty![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was all for it as soon as I mentioned Mio. What a simple guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I just need to go to where Ayumi is. She said she was doing an inspection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it's an inspection⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You called me this morning, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Th-That's because you wanted a wakeup call. I'll call a little later next time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Not that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What you talked about on the phone. You⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry you didn't like my joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It definitely wasn't some creepy maggot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right. You're the maggot. Listen.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It was a roly poly dumpling like this. Hahaha! I know you'll laugh at that one.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Yuuki[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I want to know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So, what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I mean.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, you don't think she's great?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Yes. She is great.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grr! That's not what I'm talking about![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh? What are you trying to say then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I'm getting more stupid every moment.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm Nice Guy Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be so full of yourself.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Takuya, it is I, Yuuki, your first mate![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the heck are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have your hands in your pockets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means you don't care much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have your hands in your pockets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you carrying something dangerous on you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No need to worry. I'm not holding anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody knows what those fingers are up to.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not doing anything.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's just a hoodie, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's your trademark. Always wearing the same hoodie.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I have a few different ones that are all the same design.[%p]
