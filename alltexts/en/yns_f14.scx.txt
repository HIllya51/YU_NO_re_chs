[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I was trying to reach the hotel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Kanna be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, someone's coming out of the entrance.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Oops, pardon me⋯hm?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hey, what a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh it's you.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't tell me Kanna is with you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm alone.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Glad to hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It seems as though Kanna is always wearing a necklace.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I've come to that conclusion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna is always wearing a necklace?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And he came to that conclusion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was Houjou doing in front of Kanna's apartment building anyways?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's apartment is on the fifth floor at the end of the hall. Apartment 501.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? I'm back at Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't bring the medicine with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm actually pretty surprised Kanna would live in such a dreary place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember she said she didn't have any family⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could she be living here⋯alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever, I should get that fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A drug that works well for fevers. I know where to go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of the apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have her student handbook with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should probably give it back to her as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ This seems like an excuse, but it's the right thing to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That middle-aged man really bothers me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does he know Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That middle-aged man really bothers me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does he know Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a pretty incredible apartment building.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, thank you for walking me all the way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It got late while you waited for me, so it's only right for me to walk you home.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want your parents to be mad or anything.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh, I live by myself, so that's not a problem.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, you live alone? You're kidding, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you for today. Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Well, if it isn't Kanna. So, you finally showed up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Man[line]Long time no see. How ya been?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who's this guy?)[%p]
[name]Man[line]You haven't called at all. I'm glad I waited for you in front of your apartment building.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Good evening⋯ Houjou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Houjou? Does she know this guy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy is way too friendly.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]How about we go out for some tea or something?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry, I'm not feeling very well today.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't say that just after meeting again. Why don't we go out for old time's sake?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm sorry Houjou. I really am tired today.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Just a little while.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]How about I go to your apartment and–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A human.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Kanna, this seems like a bad neighborhood. Let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, old man, she clearly doesn't want to go anywhere with you. Don't talk to Kanna like you're her best friend or something.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, it's fine⋯ I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're the one being too friendly, calling her by her first name like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Passersby should keep their mouths shut.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Who's a passerby?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm looking at one right now.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]*ahem* I'm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her friend's father's second cousin?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]That would make us complete strangers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are strangers.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Ooh⋯ I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]If that's the case, you should have told me sooner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're one of hers too⋯aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Ooh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima isn't like that. He's my classmate.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, a classmate, eh?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I thought Kanna got herself another friend. That's a relief. Now, let's go to a cafe for some tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, old man. Why don't you cut out the perv stuff?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]A young man with a short temper, huh? Hey, don't get violent on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then don't make me get violent.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Meandering around at night⋯you're some kind of punk, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy looks like he's a part of the Yakuza or something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell is his relationship to Kanna?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They don't seem like friends.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's probably old enough to be her father.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old enough⋯to be her father?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you to Kanna?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, we're just friends. With benefits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, you're too old to be her friend.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're very conservative for such a young man. Friendship and love have nothing to do with age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Friendship⋯and love?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hmph, anyway, it's none of your business.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're just a boorish guy who sticks his nose where it doesn't belong, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just saying she doesn't want to go with you.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hmph, I hope that's all. It's pretty obvious you have slimy intentions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please, stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, please⋯stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's okay. I know Houjou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Kanna, let's continue this tomorrow. Will you call me?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. Sorry I made you wait for so long tonight.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It's fine. Take care of yourself.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Try not to stick your nose in other people's business from now on, kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh yeah, Kanna. I'll be drinking downtown for a while. You can come by if you need anything.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you apologizing for?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I thought that whole thing might have made you uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not my first time crossing paths with one of those guys.[%p]
*faint*
[name]Takuya[line]Oh K-Kanna![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm fine⋯ Thank you for catching me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* You don't need help back to your room?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I'm fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you, Arima. Goodbye and⋯goodnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hey, are you coming to school tomorrow?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. I have to speak to my homeroom teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gotcha. Okay, see you tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was that middle-aged man though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am curious⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should've asked Kanna what's up with her and that guy⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gosh, why am I worried about what Yuuki said now, of all times?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I can just talk to her tomorrow at school.[%p]
