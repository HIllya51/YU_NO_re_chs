[name]Takuya[line]I lost her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure Kaori came this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Kaori climbed this utility pole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she didn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Princess Shimazu's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she isn't around there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. She couldn't have gotten that far in such a short time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You think Kaori's a jet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She won't be in the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could I jump into the ocean from here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's interesting, but this isn't the time to mess around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It hasn't been that long since Kaori hurried away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Meiunji Park is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's full of passionate couples at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, those three are really close to each other. Maybe it's a threesome⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's three men. Woah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't see that every day⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go down to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's kinda weird.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Three guys in a park where only couples gather.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And it's that nasty Toyotomi bastard⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is he in the park at this time anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, once I go over this fence, I'll be in the park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I won't be able to rest until I see it with my own eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's definitely Toyotomi. There's no mistaking that stiff suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But who are the other two?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a fat one and a skinny one.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They look like they're bad news.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way to Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I can't leave her, but I'm curious about Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that Houjou bastard might still be there.[%p]
