[color index="880000"]Mayor Shimazu's daughter, Mio Shimazu (18), made a significant statement to this anonymous journalist last night at the coastline.[color index="800000"][%p]
[color index="880000"]According to the confession, the current mayor has a close relationship with Geo Technics and is deeply involved with the corruption of construction and property concessions.[color index="800000"][%p]

[color index="880000"]Now an investigation into the current mayor is inevitable, which makes Mio Shimazu's position a precarious one.[color index="800000"][%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is exactly what Mio said to me last night at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why is it written here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio and I were the only ones around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means, either Mio or I wrote this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio would never write something this stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wrote it?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. There's no way I would write that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is some kind of bad joke. Shit![%p]
*rip*[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, what are you doing? That was a good article and you tore it down![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is what happens to irresponsible gossip articles.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Isn't that against freedom of speech?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have to use your own name and take responsibility for it to be covered by freedom of speech.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Uh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this 「anonymous reporter」 crap? I don't believe anyone who won't take responsibility like that.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I'm just saying, without the convenience of anonymity, the Watergate Scandal would never have been exposed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should teach you that the sword actually is mightier than the pen.[%p]
[name]Student[line]N-No, that's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now go. Get going. Shoo.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]Forget it, he's a walking libido.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Maybe he's got something for Shimazu.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why Mio was like that earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to find Mio and figure this out. I know she'll think I did it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The way things are, I'm the only one that could have done it. Mio and I are the only ones who know about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I wouldn't do something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means it's someone other than Mio or myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, who was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now I have to find Mio and talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, in front of the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That crowd of people isn't normal.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, don't push.[%p]
[name]Student[line]What? You want to know what's up?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Read the bulletin board. There's something interesting written there.[%p]
[name]Student[line]It's exactly what I thought.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But it's crazy that it was his own daughter that confessed.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Huh? What's going on?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Look, it's posted on the bulletin board. Check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said, it's in front of the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you want to know what that crowd of people is about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right in front of the bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that crowd of people?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In front of me. Look, over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on. This isn't the time to use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't that bother you?[%p]
