[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I found the secret papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make Ayumi feel better with this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, do your best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you so nice all of the sudden?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, it's for my benefit, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You seem to know what you want.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I only view things in a practical way. Do you think that's a shameful?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd say it's actually cool.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Tehe. You say the same thing as Dr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Exactly. I interviewed your father once. Did I tell you about this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We got to know each other more personally after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]More personally?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, I don't mean it in a weird way. We'd go out to dinner and just talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]He was a mysterious man. So relaxed, yet he would never let his guard down. And somehow he opened up to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's his trick. As long as it's a woman, he doesn't care.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you really think so? In other words, you can say that he was sincere to everyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't you agree?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about that 20th page I gave you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You don't like me talking about your father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I mean. I'm just making sure we don't get sidetracked.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This is mine now. It's our promise, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't worry. The important fact is that you discovered the document from Arima and Toyotomi's office. Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do with this?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You found it. You can use it, however you like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If anything happens, come to the hotel downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, the hotel⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's where my headquarters is, for now. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I found the secret papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make Ayumi feel better with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where is Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she is working, she should be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if I can go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can hear noises from inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi is inside the company building at this hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I was supposed to meet Yuuki back at⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No luck.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]O-Oh, I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Where would Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place I can think of.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that on purpose?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not in the city. I checked every shop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I will go look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place that Mio would go⋯hmm.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, knock it off with that Boss Man crap.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I just parted with you moments ago.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And it only takes a moment to find someone, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's actually right sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Come on. You're the only person I can rely on, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right⋯ I'll try looking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Thank you, sir.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where he's looking.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I found her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, in the northern sky, the first star.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯ I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought a joke would relax him.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯huff* Did you find her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I haven't had any luck yet.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I am currently investigating every lead I have. If you find something, please come to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please do your best, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said I'm not your Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no way that Mio is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi doesn't seem to be in the company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the guard isn't here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A security card is in my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I have a security card, can't I go inside and reach Ayumi's office?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't have a security card now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey, you there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You came back again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came to see Ayumi⋯ I mean, Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Mrs. Arima? She just came back⋯but she might have to head out again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, today might be her last day at work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her last day?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Because she'll be dismissed from her position.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It could be worse. She might have to face criminal charges.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? Did I mishear what she said?)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're her immediate family, right? I guess it's fine then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You'll know by tonight or tomorrow. They've decided at the board meeting. She is going to take full responsibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Hey! Don't be so rough⋯ Let go of my collar![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What responsibility?![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I don't know⋯ I guess the responsibility for all the accidents?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please explain it to me. Why does Ayumi have to take responsibility?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, it's obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obvious?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yeah. She's the one in charge, right? Isn't it natural for her take responsibility?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]She was given authority and had an obligation to take responsibility for it. It is what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That doesn't mean it's right. So what about the guy who hired Ayumi? Isn't he also responsible?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm not the one you should be trying to convince.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Of course, I feel bad for her too. I don't know her too well, but she was not a bad person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If so⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm just a security guard that they hired. I don't have the right to say anything about the company's decision.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]It's a call. I'm sorry, I have to get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Whoa.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Look, don't come here anymore. In the future, I won't be able to treat you nice, so remember that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why does Ayumi have to take responsibility?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, if I hadn't done that earlier, I could be with Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to see her and talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it's a misunderstanding that can be solved, we can discuss it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then, think about it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi still inside the company building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the guard isn't here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I can't believe she saw me talking to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry, I wasn't looking and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong? You've got a scary look on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, really?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Exactly. You look like a yakuza whose girlfriend cheated on him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait, don't look so serious. It's just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't sound like a joke to me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing. I'm just experiencing self-hatred for my behavior.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm making a delivery. It's from the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Headmaster? You mean⋯ Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah. Mitsuki is Headmaster Ryuuzouji's secretary.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She might have some stuff to do for Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A delivery for Geo Technics? What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, what's wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're not that stubborn anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If so, it's because of you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, thanks. You're good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk⋯ She avoided me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's hard to get here with the uphill slope, but there are some good things as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe⋯ I found a comfortable-looking lawn. How about we talk for a bit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There are things I want to discuss with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's go then. Now, come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't push my back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something that was stuck in my heart feels looser now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it really because of Mitsuki?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's been a long time since I talked to her⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We used to⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oops, let's not think about that now. I have to talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A talk with Mitsuki, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does she want to talk about?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, I see⋯ So that was how it happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So, you cried and ran off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you really have to say it like that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry, but you haven't changed at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're still mama's boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk. I shouldn't have told her.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, your face looks like I nailed the bull's-eye. Seriously, you haven't changed at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is a woman who says what she thinks without holding back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But something that was stuck in my heart feels looser now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't go inside anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, I bet I can't go inside. Even for immediate family members, it's difficult to get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, I've been inside once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was when I delivered papers for Ayumi that she needed for work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She couldn't start the meeting without them, so I delivered them for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I have something related to the company, I should be able to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I have something related to the company? Something like a document that I mentioned earlier?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if there is something like that, I might be able to get inside. But where can I get it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that jerk isn't here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no. It's the guard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Last night, it might have looked like I ran away.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Have you seen Chief Arima by any chance?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]*sigh* I called her house but she's not answering. I wonder what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That's right, I should ask Mr. Toyotomi to contact her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi?)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]*sigh* There was some trouble during the briefing yesterday. A thief broke in shortly after, and there are even more problems today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me, what's going on?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You should leave now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's not answering the phone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She should be sleeping by now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where they held the briefing yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Although, it was more like a protest rally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'm here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I can't get inside like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe that disaster at the briefing happened right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's all cleaned up. It's unbelievably quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So many people.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not just a few people. More than a dozen, at the least.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Come on, the company should give a decent explanation.[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]Yeah, that's right. A reasonable explanation, please![%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]How are you going to apologize to the families left behind?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is more of a protest than a briefing⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those guys are getting agitated.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](People are holding banners and signs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They do look exactly like protesters.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Where is Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apparently, the briefing is going to start here soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is supposed to be leading it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that was a workout, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm this tired, I must be really out of shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess quitting kendo affected me more than I thought.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Eek.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Ahh, my papers⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I wasn't looking.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no⋯oh dear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't go inside anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* This company saps your strength and will.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Can you let me by?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've seen her somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Now, how will I do it today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do it?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, are you going in here too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You don't look like one of my colleagues. Do you work here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not directly involved, but I am invested, I guess.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hmm⋯ Oh, right. Are you with the Citizens' Association?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I heard there will be a briefing from the company this afternoon. Did you come for that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]This company isn't looking so good. If you want to criticize them, you should do it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, but I–[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]You're here again.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're a nuisance. I told you I can't answer any questions.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Well, I'll have to use my talents to get around that.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I don't care if you're some famous newscaster. I was ordered not to let you in. No exceptions.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You're stubborn. Didn't you hear that I'm inviting the head facilitator to the studio tonight?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I heard, but that's different than this.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]The head facilitator will go directly to the studio. Letting you in here is a completely different matter.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, well. I'll get inside eventually.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Sorry, I'm going past you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Nothing I can do about it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Wait, who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯hi.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Have we met?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I see lots of people every day, so I can't remember faces. Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. It's a tough job.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, it's a call. Whew, don't even have time to rest.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]So do you understand, kiddo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kiddo?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I can't let you in here even if you are immediate family. If you need to contact employees inside, call them by using the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone. She seems so busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I get tired just by coming here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I get tired just by coming here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you're⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, I think she is the security guard.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, and what are you doing here, kiddo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, just to let you know, I'm a student.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Not a 「kiddo.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I'm here to see Ayumi⋯ Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, she was just here inside the company building. But who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯ I told you last night. I'm Ayumi's son.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Last night? I'm sorry. I just don't remember you because we have so many people coming and going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, is my stepmother here?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Too bad, she just left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]She came back from the inspection and had a short meeting, but she left again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]We have a briefing today, so the chief seemed busy too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A briefing?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You told me you're the chief's son, but outsiders are prohibited here. Be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh okay. And where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Don't know. She's a busy lady. Oh, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]She said she has something to do at home. I remember that's what she said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, I have something that I have to do, too. I'm going to be stuck inside the company building all day today. Bye now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like we keep missing each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she at home? Okay, let's go back again.[%p]
