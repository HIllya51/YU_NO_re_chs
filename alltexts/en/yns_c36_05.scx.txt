[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. No matter what Kaori's intentions are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I need now is proof of Ayumi's innocence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I can find it in here⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Any luck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Kaori⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh dear, have you found anything at all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Liar. What's that in your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You found the secret documents, didn't you? You were successful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯ Why did I take these?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, these are the documents Ayumi was holding![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can prove Ayumi's innocence with them⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I did what I had to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So, where did you look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The desk, the drawing table, and in the drawers. I looked everywhere except the one drawer I couldn't open.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh come on. It's like you didn't look at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, I did my best to–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Only people who get results should say they did their best. Otherwise, it's just a loser talking nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A boozer talking nonsense?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm not talking about a drunk. I'm talking about a person who fails to get results.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. My point is, why are we wasting time while you preach at me, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I can't help myself. Fine then, let's search together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That man, Toyotomi, is more clever than you'd think. But he's not too clever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, somewhere clever, but not too clever?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, that's where you should look. Can you do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi is clever, but not too clever.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, where?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't I remember something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about 20 pages⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page is missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page⋯ Didn't I see it somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a thin booklet. It's probably around twenty pages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]1, 2, 3, 4⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯18, 19, 21, 22⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page is missing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The 20th page⋯ The 20th page?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe, this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like they're here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you think that's where something important would be hidden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, where is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The documents were in there this afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's stop acting dumb.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Clearly, I'm hitting the table.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Please be serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's not paying attention to the plans on the drawing table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must not be interested in it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough. I just don't feel like looking anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I am interested in the picture on the table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The samurai mansion and Triangle Mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll just hit it once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And here we⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some kind of drawn plans⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain on the left, and on the right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Blueprints of what looks like a samurai mansion⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Ayumi draw this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And where is this samurai mansion supposed to be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This machine is for drawing up plans. It's not a punching bag.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I guess Ayumi won't be using this anymore⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I think about that, I just want to hit it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I do that, I'll break it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like the machine doesn't have anything to do with this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We don't need the terminal at this point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We're searching for something more concrete.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like something's wrong⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]None of these machines are turned on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Usually there's at least a server that stays powered on at all times⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, all of them are turned off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I turn on the machine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's a bad idea to mess with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like the machine doesn't have anything to do with this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We don't need the terminal at this point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We're searching for something more concrete.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like something's wrong⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]None of these machines are turned on⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Usually there's at least a server that stays powered on at all times⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, all of them are turned off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it won't be good if I turn it on, will it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something smells good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time for that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you taking this seriously?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's nice and fragrant⋯but I probably shouldn't be doing this right now.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's Toyotomi's chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pfft, bleh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something smells good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be Ayumi's chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's nice and fragrant⋯but I probably shouldn't be doing this right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Ayumi's area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where else⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's Ayumi's desk. It won't be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the saying? A smart person hides leaves in a forest.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This isn't a forest. Ayumi's under suspicion, right? This is the first place they'd look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess you're right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's the case⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A desk. There's nothing strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi uses this desk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I guess I should say she used to use it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top of the desk is all tidied up. The only things on it now are office automation equipment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's not in the AC unit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The AC. Could it be in here?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's perceptive. But there's no room to hide anything inside that type of AC.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it blows comfortable air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A ceiling AC unit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, AC is short for air conditioner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's in there⋯ No way.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not inside the teapot.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're not taking this seriously, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a joke⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, next⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a teapot. I'm not thirsty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Therefore, there's no need to touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something inside the teapot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, this weekly magazine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it was placed there on purpose.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess not.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Liar. What's that in your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You found the secret documents, didn't you? You were successful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? Oh, that's right, I had it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, I almost forgot.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, these are the documents Ayumi was holding![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can prove Ayumi's innocence with them⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Secret Documents][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Secret Documents][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Here they are, I found the documents Ayumi was holding![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can prove Ayumi's innocence with them⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a weekly magazine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This probably doesn't have anything to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Correct. That's Toyotomi's desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not? You just said I was correct.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Tsk, tsk. You were about to search Toyotomi's desk. I was just confirming that is his desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be so misleading. So it's not there?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Nope. If there was something on his desk that isn't supposed to be there, it'd look super suspicious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's about the extent of his intelligence. He's at least put that much thought into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then where is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay, I'll give you a hint.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't patronize me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm not sure where it is, either. However, I do have a brain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I know it's hidden somewhere in this room. He said it was in 「a safe place.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get it. Since they were taken from the office, you wouldn't think that he hid them somewhere in here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Correct. You're pretty clever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, he must have considered the possibility of someone finding them. If those documents were discovered in this room⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Right, he wouldn't let that kind of discovery lead back to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means they definitely won't be at his desk or in his belongings. In fact, Ayumi's belongings would be searched first⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]They must be somewhere that has nothing to do with either Ayumi or Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, if and when the documents are discovered, there needs to be a reason why.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, you're pretty sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It just looks like a normal desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like they're here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she read magazines over here during her breaks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desk is probably for breaks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a teapot and some other stuff here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chair looks rather uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This chair doesn't look very comfortable.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's because this room is both Ayumi and Toyotomi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The room that Kaori was doing something in, just moments ago⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she had her own plans.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Kaori is doing something over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something I have to do here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's connected to the room Kaori's searching in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is she doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, to each their own. I have my own things to search for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Find anything, Kaori?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Not yet. How about you?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((I know it's here. Search everywhere.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what Kaori's doing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, to each their own. I have my own things to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost pitch black.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the room isn't going to get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at that won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'm the only one in this room.[%p]
