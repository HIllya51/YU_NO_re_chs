[name]Mitsuki[line]What are we going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what we should do⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish I could ask someone for help⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a hard and heavy boulder.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's impossible. There's no way we can move that boulder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This won't work. I can't move it at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what happened to Yuuki. Is he outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Maybe he went to call for help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Waiting here is one option.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And leave Mio all alone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, maybe you can stay and–[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it. I don't want to stay here alone. I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯ Oh well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I really be looking at this rock?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a weathered rock.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you staring at a rock?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. All we can do is move forward.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait, we're going back inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I want to go back a bit.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on. Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
