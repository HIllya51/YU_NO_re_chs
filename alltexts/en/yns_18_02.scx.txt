[name]Toyotomi[line]This is a restricted area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hate everything about this guy, but I can't actually punch him.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mostly because it would be a problem for Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pounding my chest won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Crraaaackkk![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was the point of saying that aloud⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You talk to yourself a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, if I did that⋯it'd be pretty funny.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But the construction is running behind, so the chief's position is extremely precarious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Precarious?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]We do our best to manage all construction and equipment within legal standards, but there have been a lot of accidents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Thanks to that, the local residents are calling for a halt to the construction. It would be bad if they organized a sit-in at the construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean a protest?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Nothing as nice as that. It would be an emotional call to eliminate us. The biggest problem are the families of those who died in the accident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, that's obvious.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't be stupid. We do everything according to legal compliance. I am not responsible for any of this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No one would blame a little underling like you.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, telling you this won't change anything. The chief was here earlier, but now I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where is she now?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I just told you, I don't know. Make sure you don't go near Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi was just here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, porn director Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already told you why I'm here. I'm looking for my stepmother, and I'm asking you where she is.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I see. So you're running around all over the place to ask the poor chief for money. Yes, that makes sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, Mr. Porn Director, where is she?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Dunno.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why are you pounding your own chest?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I just got a lump in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, I don't want to cause Ayumi any problems.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how much of a moron he is, he has the right to live.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen, her mind is currently extremely, ludicrously, troubled.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]When I see her letting that baboon of a boss, who undresses her with his eyes, hold her hand all for the pittance of a paycheck in that brown envelope⋯ Gah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She gets paid way more than you do, and no company hands over money in brown envelopes anymore.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]And then she goes home to a misbehaving son, who's always begging for money. She opens that envelope only with the most reluctance⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]And then, just when she needed him the most, a gallant nice guy appears. And that is⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Not you.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ahem! So, why did you come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy okay?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know Ayumi? My stepmother?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I imagine your mother working nights to make artificial flowers. Much different from the image of Chief Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For your information, Chief Arima is my stepmother.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]But you're not blood related. If you were blood-related, it would send a chill up my spine, but now I feel safe and secure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]All right. Don't worry yourself. I will soothe her mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Soothe? Are you going to cover her with ashes?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're talking about soot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, so it's like a nice outfit.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're talking about a suit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I'm hungry.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're thinking about soup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, well⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Soothe, it's soothe. It is how we heal diseases, wounds, and worries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So who is healing whose worries?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's up with this guy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's pretty annoying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks all stiff like burlap⋯ You're so green.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's designer![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen, this is a $1,200 suit. It would take you about 120 years to buy it on your allowance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For a burlap suit? That's too much.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're wearing some pretty weird clothes for a construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A construction director is usually an old man wearing a white shirt with a bandanna around his neck and a huge beard.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That is a very prejudiced idea of a director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I remember this guy's name is Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's kind of a weird dude.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I ask him about Ayumi?)[%p]
