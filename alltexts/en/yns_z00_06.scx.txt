[name]Takuya[line]This is Illia's bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like we can communicate, so I should ask for more information.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Why are you looking around? Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Illia's bedroom⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yeah, I sleep here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is in bed⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia⋯ A woman with a sword⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is beautiful, but I sense something powerful inside her⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beautiful hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Spread all over the bed⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Flowing hair⋯ It's beautiful.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*laugh* You are the first one to tell me that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. The men here must be blind.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How come she's quiet now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know what to do.)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]My ear⋯ Is there anything wrong with it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have more important things to ask her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, even some of my classmates have pointy ears.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not something that's super rare⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I am curious⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm⋯ Illia, you have pointy ears?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes Takuya, and you have flat ears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, it doesn't mean anything but⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have something more important to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see twin suns. And they look so soft⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You are beyond strange. I cannot fathom you.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Wh-What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sunshine.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, I'm not going outside.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You talk to yourself a lot⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Whew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯ Hmmm⋯ Umm.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What⋯are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯resisting a command.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry. This happens all the time.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really know. My body wants to go outside without my permission.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You are beyond understanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really don't get it, either.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah yes⋯ I have a question for you, Illia.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Didn't you have a question?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Hey⋯what⋯ Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is a proverb saying that 「Even a chance meeting is due to fate,」 so⋯ Yeah, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Somehow, she looks mad⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof⋯ Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding, don't look so serious.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You are beyond understanding.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]By the way, Celes⋯ I don't see her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, come to think of it⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! Celes, are you here?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]She must have gone outside⋯ This is serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? Maybe she went for a walk.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]This place is near the Border⋯ I don't know what kind of creatures may show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Don't scare me⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You should be scared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll be fine. If something's wrong, she'll just scream and run away⋯ Oh shit![%p]
[name]Illia[line]She has no voice, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna go take a look.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You need a sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sword?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Every knight of Dela Grante has a sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm no knight.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Here, take mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your sword? Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Why carry a sword if not to save a life?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I cannot move. This is up to you⋯ Go, quickly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's lighter than it looks⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like a sword that cuts through the wind⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Easy to hold, good for swift movement⋯ Amazing.)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nice sword. I've never held something like this before.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You have a strange stance⋯ This is your first time holding a sword?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First time holding a real sword. I know some kendo, which is an ancient form of Japanese martial arts.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I see⋯ So, there is a country like that outside the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if it's outside, but I was there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yes⋯ I was there⋯)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Now, hurry⋯ It's dangerous for her to be out alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ I'll take your advice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying that Celes is that priestess?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯but if so, that means something is wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How so?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]One must cross the vast Rafaelo to come here from the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rafa⋯ What?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The Rafaelo Desert⋯ You can see it from outside of this house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see⋯ That one out there.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]At an average person's pace, it will take nearly a week to reach the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it that far?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Where do you think this is? This is the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]And, if a priestess is out here at this time of the year, that means she has abandoned the ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceremony?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]There was an earthquake earlier, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That is the rage of mother nature⋯ It is getting stronger every year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It is said that the rampage of mother nature comes every few hundred years. The priestess will appease this with the help of God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Appease the wrath of nature⋯with the help of God.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯ Maybe she is the⋯*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes, thank you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you sure?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is all a part of fate. I will help you if there is something I can do.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*laugh* Thank you⋯ But God shall call upon me soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Don't joke around.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't shake this strange feeling when you say that.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Right. I feel the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you seen Celes before?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]No⋯ But I've seen that style of attire somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her clothes? You've seen them before?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did you see it?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]At the temple of the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The temple?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I remember the priestess there wore the same clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean by priestess?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]A sacred position passed down for generations. They are the medium through which God shall descend and reign over us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God⋯shall descend through a priestess?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯ I do not know the process itself, but it is the utmost important ritual in the land. It is vital that God descends upon us through the priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]She cannot speak, which supports my theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What connection is there between her not talking and being the priestess?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]A priestess is given various mystical abilities⋯ However, the holy power is only gained by sacrificing a part of her body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Only once every few hundred years, God will descend⋯ The priestess will let God take over her physical body in order to cleanse the world through the sacred ritual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God⋯descending? No way.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]To believe or not to believe, it is your choice. Is there no God outside the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]When I was still in the Imperial Capital, I heard about the priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you think that's Celes?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I am not sure. The current priestess is said to have lost her own words in exchange for receiving the message of God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Lost her own words⋯)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]By the way, where is she from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The woman you were with.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes, Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We met in the woods near here.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]In the woods?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she was lost⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Strange, there are no houses around here, and the city is far away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh? That means⋯you're all alone out here?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes. People are prohibited from entering or leaving the vicinity of the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was hoping you might have an answer.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]She⋯cannot speak?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I guess not.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why⋯ Do you know something?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]No⋯ I'm just imagining things. This⋯can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Never mind. It's your turn now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mine?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Who are you and how did you get here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You are not from Dela Grante, are you? Your clothes and everything you say is strange. Different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ It's my first time hearing about Dela Grante. I don't live here. At least, I hope not.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Did you come from beyond the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. I woke up and I was in the woods.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You might not believe me, but it's true. Well, I don't even believe myself, so I won't blame you.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Did you lose all of your memory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. The world I came from–if I can call it that–I still vividly remember that place.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I'd like to hear it, for my own knowledge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You probably won't understand.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I want to hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You asked for it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, Illia is calm and intelligent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The things I'm telling her won't affect us either way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's try talking⋯ Maybe I can get some clues.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was exploring the underground maze of a place called Triangle Mountain. I fainted, and when I came to, I was in the forest.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯are you sleeping?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I am listening. I was thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]To be honest, it's like hearing a fairytale⋯ It really is hard to believe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, right? Even I can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I understand from your story that you are not from what lies outside the Border⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what it means to be outside the Border, but I am definitely not from Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You seem to come from a completely different world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess so.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Honestly, I am confused.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't ask you to believe me. But, will you accept the fact that I do exist?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes, I will. You exist here now⋯ There's no denying it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, just to confirm, you don't happen to know how I can get home, do you?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I am sorry to say that I have no clue whatsoever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I knew it, but it still upsets me to hear that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said it so definitively⋯)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Anything else you would like to ask?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, actually, I have so much more.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What is the matter? Is there something you wish to ask me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, that's right⋯ I wanted to ask you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thirty-three inches.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What are 「inches」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long is a Leitel?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Well⋯we are about 30 Leitels away from each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's about 3 feet between her and I, that means a Leitel is about 1/10 of a foot⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So then 28 Leitels in inches are⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hehe.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Suddenly laughing out loud, you really are a strange person.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]My chest is 28 Leitels⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]28⋯what?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]28 Leitels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that word, 「Leitel?」[%p]
[name]Illia[line]A unit that expresses the length as a numerical value⋯ How can you not know about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never heard of it.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That's right, you are a moron after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, I want to know the size of your chest, around your navel and the numerical size of your hips.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What will you do with that information?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will laugh and it will make me happy.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I still do not understand you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I wanted to ask you are your sizes, Illia.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Sizes? What do you mean by sizes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me ask you in another way.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]This place is known as Dela Grante⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela⋯ Grante⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, let's back it up a little more⋯ Illia, where is your house located?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Where is my house⋯located?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For the sake of saving time, I know the house is built on the ground, I know the ground is made of soil.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*pfft*⋯ Hahaha. You are funny, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, yeah, whatever.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And, I wanted to know the name of this place.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure there is a name for it, isn't there?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me hear it.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Since ancient times, this place has been called Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela⋯what?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dela Grante?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I would like to say one thing in advance⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stuff I'm going to ask you about⋯don't ask me why I'm asking, okay?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I might ask some really basic questions.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First of all. *swallow*[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know where we are?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]My house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I already explained to you about myself⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It's your turn now.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I am the knight who serves the God-Monarch⋯ The one to watch over the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The knight that watches⋯the Border?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯ A guardian to deal with unknown intrusions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A knight⋯ That's why you have that sword.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That is correct.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Border of the country⋯ Illia, are you border patrol?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Border patrol⋯ That's an interesting name. But it is true, in some sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Monitoring and defense against intruders from the outside world, I see⋯ You call the boundary between two countries the 「Border?」[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*chuckle* I overworked myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The Border exists in various places in this country. The role of knights is to defend Dela Grante from all intruders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Intruders⋯ For example, people like me?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]No. This is my first experience of a human appearing near the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then, what do you usually deal with?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Terrifying beasts. Though they rarely appear, the knights have been trained to fight against these monsters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beasts⋯ Like carnivores?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Strong, strange beasts. Sometimes I encounter monsters I have never seen before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]But, people like you are even more rare. I've never heard of a person crossing the Border before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never, huh? So I'm a first⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Who are you? Are you from outside of the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! An earthquake?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Do not fret⋯it will stop soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're right.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]But, the intervals have gradually become shorter⋯ I wonder, perhaps it is time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Illia doesn't want to talk about herself too much⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sword right next to your bed⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]This?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, don't touch it! You freak me out.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that yours?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you keep such a dangerous thing.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That is⋯my duty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your duty?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like it's hard for her to speak⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The way you fell earlier⋯ That was not normal.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You're right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were coughing up blood⋯ Are you really okay?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It won't be long until⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until what?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*laugh* Nothing serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Stop. Illia⋯ You are my only hope.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You keep saying strange things. How can I be your only hope?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You are the only person I can communicate with now.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]How about that woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes can't speak.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]She has no voice?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, she doesn't⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know something about Celes?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It might be my imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I am⋯a little weak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not doing so hot, yeah.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯ Just a little. *cough cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ Do you want me to bring you water?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]*smile* I am fine. Thank you for taking care of me earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't do much. Anyone would do the same in that situation.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what⋯ Don't stare at me like this.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You are so strange, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes. And it's nice to talk so straightforwardly about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia⋯what are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I think it's better than standing and breathing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't forget what people say, do you?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That makes two of us.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Dela Grante is the name of the land in which the God-Monarch reigns⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way⋯ You said 「Imperial Capital,」 earlier.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. You were asking if I came from the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It was a misunderstanding. Like you said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The Imperial Capital is⋯the place where the God-Monarch, the one who rules over Dela Grante, reigns.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]God-Monarch? What's a God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]It is impossible that you do not know of the God-Monarch. Who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a long story⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You⋯came from beyond the Border?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What border?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I have heard of those who come from outside of the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Border⋯? You're introducing a ton of new words to me.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The Border is at the edge of our land⋯ It separates Dela Grante from the rest of the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Seems like you came from outside of the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Border⋯ A border line?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A border⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you mind if we go over that again?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]As you wish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where exactly is Dela Grante located on Earth?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I'm sorry, but I am not familiar with any countries named Earth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earth isn't a country.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's⋯ Hey, could you knock it off? Quit joking around![%p]
[name]Illia[line]What's Earth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seriously?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I am merely replying to your question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You can't be serious, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You can't be serious⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, where is this Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]You wanted to know where you are now, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]This is it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I asked the wrong question, apparently. Then, where exactly is Dela Grante located on Earth?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Earth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Don't tell me you don't know Earth.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]No, I do not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're joking, right?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Why do I have to joke?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh man⋯)[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The Border is what separates the countries⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, so the Border is what separates the countries⋯[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, why are you here?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Border⋯ What is this border that you're talking about?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]The Border exists at the edge of the Universe. The only point of contact with the outside world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you mind explaining it a little bit more so it's easier to understand?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]I see. You've come from the outside world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The outside world?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the Border?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Think of a borderline between two countries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A borderline⋯ Does that mean there's a country next to Dela Grante, too?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Of course⋯ Though I've never been.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a huge cliff in the middle of the forest.[%p]
[name]Illia[line]That's the Border⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's on the other side of it?[%p]
[name]Illia[line]Hard to say, since I have never been there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
