[name]Takuya[line]It's ringing so loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this on purpose?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to pick up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone is ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, on the counter. The receiver.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really not the time to be looking at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, fine. I'm getting it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello, this is Arima.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Is that you, kid?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. Who is this?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Oh, come on. Don't tell me you forgot what my voice sounds like. It's Houjou.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish I could forget that voice.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Heh heh. I was hoping you'd say that.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Actually, I was hoping to hear your mother's voice.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So? What do you want?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((You haven't changed at all, have ya?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got things to do. If you don't need anything, I'm hanging up.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((I do need something. Kanna⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Ha! You're like one of Pavlov's dogs. I could practically hear you slobbering the moment I said Kanna.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up and tell me what you want.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Uh-huh. I'm currently downtown in a caf⑮ speaking with my employer.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((My client is very upset.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you get fired?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Don't sound so hopeful when you say that, kid. I need information. And if I don't get it soon, I don't get paid.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Like I care.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((So I have to ask you something. That blue gemstone.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Blue gemstone?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Uh-huh. If you've slept with Kanna, you must have seen it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Turns out it's pretty important to her.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A blue gemstone⋯)
[name]Takuya[line](Right, the blue gemstone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I remember how much it sparkled against Kanna's neck.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Hey, what's wrong?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((You got quiet all of the sudden.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing. What about it?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Use your head, boy.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((If you were to take that from Kanna, you could use it to negotiate with her.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Negotiate?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Yeah, you know, 『If you want the jewel, tell me where to find Dr. Arima.』))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you mean blackmail.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Don't start arguing semantics with me. This is about whether or not you can get the information.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know about any gemstone.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Look, I know you fucked Kanna, so I know you saw it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I tell you I don't know, then I don't know![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Hmph. Fine.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything about this guy is irritating.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe he thinks I'd blackmail Kanna. What an asshole.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I even talking to this guy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((I'll figure some way to get that gemstone. Oh, one more thing.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((My client's got a question. They want to know if Kanna has something that seems unusual.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What kind of unusual?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Like a device or something, with jewels embedded in it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?!
[name]Houjou[line]((You know anything about that?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I do, maybe I don't.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((I see. So you're rude and angry. I guess the phone wasn't the best way to do this.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feel free to guess all you want.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Anyway, this Dr. Arima, your father? My client thinks maybe Kanna got it from him.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Can you ask her about it when you see her tonight?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who exactly is this client of yours?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((We can discuss that during our appointment tonight at ten o'clock.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((So, how about it?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna doesn't have a rock with jewels in it.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((I didn't say it was a rock with jewels in it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Fine. I guess you have the occasional slip of the tongue too.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really don't like this guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]((Okay. Ten o'clock tonight. Don't be late.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is Houjou's employer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And how does he know about the jewel?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The receiver is on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to pick up the phone.[%p]
