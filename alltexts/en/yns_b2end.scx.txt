[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's a bell ringing in my head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ring, ring⋯ It's loud.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯ That time, I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I got hit in the head⋯and collapsed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's wrong⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My body is numb⋯ It won't move.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ Argh!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can just barely twitch my fingers⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like I'm paralyzed.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Looks like he's awake.[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]Yes, sir⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That voice⋯ It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryu-Ryuusoohi, hoo⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I used a very strong sedative. You won't be able to move for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha doous aah meea?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You shouldn't speak. Mostly because you can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It seems you've been sniffing around quite a bit. You and the school physician, Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was unable to find them among Koudai Arima's research papers⋯ I have been searching for the Reflector and the Hypersense Stone for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Reflector⋯ Hyper-what?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I thought that you'd have them, but it appears I was wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The other possibility would be that female student⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Female student?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I have someone looking into it, but I don't expect much from him. Regardless, they have to be somewhere around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, I've said too much. I'm sure you don't know your circumstances yet, so I'll tell you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You are in my home, and you are tied to a table so you can't move.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You must pay the price for sniffing around with Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaar iff sseee?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She's right in front of you⋯over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The woman sitting over there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that⋯ Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](N-No way⋯did⋯he⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko!)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Uh⋯ Nnn⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ewiko![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oou bafftah, wha ih oo doo ooh Miff Ewiko?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]You're not making sense. You shouldn't talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's your fault!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She was sniffing around a bit too much. You could say she had it coming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh⋯ She and I are old friends. Maybe she came after me because she missed me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old friends⋯?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you know why she's after me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Because I took something very important from her⋯ Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something important?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now that Abel is dead, I thought I had nothing to be afraid of⋯ I never thought she'd come after me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's he talking about?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. Regardless, I plan to find both the Reflector and the Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Now, if you will, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, sir⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's all right, this shouldn't hurt.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Close⋯your eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Noo![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Close your eyes⋯now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My eyes are so heavy⋯)[%p]
I closed my eyes like a baby listening to a lullaby.[%p]
My entire body was pulled into darkness. I was surrounded by the feeling of floating.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll make you feel better now⋯ It's time for your shot.[%p]
I wanted to say I didn't want a shot, but I couldn't speak.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I love you, Takuya.[%p]
I heard the clanking sound of some kind of metal tools hitting each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This wasn't how it was supposed to be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this is where I⋯ Damn it.)[%p]
As I lost consciousness, I made one last-ditch attempt to move my arms and legs.[%p]
And then⋯[%p]
I felt something hard at my fingertip. In my dream, I pressed that thing with my finger.[%p]
It seems like I didn't belong in this world⋯[%p]
