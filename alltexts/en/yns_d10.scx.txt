[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop. Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little cold.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not yet?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. Whew! This school is pretty big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to check another grade's building.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to look in places Mio's likely to go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm, somewhere Mio goes⋯ Maybe the bathroom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Everybody has to go there eventually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll leave searching the bathrooms to you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll do that. If I find Mio in the bathroom⋯oh, look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Where?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found it in the lab. They're the reference books I lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is really important to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Great.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can tell you're very happy for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? I can't help it.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Phew! Ms. Shimazu is a pain in the ass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is being a pain in the ass just part of the princess package?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't boys think that kinda thing is cute?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. That's pretty harsh coming from you.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't freak me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dark.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't find her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How about Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He might find her downtown.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, then let's meet at the school gate in a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She's not in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What about you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm⋯ I'll search more around the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop. Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean is a little cold.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's just Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, have you seen Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]N-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you look so down?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]C-Can I help you with something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come up here?[%p]
