[name]Takuya[line](Wow, Ms. Eriko is in the school infirmary for once.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After all, she is giving me emotional distress and⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough* H-Hey, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You really, really, really, don't get it, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't say it so robustly.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If she only wants to cause you emotional suffering, she doesn't need to go to class together with you, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ You might be right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think she is voluntarily attending remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that 「You're helpless」 gesture?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're helpless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I admit that you are mentally advanced, but in regards to love affairs, you're a complete amateur.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody taught us about it in the school. I blame the Ministry of Education.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Quit your quibbling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She thinks you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* I feel silly trying to explain this to you so seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm trying to say that she seems to be worried about you, in her own way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Worried about⋯my remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, if you cut to the chase, yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that none of her business?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you don't care about her at all, I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well, of course⋯a little bit.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, so you're interested in her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't come to any strange conclusions. There's nothing between Mio and I.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I guess you're just not as sentimental as she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*smirk* Worrying can be a treasured experience when you are young. What's wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make fun of me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, whatever you do, don't ever become a man who hurts a woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Anyway, you should apologize to her for what you did earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She said what she said because she cares about you. And if you don't appreciate any of it, what else can she do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heh, don't make such a dull face. It's not like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With that comment, anyone would make a face.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She has a lot on her mind now. It seems like she also has bigger things to worry about, not just about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Worry? About what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, about her father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her father?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Uh-oh, its time for the regular staff meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Summer's only leisurely for students. Teachers are still surprisingly busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've also got a lot on my plate. Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look tired.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've been working through the night for the past few days with only short naps. I just have a strong desire to sleep, that's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're working through the night?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, you know. I'm on night shift here, grading papers and such.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Getting off the night shift is just like getting sober. Did you know that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not drinking in school, are you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Idiot, I don't drink.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, anyway, to get back to what you were saying.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's happened to Mio's father?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why don't you listen to her talk, instead of me? Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have to go now. The moral counselor might yell at me again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who's the teacher here?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You should apologize to Mio. Understand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ I got it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Good. Let's talk about it later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko has left⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Apologize to Mio? But she's the one who hit me really hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez. I'd call this gender discrimination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does Mio like me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯no way. She thinks I'm a fool but I don't think she cares about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Especially after what happened⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez. I had it coming. Anyway, I'll just apologize to her casually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Casually. Nothing formal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what was Mio talking to Ms. Eriko about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said something about Mio's father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if I'd be able to help at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Excuse me, my waist is under 24 inches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying? I'm talking about Mio.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What about her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told you something that was none of her business.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like I'm asking Yuuki to sit in for me, so do something about that or whatever.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I know you've been asking someone else to sit in for you, right from the start. It's not something I need to hear from her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, okay. Then what did Mio come to tell you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She wants me to do something about you not attending remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, what did I tell you? I can't believe she would tell on me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough* Hey, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You are so green.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Think about things more logically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Logically? Like with my left brain?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly. What does she get by making you attend remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no clue.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you don't attend remedial classes, the classes will go quietly and efficiently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that might be right. Though it doesn't sound like a compliment to me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So that means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It means that she doesn't have any benefit in making you come to remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, why did she take the time to come and talk to you about it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's why I am asking you to think logically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know! Maybe she wanted to tell you so she can be the teacher's pet?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She's an honor student. Everyone in school knows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯maybe she wants to cause me emotional distress?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Emotional distress?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to go to a boring lecture. And Mio wants me to attend those classes. Which means, she wants me to suffer emotional distress. That's logical thinking.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm, I see. But why would she need to do that to you? She should just leave you alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe she hates me that much.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, that's possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hah hah hah, don't look so worried⋯ Just think about the reverse side of the possibilities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The reverse side?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In other words, why would Mio want you to attend remedial classes by all means?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why Mio wants me to take classes, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, is this it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yup, that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I didn't say anything yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just say it for you. 「You don't have to take classes seriously, so why don't you take classes just for an hour.」 Is that it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I wouldn't say you don't have to take it serious, but you get the gist of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After all this?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why now?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ah, maybe this is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what did you want to talk about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're quite arrogant, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Duh.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, I have something to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, it's about remedial classes, right?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What? Is there something I should know about your remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oops, I just woke a sleeping dog.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph, let me guess. You probably asked someone to sit in for you of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She nailed it.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, what I wanted to talk about is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You just made it sound like it wasn't that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Even if the results are the same, the process leading to it is different. In conclusion, just show up to your remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You actually sound like a teacher.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I am a teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't look like one, which is what makes you attractive.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're blushing.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ahem. Anyway, go to class, even just for an hour. You can even sleep there, if you'd like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does that make any sense? What's the difference from asking someone to sit in for me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, there's meaning to attending class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sure seem to love people watching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is hidden by her hair, as usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, I want to be buried on those hills.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hey, what are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Curiosity is a good thing. Even school teachers say that![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]While we're on the subject, don't try sneaking your hand up to touch anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, no?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No means no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what about that magnificent fullness?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something's bothering me, though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chest and those thighs. I don't know. It makes me a little excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not to mention that V-neck⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can feel your face pressed right between my breasts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a whole different kind of encounter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those clothes are pretty short.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This could be a real problem.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you bending down in front of me like that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You do look more official when you wear that coat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, I've never seen a doctor wear clothes as form-fitting as those.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even her bangs are long, so long I can hardly see her eyes. She tied the rest back and threw it over her shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's wrong with your hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets as always.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
