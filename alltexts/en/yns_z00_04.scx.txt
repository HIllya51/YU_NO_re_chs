[name]Takuya[line]This is a home, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think anyone's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point thinking about it. Let's go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, why am I outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No point in staying here. Let's go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems that there are no signs of any people around, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a house in the middle of a rather large field.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Worn down grass and visible ground would mean that people frequently come and go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe no one lives here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is no sign of⋯anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, there's a house in front of you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone lives here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone lives here⋯for sure⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could be living here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wooden architectural style stays relatively cool inside because the warm air escapes outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone gathers in the center of the room, that's how the circle of warmth is formed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Therefore, it is a theory that this style will be seen more often in ethnic groups who value peace and wholesomeness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the contrary, stone houses do not let warm air escape outside, meaning that it is warm all around inside. So, residents can do whatever they want, wherever they want inside the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some scholars view this architectural style as the prototype of individualism, which is common in Europe and the United States.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, haha. Just talking to myself.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, it is certain that someone lives here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In Japan, we basically have more wooden structures⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These people may be a living in a relatively individualistic culture since this was built from stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯you're asking me why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like it was built by piling up stones⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Architectural style of solid stones⋯ This is unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is quite difficult to pile up these stones, though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who built this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like there are thin layers of moss on the surface of the stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means this wasn't built recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a mushroom⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you touch it, it will spit out smoke like spores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Also, Celes would laugh at me⋯ Well, it's better than making her cry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*spit* Eww, it spit out some spores⋯ Ugh.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's laughing at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange plants⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have never seen this plant before⋯ It looks like cotton on mushrooms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, we are not going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to go back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if you go back, you're coming back here, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Therefore, I'm not going back. Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We just came from there. I know it's not far away, but still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Back and forth⋯what I am doing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who used to live here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look at me like that, you're fine. I'm just peeking inside.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just wait here.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to be my partner in crime.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want to come with me?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well⋯ Let's go in together![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could be living here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me! Is anyone here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A kitchen with a table, chairs, and some shelves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surprisingly livable⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am pretty sure someone lives here, or used to live here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone might answer if I try knocking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯should I just knock?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I can't go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm already inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is inside, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe look for just a little bit longer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knocked, but no answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, one more time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯ I should knock on this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made of wood. The structure is made of stone and wood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is not the time to knock on your head⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's investigate inside a bit more, shall we?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good, my brain is still there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*knock knock*⋯ Yes, I'm using the stool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't let me act so stupid.[%p]
