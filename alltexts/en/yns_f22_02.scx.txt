[name]Takuya[line]There are flowers here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she leave them there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's been a lot of talk about all of those construction accidents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe the flowers are for the person that died.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's related to whoever died.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]The old religious people say that accident happened because the spirits that live on Triangle Mountain were angry.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I did see that woman last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that woman one of the spirits the old people talk about?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Flowers at Triangle Mountain⋯[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of stories and legends about this mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyone who was a little religious would do this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
