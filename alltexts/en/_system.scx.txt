The first night.
Yu-No Route
Promise to fulfill the most important⋯
Mitsuki Route
Where did Ayumi, Ryuuzouji⋯and Kanna go?
Where am I? The shrine⋯? Why am I crying?
Where am I? What happened? Ayumi?
Where am I? What happened? Chaos Correction?
Huh? Isn't this the shrine? I was just underneath Triangle Mountain and died with Mitsuki⋯ It was all a dream? What's going on?
Huh? Isn't this the shrine? I was just underneath Triangle Mountain and died with Yuuki⋯ It was all a dream? What's going on?
Huh? I thought I met Kanna at the school infirmary. But⋯ I'm at the shrine now?
Mio's so rich, she wouldn't know what a 1000 yen bill even looks like. Haha, what am I talking about?
Ayumi⋯ Where are you?
Is my bastard of a father playing a prank on me?
Not in Father's study⋯
Day 1
The worst awakening.
Ayumi is at school?
Let's hurry to the school.
Ryuuzouji isn't acting like himself. What's going on?
I have to go find Ayumi!
With Ms. Eriko, the chain-smoker.
With Kanna, the transfer student.
Ayumi isn't here⋯ Did we miss each other?
I wonder what Mitsuki wants to talk about⋯ But Ayumi is more important right now. We should inspect her usual spot.
Nobody's at the coastline⋯ Ayumi⋯
What did I experience last night⋯?
She's a transfer student, so maybe that's why Kanna is always alone.
Kanna Route
All the other girls at school are ugly on the inside⋯ I believe Kanna is different.
Ayumi is going to the briefing now⋯
Mitsuki⋯ It's been a while.
I studied how the world works today.
I wonder if Kanna went to the beach.
Must be tough for Ayumi.
What's going on with the construction? Isn't the geological survey underway?
There's a plan to tear down Triangle Mountain? I can't believe it.
The spirit of Triangle Mountain⋯
Nurse. Noun. A person trained to care for the sick. Got it?
I said I'd nurse Kanna back to health. So this is purely for medical purposes. *gulp*
Did something happen while I was caring for Kanna?
I can't believe Ayumi would resume the hauling, but⋯could the company have ordered it without her?
They said they were throwing eggs at her. I hope Ayumi is okay⋯
She's gorgeous. Could that be her mom?
This is the moment of truth. Time to grow closer to Kanna.
Walking a girl home, hoping to get lucky? Sorry, I'm too stupid to understand what that means.
The old man's lover⋯ Nah, that's just a rumor⋯
I just want to give back Kanna's student notebook as soon as I can.
She'd fainted in the entrance. If I hadn't come back to return her student notebook⋯
I'm worried about Ayumi, but I need to give Kanna the medicine for her fever.
I heard sirens coming from the beach. Could it be an accident?
Kaori Route
What's the alarm for?
The fever medicine, or breaking and entering⋯ That's an easy choice.
I know what I heard, but I have to deliver the fever medication to Kanna.
Can you believe it? I get the feeling I'm being taken for a ride.
Who is this Houjou dude, and what's he got to do with Kanna?
I guess a beauty is bound to end up with a beast, huh. There's no point thinking about it. 
Don't tell me something happened while I was wasting time⋯
The photo in the bankbook has me worried. But, whenever Kanna moves, I remember⋯ Aah, my nose started bleeding.
Day 2
I guess I'm the type that gets easily influenced.
The homemade cooking was delicious. Plus, she looked so cute in that apron⋯ If she'd been naked⋯*gulp*
I wonder why I'm so interested in Kanna⋯
There's nothing dirty on my mind⋯ To be honest, it's a bit relieving.
An accident, now? I really hope Ayumi is okay.
Twin Boulders for lovers⋯ That sounds so sad⋯
Ah⋯ I can't help but wander there⋯
A mountain of problems⋯ I hope Ayumi doesn't collapse out of fatigue.
I don't think I can get along with some dude who thinks a detective agency can look elegant.
Well, I better work as much as I can right now.
Kanna was expelled? Oh, I need to hurry up about that money issue too. Geez.
The client knows about the Jewels?
But maybe the Ryuuzouji that I met at the shrine might⋯
Immortality? Didn’t someone say that was the focus of my father’s research? No way,sounds like a movie I saw last night⋯
Why does Kanna remind me of my mother?
Let's hurry to Room 1101.
Do you remember the details of the deal?
This is like a truce⋯but we can't let our guard down.
With that face, the old bastard⋯ Gah, I better concentrate. Let's see how I can infiltrate the place⋯
Should I wait quietly for Kaori?
This is Ayumi's office.
So, this was Kaori's destination.
Am I sure I should hand it over?
What do I do?
I've already experienced this. Sorry, Kaori.
She's gone in an instant. As expected of an industrial spy.
Damn! She's so fast!
Where did Kaori go?!
Even if I told Ayumi everything that happened, she wouldn't believe me.
Ayumi⋯ I wonder if she'll believe me.
Kanna isn't at the coastline⋯
Was this⋯for the best?
Wait⋯where's Kanna?
What's Kanna's relation to my father?
Oh, right. I stayed over in Kanna's room last night.
Kanna likes green⋯ Let's take this step-by-step⋯
I hope Kanna and I are a little closer now⋯
Ayumi is still at work⋯
Another accident⋯ Did Kanna foresee this?
Why would she research so much about some rocks? Yuuki sure picked a strange one.
I wonder if Kanna is here. I miss her.
Confidential information was leaked⋯ Well, at least thanks to that, I didn't get reprimanded for staying out so late.
Maybe he got sent to a time where something happened to the old man.
So Kanna and my father are⋯
Whether to find Kanna or⋯ Wait, something was dropped before that⋯
I heard that Kanna dropped out of school. Damn, I have to find her, fast.
The bastard's client seems to know about the Jewels for some reason. Why?
Not Ryuuzouji. Right now, I have to find Kanna.
No way⋯
She likes dogs⋯ I always want to be by her side, watching her smile.
That woman⋯
No matter how often I see it, she still looks amazing in that outfit⋯
Ms. Eriko⋯ I never knew she was a skin-tight clothes enthusiast⋯
It's 9pm⋯ There's still an hour before the meeting with the old man.
I think he mentioned something about a rock.
Kanna was looking for that necklace from before⋯ And the way she was treated⋯ That bastard⋯
What a scumbag. If he does anything to Kanna, he'll never see the light of day again!
It seems like that necklace was very important⋯ And still, she did that for me⋯
Please open your eyes⋯ I want to hear you speak⋯ I want to see you smile⋯ Aren't we supposed to live together? Please answer me.
It may sound like a manga or anime, but the phrase “mysterious transfer student” fits her perfectly.
Ryuuzouji's manor is the origin of the curse?
Too scared to go outside because of the curse?
Yuuki's obsession with the occult is thanks to Mio.
Ms. Asakura? What's she got to do with Ayumi?
Ms. Eriko also likes the occult?
Ayumi⋯ I hope she doesn't get sick.
I picked up the phone in Ayumi's room. Has no one noticed?
Mitsuki wanted to talk about Ryuuzouji⋯ But I know next to nothing.
Ms. Eriko could be wandering around buck naked somewhere⋯ Nah, no way.
That was some nonstop verbal vomiting.
Geez⋯ Remedial classes are tiring⋯
It's still difficult. For now, I'll be like the wind.
I guess he's a different person than the Ryuuzouji from last night⋯
If Triangle Mountain really disappears⋯
Kanna looks great in her regular clothes, all I ever see is her uniform⋯ Whoops, it's time for my meeting with Mitsuki.
Speaking of which, why is Mio attending remedial classes? Is it some weird thing her hyper-student brain wants to do?
Let's just enjoy this alone time with Mitsuki.
Since Mitsuki asked me, I better check up on Ryuuzouji.
Advice? We should ask Mitsuki.
I don't have any real purpose, but I should head downtown.
A healthy young man would obviously prioritize that hot lady.
How did a hot lady turn into some old dude?! Please tell me this is a nightmare!
Are you kidding me?! You chose some dude over the hot lady?!
I think I should have asked for more details. In any case, I need to be careful about this Toyotomi guy. 
She can't even speak her thoughts⋯ Is her work really that overwhelming?
Who knows what might come out next⋯ Just do or die.
Ryuuzouji knows something. There must be a way to find out.
Ms. Eriko was trying to break into Ryuuzouji's home?
Ayumi! Your clothes! Hey, cover your eyes! Wait, who am I talking to?
I got sent to the time when Ayumi thought I was some creep.
Who are you? What do you have to do with my father?
Did lightning strike again while I was asleep?
Someone saw me arrive. Not being considerate like that makes it feel less like a dream.
Is Kanna sick?
I got sent to the time when I met Kanna outside the school infirmary.
Ms. Eriko knows something about Mitsuki⋯
Another dilapidated storehouse⋯
The inside and outside are equally ruined⋯
That sound⋯ I have a bad feeling about this⋯
There's no way I'll appear stuck in a wall⋯ That'd be game over. Now, let's see what time I've arrived at.
Please, don't let me starve to death in the storehouse⋯
No, my life isn't flashing before my eyes⋯ I'm dreaming because these old books are too boring.
I dropped the rope into the well and found a medal. Also, a piece of a diary told me to open a door somewhere.
A mature kiss⋯ That was amazing⋯
W-What was that sound? This place is rumored to be cursed, so I'm kinda⋯
Well, if she's offering, I'm obligated as a healthy young man to⋯
For a teacher at school, Ms. Eriko takes way too many walks! (Maybe she dropped the lipstick.)
It's not just the lipstick, but her fragrance as well! That was close⋯
Ryuuzouji's garden seen from the rooftop⋯ I can see everything⋯ No way⋯ Haha⋯ Must be my imagination.
It was Mio and Yuuki at the shrine⋯ If they're on a date, why not go somewhere with a better atmosphere?
I wonder what would've happened if I got caught inside the locker⋯ Heh.
The hot lady was actually Ms. Eriko?!
I saw something I never wanted to see⋯ Ayumi⋯
Is there something mysterious inside this dilapidated storehouse? Like some ancient texts?
Just a bit more⋯ I wonder if⋯
Ayumi⋯ Damn it, I gotta do something!
It looks like Mitsuki was also worried.
Monsters in modern day Japan⋯ What's going on?!
Ryuuzouji's mother⋯ What's going on?!
Not normal⋯? But you're a teacher⋯shouldn't you be giving me a few more details?
If I said everything, she might get mad⋯ I should think about this seriously⋯
I'm so sorry⋯ I guess this isn't normal⋯
Ayumi Route
Mio, the stuck-up princess⋯
Not bad for a nobody⋯ Let's hurry to the coast.
Not bad for a nobody⋯ You know where to go for the inspection⋯
Mio went to the shrine⋯ Is Ayumi at the company building?
According to the guard, Ayumi already went home⋯
Why is Mio bothering to check the shrine anyway?
Ayumi doesn't remember anything.
He pisses me off⋯ To think he's Ayumi's underling. I feel bad for her.
Kanna is immoral? What is Mio talking about?
What did Mitsuki want to talk about?
I wonder what's the briefing about in the afternoon.
There could be more victims today or tomorrow⋯
Apologize to Mio? Ms. Eriko can be so nosy⋯
Being told to apologize makes you not want to. Right?
I'm supposed to watch News Presence?
Lightning on a sunny day? You gotta be kidding.
Yuuki must be serious⋯
The stuck-up princess is actually feeling down.
Mio Route
Me, jealous of Yuuki? I'm speechless.
The stuck-up princess would look cute if she kept quiet and just smiled.
Ayumi⋯ I hope she's not hurt. I'm worried⋯
What's this rumor about Kanna?
What's Mr. Porno Director up to? Pinning all the blame on Ayumi⋯
It's been a while since we were alone. You're as beautiful as ever, Mitsuki.
Find the “LEGACY” that Mio left behind by going to the laboratory at school.
You found the “LEGACY,” so hurry to the caf⑮.
I wonder what's the deal with those two⋯ I better just go and hand this over. I haven't forgotten where to go, I think.
You didn't have to sleep under the bed⋯ Is this Abel guy she's muttering about her boyfriend?
I managed to return that lost item, so I better pray that she doesn't get irritated all of a sudden⋯
Beige, huh⋯? Hmm?
It's Mio's room.
I'm sure her father is pleased to see Mio turn out like this.
I was sent to the time period when I was in Mio's room asking about Sword Cape.
I'll head to the coast later⋯ Right now, I have to see Mio.
The moonlight only makes you more beautiful, Mio⋯ Hah! You thought I'd actually say that?
It's better than not doing first aid.
Even if I'm getting something out of it⋯ I better focus!
Ugh⋯ My arms feel like they're gonna fall off⋯
I desperately carried his injured daughter all the way here, and for that I'm nearly pumped full of holes! What kind of family is this?!
Sharing a bed with Mio⋯ Remember⋯ Remember⋯ Gah! I can't remember anything!
I could have figured it out if I thought about it⋯ Like father like son⋯ I should stop jumping to conclusions all the time.
Yuuki⋯seems pretty upset about what happened to Mio.
Mio is moving overseas. I don't like how this is ending.
After talking to Mitsuki, I think I'm able to put my thoughts together.
Ayumi⋯ I'm sorry I lied to you⋯ But I didn't mean any harm⋯ Although I don't remember it⋯
Even Yuuki can't find Mio⋯ Where did she go?
If he's an underling, the least he could do is not give Ayumi any trouble.
Things look busy at Mio's place⋯
Maybe Yuuki knows something⋯
Kaori Asakura and Ryuuzouji⋯ A newscaster and the headmaster⋯ Hmm⋯ How are these two related?
I don't think it's wise to ignore Kanna by calling her crazy⋯
According to Ms. Eriko, Mio went to the coastline.
I managed to schedule a meeting with Ryuuzouji so he can show me the tapestry.
This place is so big, I can't see it all from the outside⋯
Did something happen a month ago?
Let's check out the tapestry.
The three of us should work together and find Mio before things get more serious.
I found the bag at Triangle Mountain.
Kanna again⋯ There must be something here.
He's going to be my rival for love? You never know what happens in life.
Did I choose the wrong person?
Mitsuki⋯ I'll probably be killed by her⋯
I feel so⋯tired⋯
I got separated from Yuuki⋯
Should I reunite with Yuuki⋯? Eh, maybe not⋯ Just kidding.
What item can I use to break down this door?
Yuuki! Answer me! Yuuki!!
I didn't know there was a burial chamber like this under Triangle Mountain⋯
An underground lake? Where am I⋯? I must be dreaming!
Mio⋯ I'm so glad you're safe⋯ I-I'm not crying⋯*sniff*
Yes⋯ It all started with that woman⋯ Just who is she?
Mio⋯
Day 3
Mom⋯?
A woman guided me to this giant device⋯
Damn! Another door is blocking my path, and after coming all this way too!
I didn't know the medal could be used this way⋯
I didn't know Triangle Mountain and the well at Ryuuzouji's manor were connected⋯
Sorry, Mio⋯ But I did promise to go back and rescue⋯
To think that Yuki would be my rival for love⋯ You never know what happens in life⋯
This cave was probably man-made.
I heard something from far away⋯ Did I make a mistake?
Looks like the door opened⋯
The door is open, but the lights are⋯ I better go and find Mio for Mitsuki's sake. Then I should get out of here.
Damn! The door separated me from Mitsuki.
I have to go and rescue Mitsuki!
Mitsuki is right in front of me! Is there an item I can use to break down the door?
Mitsuki! Please answer me! Mitsuki!
It's⋯a small, underground room?
It must be nice to be unconscious right now. Fine, I'll check it out myself⋯
Why is Mitsuki pointing a gun at me?
Is Ryuuzouji ordering Mitsuki to do this? How is that even possible?
What should I do? In order to escape the electrical discharge⋯
Mitsuki⋯ Ryuuzouji, I will make you pay for this!
A briefing⋯ I hope Ayumi is all right.
I-It's a coincidence⋯ That's right! It's all about the feeling! *gulp*
Pinning the blame for the lightning on Ayumi⋯ I'll get back at that underling someday⋯
Right now, I'm more concerned about the lightning than Mio⋯
Maybe Kanna knows something about this⋯
It's for that cute nobody⋯ Guess I'll go and get yelled at for her sake.
The school at night⋯ Now, let's go get scolded⋯
All this for some cute nobody. I'll go say farewell to the stuck-up princess.
It's either Mio or the idiot⋯ Is this the ultimate choice?
The school infirmary's light is on⋯ No way⋯
I was wondering why there were clothes strewn about except for her bra⋯ She's so weird⋯
That idiot has Ayumi's photo⋯ He's up to no good⋯
This looks dangerous⋯
An idiot talking to yakuza while a woman takes secret pictures of them⋯ Obviously, something's up.
Kaori⋯ Asakura.
I've never seen Ayumi so drunk.
There's a lotta stuff bothering me, but right now I need to get medicine for Ayumi.
There's no way she'll be fine in that state! I should go to her office.
I have a bad feeling about this. Ayumi, please be safe!
Damn it! I won't let Ayumi feel this miserable ever again!
My father⋯ Why can't that idiot be here when he's needed?!
I was supposed to feel happy now that we can be a real family⋯ But something feels wrong⋯
He's always weird, so I shouldn't be surprised⋯ But something feels wrong.
*gulp* *gulp* *gulp*⋯ I'll expose that porno director⋯
What were they doing inside the company building?
I managed to get inside the company building, but where is Ayumi?
This reminds me old times⋯ It might seem like a bad idea, but I know I can tell Mitsuki anything.
Ayumi⋯ Damn! Of all places, I was sent to this moment⋯
Mitsuki⋯ Thank you⋯
I don't have any business with Yuuki⋯
The board of directors meeting⋯ I wonder if Ayumi is all right.
I have to talk with Ayumi⋯ After all, we're family⋯
I'm sure we can come to an understanding if we talk.
Ayumi⋯ She'll understand if we talk.
She didn't understand⋯ We just argued⋯
Yuuki⋯ If he wants something, why didn't he just say so?
Kaori Asakura⋯ Who is she⋯?
Mio is gone? Oh, well⋯ I guess I'll try to look for her on the way⋯
The gym bag with panties inside was behind the Twin Boulders⋯ No way⋯ Wait, there aren't any panties inside⋯
I didn't understand what they were saying⋯ But is Kaori Asakura a spy?
Ayumi is either in town or at the company building⋯
I wonder who's on a date with Ms. Eriko⋯ Maybe it's that Abel guy she mentioned while she was sleeping.
The company seems to be in an uproar about something⋯
Is it really okay to take the deal? Who cares, just do it!
With these secret documents, I think I can save Ayumi⋯
I should have agreed to the deal.
Eat this, you bastard!
Damn! If only I had proof!
I see⋯ So since then, Kaori was⋯
Ayumi! Please don't be rash!
Ayumi! Don't do anything rash!
I didn't think I'd end up like this with Ayumi⋯ I would never have believed it⋯
How long has it been since I relaxed? A long time, if you ask me⋯
Other World Route
That old bastard⋯ Why did he hide it here?
Damn that old bastard⋯ Just you wait⋯
I'll make the old bastard explain what's happening. Even if I have to beat it out of him!
What is the name of the God-Monarch?
Yu-No⋯
Ryuuzouji⋯ Where did you go?
I better go obtain something related to the company⋯ You know what I mean, right? You gotta do that thing.
Should I have shown the card to that security guard?
Mitsuki⋯ I'm going now⋯ I'll do the best I can⋯
Yuuki⋯ Your sacrifice won't go to waste⋯ Damn, I can't think of a clever joke⋯ Yuuki⋯
I've been had! But I'll learn from this, Kaori Asakura!
I know it might be a trap, but still⋯ Damn it!
I'll try to get back our time together for the three of us⋯ Ayumi⋯
Ayumi, I'm sorry I couldn't take care of everything⋯
I'll go and find my father. Please wait for me, Ayumi⋯
Ayumi⋯ I'm sorry I caused so much trouble for you⋯
I'll end everything⋯and come back to you.
I don't know when to give up⋯ This is a temporary separation. I'll bring the stone and come back. I promise⋯
Ms. Eriko⋯ Dammit! Mitsuki, please don't do this. I can't accept this ending⋯
Mitsuki⋯ I'll try⋯to change your fate. I won't accept this.
I passed out at Ryuuzouji's manor and⋯ I'm at the school infirmary now?
Whoa! It's so bright!
Kanna?
Mio⋯ I don't want to vanish⋯ Mio⋯
Please open your eyes, Ayumi⋯ Come on, Ayumi⋯ I can't accept this!
Ayumi⋯please respond.
Looks like that was the correct answer, but⋯what's going on?
Maybe it's a different person from Ryuuzouji? And Kanna⋯ You must know something!
Ryuuzouji!
I have to get out of here! You should know what to do!
I will never forget this pain!
I was so close to getting cursed⋯
