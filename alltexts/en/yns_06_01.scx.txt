[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I'm the only one in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko wasn't in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That word she whispered into my ear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to the school infirmary and check.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems all the students have already left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need to go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The remedial classes are over, but there are still a lot of students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's never a dull moment here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are these guys doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night already? I think I'm the only one in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gates will be closed soon. I need to hurry up and get over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one here in the school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are still a few students in this hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there are still a few stragglers in this hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just as I thought. She's not here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did we miss each other?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see Ayumi anywhere, but it sounds like she's somewhere in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should find Ayumi and ask her what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back when it was in style, someone put lighting all over this room. It's stupid, really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All it does is make my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's what they call indirect lighting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Indirect lighting is supposed to be done with some kind of padding on the cover or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's night time right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be releasing stuffy CO2.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it⋯ Plants perform photosynthesis during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it should be increasing oxygen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, it's this thing's fault⋯ Plants take in oxygen, which increases CO2 in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why it's so stuffy in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is probably the only one using it, since she's the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there an ashtray in the school's hall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it for guests?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a circular sofa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to be some kind of artwork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An 「exhibit.」 That's what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a strange object hanging from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it's supposed to represent the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know who drew the big picture there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to represent the sun⋯ I think I learned that when I started here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone told me that skylight opens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you open that? It is electric?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stars are shining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a skylight to bring in more light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes it bright and pleasant in here.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your current coordinate values. You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's more written below⋯[%p]
「Be on the lookout for your current completion rate as well. Please use these in conjunction with each other.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there are any new postings.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your coordinate values on your map.」[%p]
「You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it mean? I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]You'd better stop rubbing your cheeks against it.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]*sniff sniff* I smell something nice.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]*sniff sniff* It smells just like Mitsuki Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Oh, I see![%p]
[name]Male Student[line]It's the jacket Mitsuki was wearing.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I don't know where Ms. Ichijou is.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What? She called you?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Well, they call them remedial classes for a reason. I don't have any more remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Ms. Ichijou? I don't know where she went.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]We're going to school for club activities.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]We have to work hard today. Of course, half of it is out of obligation.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Oh, Ms. Ichijou? She was looking for someone, but she left.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What's wrong with Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I am tired of sitting.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I want to stand and walk.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]There's a guy standing in front of that bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]He's been babbling about something weird for a while now. I wonder if he's okay⋯[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I've never heard the name Ayumi outside of the shop.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh? Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]A girl named Ayumi works in the shop I usually go to.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Excuse me⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Did you find Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It seems like you're looking for something.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I long for Ms. Ichijou⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Ms. Ichijou? She went home. Looks like she forgot something.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Ms. Ichijou is so intelligent and elegant⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The guy she's dating must be absolutely rich and handsome.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What are you doing? Why are you pointing at yourself? You're weird.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh my, I want to do that.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Of course, Mahjong. Mahjong.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What? Are you asking me if I know your father?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you asking me if I know your mother?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]No, I do not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, so I'll fail once or twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got a nosebleed so bad it's dripping onto your fist, you dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I really want to go swimming in the ocean, but⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I heard there was another accident last night, so there's no way.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The remedial classes are over now. Did you pass them all?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]It's a little strange for Mio, the top student, to be taking remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I wonder why she took remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Don't pull up my skirt.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Watch out for women like that.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Their moods change like the flip of a switch.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You want to know if I'm like that. Haha! That's a secret.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry, I don't know.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you asking me if I saw Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, I'm not sure. What does she look like?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Glasses, braided hair, older but attractive⋯ She's your mother?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You're having naughty thoughts, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]If you pull up my skirt, it'll cost you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What doesn't she know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll ask. Hey![%p]
[name]Student[line]Never heard of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people attending club activities look much more relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are all those guys in remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yes? What?[%p]
[name]Student[line]There is something interesting written on this bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, long time no see. Nice to see you again.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got good news to share, but it's kind of a long story.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]It takes a while to explain, but do you wanna hear?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]I'll tell you, just this once.[%p]
[name]Student[line]There's a special gate somewhere in this world.[%p]
[name]Student[line]It will take you from here to another place and transition you to another time⋯ Call it a warp zone.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But be careful, the are some places you can only access through that.[%p]
[name]Student[line]If you find yourself in a completely different time and place, don't panic.[%p]
[name]Student[line]See you in another world. Maybe I'll give you another hint next time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]Shh⋯ I'm experiencing the waves of the world right now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got some information to share with you, but it'll take time to explain.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]It takes a while to explain, but do you wanna hear?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]I'll tell you, just this once.[%p]
[name]Student[line]That Reflector you have has room for ten stones.[%p]
[name]Student[line]When you touch a stone, it will halt the current time and space, and instantaneously disappear from your sight.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well then, you should probably open the map.[%p]
[name]Student[line]If you look closely, you'll see special marks on the map.[%p]
[name]Student[line]You may no longer be able to see it, but it is not lost.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Regardless of where you are, as long as you can see the branching map, you can return to that place and time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But be careful.[%p]
[name]Student[line]To open a branch map, you need at least one stone.[%p]
[name]Student[line]If you use up all the stones, you won't be able to open a branch map, and you'll have no choice but to explore without it.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Basic means of exploring will still be available, but it won't be easy.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Be very careful.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Oh, and there's some interesting stuff written on this bulletin board. You should read the whole thing.[%p]
[name]Student[line]When we meet again in another parallel world, I may just give you another hint.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Principal Ryuuzouji's home is pretty creepy, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Somehow I get a chill every time I walk past there.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm exhausted from all the remedial classes and club activities. I need to recover.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Please don't bother me.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry. I heard we can get pregnant just from talking to guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You want to know who I think is more attractive between Ms. Takeda and Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Ms. Takeda is very glamorous, but she's not very respectable.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Now, Ms. Ichijou is very respectable and intelligent.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]But Ms. Ichijou is a bit unapproachable, don't you think?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Ms. Takeda is very friendly⋯ What do you mean that's not what you wanted to know?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm exhausted from all the remedial classes and club activities. I need to recover.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Please don't bother me.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry. I heard we can get pregnant just from talking to guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]School rules. It's in the student handbook and everything.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Of course, it's not true.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm sorry. I heard we can get pregnant just from talking to guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Arima? Aren't you the one they call Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Are you⋯ Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Uh, I don't think so. Who is she?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What? Your mother?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]So the rumors are true. You are a shameless flirt.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Why do you look so sad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may not see it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know everything about the school, but I know a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a school building directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary and offices are on the first floor down the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our classrooms are on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to touch some stranger's foot, especially if I don't know whether it's a man or woman.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle rustle*[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sometimes a joke is just a joke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*spit*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to stop. I'm tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle rustle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dusty.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]In case anyone didn't already know, I'm a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯shouldn't have touched you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around in the school hallway isn't going to get anything done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanted to check in with Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would she say that⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to the school infirmary and find out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not long ago, I was wandering in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko might not be back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is in a staff meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. Kanna just left the school infirmary, so Ms. Eriko must be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should ask her about last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to the school infirmary or not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]School infirmary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's where I should be going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I go there, I don't think Ms. Eriko is in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I could go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ms. Eriko is here in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's probably appalled at how foolish I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Geez⋯ Only one way to find out. Time to go to the infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll probably get angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I'll go to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I'm being mocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, how should I enter this time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going there over and over is just gonna annoy Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I could go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to bother Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess I could go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way to the school infirmary. I wonder if Ms. Eriko is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go check out the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could go up to the second floor, but I doubt anyone is there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. Mitsuki called, didn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, I guess I'll go up to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the second floor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Mitsuki went outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going back to the second floor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. The place I'm looking for is on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Off to the second floor![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I'm the only one in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I need to find Ms. Eriko first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to know what she meant to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come into the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is off performing an inspection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]While she's doing an inspection, she has to stay focused. She can't be thinking of others.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go outside?[%p]
