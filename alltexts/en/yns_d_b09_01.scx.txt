[name]Takuya[line]It's like this path goes on forever.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I bet things will change up ahead⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The path is forked.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ground is all wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where the water is flowing from.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Is this groundwater?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the dampness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see some jagged, bare rocks.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's cold. There's cold water running here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hardly see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going to look at something, I might as well look where the light is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'm going to keep moving ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I'm going to head back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. I can't use that now.[%p]
