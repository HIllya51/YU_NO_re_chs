[name]Takuya[line]Is it fun staring at houses? Let's go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like no one but me is around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's much quieter than usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house I thought I left is right there in front of me again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I got sent back down to the foothills when I reached the top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the house Celes and I live in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I'd be leaving this place for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I should just take a dump and get to bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I don't want to move any more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came from that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is my house after all. No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. Let's try doing something less silly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, and here I am trying to tell you how down I feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're in now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sprays out smoke. We really shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Touching this will make it spit out smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In this past week, I've experienced so much that I'm getting sick of it.[%p]
