[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the sanctuary, right? Let's check things out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an entrance to the mountain. Let's go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try going inside⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be the sacred place Sala told us about.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. Just don't stray too far from me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, this is the sacred place Sala mentioned.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Let's go back. My heart's beating really fast![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll just be a little longer. Let me check this out some more.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some kind of entrance at the front.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, it's so dark that I didn't notice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some kind of entrance at the front.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can we get in through there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they cut this out of a mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't really look like any kind of building.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It looks so hard it could hurt if you touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. It looks like they cut this out of a mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a mountain in front of us?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Is that the tem-ple?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure. But according to Sala, it must be so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These stones are all lined up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what they mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rocks look like they hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like they're inviting us to the temple.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What does it mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who knows⋯ Maybe it's just a kind of trail marker.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These stairs look like they go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These are stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They lead inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a staircase right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we go up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did we come here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to look a little more into this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second, there's still stuff I want to check out.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Let's go back, Dad.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad! I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. Yu-No, you stay here, okay?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't want to go inside, do you?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I don't, but what about you, Dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I'll just go in and check things out. I'll be right back. It'll only take a minute.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just wait here. If anything happens, call for me. You got it?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be back before you know it.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, just be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Everything's gonna be okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The temple⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She called it a sacred place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could be inside?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I'm going in⋯)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it, Yu-No? Why do you look so worried?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad, I don't think you should go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I just⋯have a feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]My chest hurts. It feels like my heart is going to burst.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No is definitely sensing something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something that I can't perceive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No can't hide her uneasiness even as she stands right next to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could be inside this temple?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯ Let's go back![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No seems to be sensing something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's making her uneasy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not just uneasy⋯ She's afraid of something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Hey, Dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm so nervous⋯ My heart is beating fast and my chest hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably from walking through that desert.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]No. It's different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It feels the same as when Mom died.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When Celes died⋯?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's just like then⋯ My heart is pounding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be that Yu-No is sensing something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
