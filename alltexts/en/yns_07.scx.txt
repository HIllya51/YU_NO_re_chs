[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, someone came out of the lab.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya. Remedial classes again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I've already finished everything I needed to for today.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. I'm sure that will ease Ayumi's mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing in this quiet laboratory during summer vacation?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Just looking for something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looking for something?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, if you're looking for something, I can help you.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I appreciate the sentiment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, Ayumi was⋯my stepmother was looking for you. I heard she went to your house.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, I must have missed her. I suppose I'll go back then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But this laboratory is such a mess. Oh well, I'll find it eventually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you looking for?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it like a book or something?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh. His facial expression changed.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Why would you think that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I just thought, since you were in the lab, it must be a book or something.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm. Well, it's something like that. I'll come back again later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking for something in the lab, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like Mitsuki said something about that before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Completing a full day like that just makes you feel great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My classes are over and I did everything I have to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's one thing that concerns me, it's Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She ended up not coming to class today. The whole reason I came was to see her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what was up with that phone call last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I would see her if I came to school today. Guess I was wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You look pretty busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My, my⋯ The princess.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What have you even done today? All you did was sleep. Unbelievable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I may have looked like I was lightly napping, but let me assure you I was actually sound asleep.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What the heck? That doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thinking while I'm sound asleep is my style.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sure the only things on your mind are food or girls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I, an animal?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Can't you think of anything more serious?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've had serious thoughts.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a secret.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmmph. Too bad Ms. Ichijou didn't come today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you say that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh you know why. The minute Ms. Ichijou's substitute got there, you tried to leave. You're so easy to read.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Miss Mio![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that voice⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Are you all right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why would you ask?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I mean, wasn't there another lightning strike last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A lightning strike?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm just so, so worried. You said you wanted to go to Sword Cape last night, Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sorry. I'm not feeling very well. I'm going to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, the school infirmary? I'll be right there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*sigh* I'm worried about Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aaah!? You're here, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was here the whole time. Thanks for ignoring me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ah⋯haha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you so, so worried about? Sheesh.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry⋯ It must be nice to be in a class with Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No it isn't! She glared at me the whole time.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's nice. I wish she'd stare at me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Listen, class is over so I'm going home.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay, I'll see you later then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes? What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're not done talking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not sure what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I don't know what you mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean tell me the details![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um, well first I'll go meet Miss Mio at the school infirmary, then I'll go home with her. Hopefully I can invite her for some tea and⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not asking what your stupid plans are. Tell me about the accident.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, it was quite a commotion down at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. It seems they were moving something and then boom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would they be moving at night?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not sure. I don't know the construction schedule.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm sure they'll write about it in this evening's newspaper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Another lightning strike at the coastline.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And they were moving something?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What's the matter? You look like you caught your thingy in your zipper.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a weird metaphor.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I just meant that you were making a very serious face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am serious.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a thing for Mio.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whaaaat?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I-I thought I was having a heart attack.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was kidding about kidding.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whaaat?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay, I'm kidding about kidding about it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Phew⋯sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I was kidding about kidding about kidding.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um⋯are you for real?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. Just go see Mio![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lightning strike. Ayumi's gonna have a hard time at work again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The corridor's dark. It's night, so I guess it would be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I thought I heard a voice come from somewhere.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I was just hearing things.)[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]All right, well then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it's a voice⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems there's a voice coming from around that corner.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I'll listen from around the corner so they don't see me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A man and woman. It's not Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The man in front. It's Ryuuzouji. That's strange at this hour.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And that woman talking to Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is she? I think I know her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right! That woman's name is⋯ Kaori Asakura.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, that's the woman I saw at Geo Technics and outside my house.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she at school, talking to Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't make sense.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So that means I can proceed?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Things have been postponed⋯ However, it should still be at that place.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]My my, aren't you being vague.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It can't be helped, given the circumstances.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm just doing my job, so I won't ask for your reasons⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that the obligation of the mass media? Hmm, how commendable.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. The people have a right to know.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Plus, your name becomes more well known.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's inevitable that people who are good at their job become more well known. I'm not doing this for my own benefit.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I know. I'll consider it carefully.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thank you kindly, Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't just call out to them like this.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So, just what are your plans?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's not something you need to know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But that makes me more interested. It's not realistic for you to talk about economics.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If it's not for profit, then perhaps it's simply academic curiosity?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's best you don't go after it. For the both of us.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* I'll keep that in mind. By the way⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What will you do about him?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ah. He's a very ambitious young man.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Mhmmm, but without his cooperation, we won't achieve what we're trying to do.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, that means we can't treat him very poorly.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, as long as I can fulfill my duty to the people, my lips will remain sealed.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Plus your reward.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Of course. I'm a professional, so I don't work for free.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]All right then, we'll talk again if anything happens.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And one more thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It seems you've hired someone other than myself.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]And what is your concern with that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't want them getting in the way of my work.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There's nothing for you to worry about. I'm just having them follow Koudai's tracks.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A private detective?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing so serious. He's just a petty local investigator who specializes in backgrounds and affairs. You're in an altogether different class.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's my policy to not look down on any helping hand. He too can be useful.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Indeed⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh shit, they're coming this way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I better hide!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please don't see me, please don't see me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯why do I even need to hide in the first place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't done anything wrong! At least, not today⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I shouldn't have to sneak around like a criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, it wasn't exactly the situation to just pop out and say 「hello.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that lady⋯ I think her name's Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell were they talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh!!![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eek! Wh-Why are you so jumpy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Oh it's you, Mitsuki. Don't scare me like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why are you so jumpy? Wait, I know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, then what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're standing in the middle of the hallway, looking dead serious. So, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I uh⋯ Crane Technique![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What⋯are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, it's from an old movie. See how my arms and legs are placed? That's what's important⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look so dumbfounded.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Of course I'm dumbfounded! Anyway, I don't want to keep chatting in this dark hallway. Want to go to the lab?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That stuff between Ryuuzouji and Kaori⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Should I tell Mitsuki about it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're looking very serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I uh⋯ Crane Techni–[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You already did that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ How about the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just, stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then how about we toast to seeing each other again?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, okay.
 Oof.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm, okay. Oof.
[name]Mitsuki[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make that sound when you sit down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I know where I'm supposed to go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the only one here. It must be because remedial classes are over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. It's quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They must still be holding remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯ I mean, Mr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You missed class today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Skipping again, hmm? You're such a bad student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I volunteered as a substitute teacher, but you didn't attend class. It was so boring without you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, you're teaching remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't know that. If I'd known, I would've been there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You little liar. I didn't think you'd actually show up, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that trust between teacher and student is the root of education.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You dummy. Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We're still on for tonight, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. A rendezvous in the laboratory. Kinky.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Dummy. You better be there.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I need to talk to you. It's kind of serious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me⋯ You're pregnant![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haha⋯ Sorry. What did you want to talk about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Can I meet you at the laboratory this evening?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, a night in the laboratory? Can't wait to get me alone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Idiot, I'm trying to be serious here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha-What, really? Now you've got my heart pounding![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Good. I hope it explodes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Smart man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you wanna talk about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll tell you later⋯ It's about Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have to go now. Class is about to begin. I'm sure you won't attend, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, an understanding teacher is a magnificent thing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll see you tonight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why does Mitsuki want to talk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯about Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. Unlike the main hall, it's quiet up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. Where is Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard Yuuki isn't here either. Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. I'm boycotting the remedial classes for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I look for Ayumi first?[%p]
