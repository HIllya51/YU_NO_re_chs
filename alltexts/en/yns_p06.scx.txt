[name]Takuya[line]The main hall of the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's still students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main hall of the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no more students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back and forth. I'm starting to get tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think there's somewhere I'm supposed to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh, I came downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well I guess I did walk down the stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wasn't there somewhere I was supposed to go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came down to the first floor main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are more students left than I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the princess and her servant coming this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've gotta disappear.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey. Did you find the princess?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, and thanks to you she wasn't angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you finished in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ms. Takeda wasn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wasn't? Sounds like her.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It seems she's gone more often than she's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the princess?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Behind you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eep![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shriek whenever I encounter something beautiful.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, stop making that, 「I don't believe you」 face.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't believe you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That hurts. I'm always serious.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's the, 「I don't believe a word you say」 face.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't believe a word you say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And I'd like it if you would stop referring to me as “Princess”.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But don't they say that's the kind of thing you grow to like?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's with the, 「are you stupid?」 face?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you stupid?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's go, Yuuki. I feel like I'm getting infected by the stupidity.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yeah. Well, we'll be going, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio really is testy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Ms. Eriko doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She got down from the roof after that, and then where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Broadcaster[line]((Mr. Arima, Mr. Arima. Please come to the laboratory.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Arima⋯ Are they looking for me?[%p]
[name]Broadcaster[line]((Mr. Arima. Please come to the laboratory.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It couldn't be about that. Nah, it probably is about the other thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or could it be about that incident? No, I'm sure no one was watching me that time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it could be? It could be about so many things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory. That was on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
