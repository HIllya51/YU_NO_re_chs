[name]Takuya[line]It's starting to get dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can I meet that Kaori woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, Ryuuzouji's mansion is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is waiting for me there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I haven't seen Mitsuki at school yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. I'm starting to feel a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already evening. I haven't forgotten my promise with Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Summer remedial classes are going on right now. I can't wait until I have time off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. I think Ayumi's inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do, climb up there and pretend to be a cicada?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll say this: I don't like the plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. It holds those electric cables in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I explaining things like a dictionary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see it from here, but I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top one says 「Stop」 and the bottom one says 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's any space in the streets of Japan, these signs spring up like bamboo shoots.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's also true that looking at green makes you feel calm and relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these plants are here almost apologetically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they're not hurting anything so whatever, but I just don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's pretty bad to destroy nature only to turn around and say 「we love nature.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guardrail is tough enough to take a hit from a car.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course our tax dollars paid for it, so if anyone were to break it, they'd have to pay to fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I also pay consumer taxes, so that makes this guardrail partly mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This house is like an old samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A traditional Japanese house with lots of nature around it. What a place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sparrows in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sparrows like to rest up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're stretched all around like spider webs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was so hot during the day, but now it's almost cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The asphalt is cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really hot. I bet heat waves will come off it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The temperature of asphalt rises above 120 degrees at the peak of summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I'll be seeing mirages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school isn't very tall, but it's on a large property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd take a while to walk all the way around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this type of construction is called an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior design is actually pretty nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Sakaimachi Academy, the school I attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A safe name for a university, I guess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area is wide open. It feels so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember there being some kind of regulation that you can't build tall structures around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I have somewhere I need to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to Ryuuzouji's mansion, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be going to Ryuuzouji's mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if Mitsuki were there? Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stay calm. Just stay calm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going to Ryuuzouji's place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be going to Ryuuzouji's mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to see Ryuuzouji right now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is waiting for me there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like Mitsuki is around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Mitsuki is Ryuuzouji's secretary, so there's a good chance she's there, all things considered.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's place, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to Ryuuzouji's house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I just have to go to Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something bothers me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Pardon me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen that woman a lot recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she came from Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should go to Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll check out Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I have somewhere I need to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I could try going to Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That old lady was pretty creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's Ryuuzouji's house. I never knew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be a good idea to check it out. I should go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's not time to go there now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get inside the school. It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. The doors lock automatically at 6pm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll open from the inside, but not from out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember them warning us about that during the entrance ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get inside. It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's already closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll just make sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get inside. The school is closed at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't they close the front gates though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I was supposed to go meet Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm supposed to go to that room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in![%p]
