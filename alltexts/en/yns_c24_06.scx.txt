[name]Kaori[line]If you give me the [20th Document Page], I will help you clear the suspicion cast on Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I thought you had it with you⋯ Am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't agree with Toyotomi, so I think Ayumi really doesn't know where the document is.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I think it's not a bad deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I gonna do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I supposed to do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with a very slight grin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it okay to accept her proposal?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I don't have anything that will make you happy, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, too bad. I think we'd make good partners.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, but I did see the 20th document page though.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, Ayumi dropped her papers here and I helped her with them.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm, so there's a possibility Ayumi lost her papers here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm⋯ Got it. See you later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that all you need?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Can't you give it to me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you don't give it to me next time, then I'll assume you won't ever give it to me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What I want is the 20th document page.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong? I didn't get this wrong, did I?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And then I'll help you clear away the suspicions around Ayumi Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so shiny it looks like it might sparkle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her mid-length hair is beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's light illuminating it.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What, do you want to see?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh my, you're more calm than I thought. Hehe, you're more dependable than somebody else I know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're very direct, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, being so straightforward is good once in a while I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa. That's a pretty bold outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't keep myself from staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry, but I can't give you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never said I wanted it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she likes shiny stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't she get cold with her stomach exposed that much?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No use worrying about that, I suppose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling she's being provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's that kind of pose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are provocative hands, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful, but I don't know if I can trust her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The woman in front of me is Kaori Asakura.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it okay to accept her proposal?)[%p]
