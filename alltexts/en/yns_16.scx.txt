[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was just a trick of the light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mitsuki called from Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like she's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside the house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I should go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's good idea to call her from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hello, young man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji's mother.)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Did you get into the storehouse okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]There is something unusual in there. Be sure you find it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something unusual?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]If you can find it, you might find a secret from 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Just don't tell that boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which boy?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]My son. He's changed a bit, but he's still my son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you mean Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Check the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Check the storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's very creepy at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd better not see Ryuuzouji now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say that. Why are you wearing a white coat?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm on a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Walk?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't look at me like that. I walk sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. You walk.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What were you doing at the principal's mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was⋯studying. I study very hard.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Uh huh. And I'm the new prime minister.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're killing me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're young and healthy. You can take it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why were you talking to the principal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't talk to him. He wasn't home.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why are you here at his mansion, then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph. Fine. Anyway, your lips⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's lipstick on them. You should probably wipe it off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. That was, uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, it's so red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Ryuuzouji's mansion entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somehow, I'm drawn to it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because this place is haunted?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko was playing catch here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you believe that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's late. You should head on home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thanks for letting me know⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We talked for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi might be worried about me. I should go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Ryuuzouji's mansion, and it's as creepy as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no lights around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see why there's a rumor claiming this place is haunted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and his mother are the only two people living in this mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard his mother went crazy, but she's back to normal now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was crazy for a while, but she's better now. So it shouldn't be a big deal, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Mitsuki said it's a problem⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of which, that old lady said some weird stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was singing some kind of weird proverb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's enough to convince me she's crazy.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]If⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Hee hee.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ho ho⋯ What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-Nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't sneak up on me like that.)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just walking.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]It's too cold to enjoy walking today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]If⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Did you investigate what we talked about this afternoon?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Investigate what?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]So, it didn't even occur to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she getting at?)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Didn't you wonder?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wonder what?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Why this mansion is here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You see something?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]I can practically feel its 400 years of existence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you just say⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Oh, you didn't notice?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said something about it this afternoon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Apparently, this mansion was built 400 years ago⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she's just pointing out that it's a historic building⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I wondered if he was here⋯ Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Please forgive me. I didn't mean to⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Don't worry. It's cold outside. Why don't we get going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's nice to see you, Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just walking by and happened to see your mother.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Please forgive me. I really didn't mean to.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let's go inside. You'll get cold here.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Please forgive me. Forgive me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was keeping her here, sorry.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Yes, this man was keeping me here. Please, please forgive me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Okay, mother. Just go inside now.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hurry. Go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The old lady went inside.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Sorry about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She has dementia.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dementia?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. She suffering from Alzheimer's disease. It can cause a bit of social awkwardness. She says strange stuff sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It can't be helped. It's just part of being human.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]But it's strange. I was just thinking about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. Me too.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it a coincidence?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I don't know, but I've wanted to talk to you more than once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, me too.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, do you have some free time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plenty.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Would you like to come in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That went smoother than I thought it would.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's just as I expected, for now anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Though, it may be the same for him.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](At least now I can talk to Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a step forward.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This looks like a Japanese garden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The stream flowing through it is pretty amazing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's plenty of greenery. And I can see an unusual building over there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's all the way in the back.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's wrong? Are you curious about that building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The building on the far right is an old storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A storehouse?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, it's more like a shed. I hardly ever use it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The main building is on your right. It's a little better than the storehouse. Come.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm finally going into Ryuuzouji's house.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm a little nervous and practically shaking with excitement.)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this is the inside of the mansion.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so simple and humble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was expecting some kind of nouveau riche furnishings.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But there's almost nothing here.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This living room is so simple.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there a uh⋯reason?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]My mother tends to damage the furniture when she gets⋯nervous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Whatever isn't essential to the study has been removed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't much better than having no furniture at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe there's more in another room?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The other rooms are pretty much the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Do you want to come into the back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that's all right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I thought he was supposed to be rich.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This really reinforces the scholarly image he's got.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I've always wanted to talk to you like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, me too.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay. It all starts now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived at the front of the samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just like Mitsuki said: Ryuuzouji is kinda strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived at the front of the samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As usual, I feel cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've arrived at the front of the samurai mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Ryuuzouji's house. It's very dignified.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm? There's a woman coming down the stairs. It doesn't look like the old lady.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe! I run into you a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, you're Kaori, right?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You remembered me. I'm so happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes! I see you know him too. He's really a great man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you visiting him? I'm sorry to say he's not here, but his mother is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mother?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]He lives with his mother. I'm sure it's hard to manage this huge mansion alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, sorry, I tend to lose people because I talk a mile a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh yeah. Did you hear today's news?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hear⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should watch it. Also, we should meet up again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was she born with a big mouth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I couldn't get a word in edgewise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was talking about tonight's news. Is there something going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right in front of Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it's really scary at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've passed by here several times. This mansion is incredible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big pine tree in front, and the house is huge. Does the principal really make that kind of money?[%p]
