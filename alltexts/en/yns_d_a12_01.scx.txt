[name]Takuya[line]The door opened. We can move on ahead.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's check it out. We might find something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at the door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made of stone. It doesn't look like I can open it with my own strength.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh, you're so careless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's the issue here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this⋯door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rather, is it even really a door⋯?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lodged right in there. I don't think we can get it out.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. That might be for the best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It fits right in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect size.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is that really okay though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like part of a crown with a medal embedded in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing about it really stands out as strange.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Actually, everything is strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You said it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a carving of a crown on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A crown?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder what it could mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must have some kind of literal and figurative meaning.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A literal and figurative meaning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got that from my old man. When you have something in front of you that seems incomprehensible, there are two ways to interpret it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One is in a literal, physical way. In other words, there has to be a reason it's that way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Like if a patient visits the hospital a lot, they should keep a bed ready for them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not really, but sort of.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So it's driven by necessity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. If you look at it that way, it's not hard to interpret.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So what's the figurative meaning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's spiritual. It's based on some kind of reverence, fear, or old custom.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, it might be hard to understand using modern logic.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're saying⋯this crown is like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The crown does seem meaningful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just don't know what it means.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does this mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Honestly, I have no idea what it could possibly mean⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same as the one we saw in the other passage. Wait, no⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The pattern is slightly different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This one is like a crown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The one we saw before was more like a face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is a crown, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what this is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should look at it more closely⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is polished, and there's something carved into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. It kinda looks like a crown though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But⋯why would there be a crown carved onto it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what this is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should look at it more closely⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're taking it? But it was resting so neatly in place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but I feel like it's a good idea to take it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Black Medal][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Black Medal][color index="800000"].
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're taking it? But it was resting so neatly in place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but I feel like it's a good idea to take it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][White Medal][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][White Medal][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]The craggy rock was smoothed down, and a crown was carved into it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I suppose that makes it like a sculpture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what it's for though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole here. What could it be for?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's small. It looks about the size of a quarter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a rock⋯ Not really all that interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is soaking wet⋯ I should be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are jagged rocks jutting out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The surface is slightly wet⋯ Maybe water dripped down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is it me, or did it get much colder as soon as we got here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just you⋯ Maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The Black Medal is already embedded in it, so you can't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on. Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The White Medal is already embedded in it, so you can't do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on. Get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I tried putting the White Medal in⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's the perfect size for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it is the exact size⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I put the White Medal in. It fits perfectly.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, it fits right in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the White Medal was meant to go in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I put the White Medal in. It fits perfectly.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So these medals were meant to be put in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe. I'm not sure what its exact purpose is though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya! Look, the door![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It looks like we can get through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It went out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. It's dark⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are we going to do? What are we going to do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to panic. The light just went out. That's all.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You have a point⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be okay. This thing was half broken anyway.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Y-Yeah, sure thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't good. Mitsuki is on the verge of panicking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to get the job done as soon as possible.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this goes here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The standards are slightly off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on. I can't use that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, almost like it's telling us to go forward⋯ Let's move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The passage does seem to go on further ahead⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the matter, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have a bad feeling about this. Are you sure we should keeping moving forward?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in staying here, is there?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be fine. I'll go on ahead. You can follow behind me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, everything will be okay. If anything happens, I'll be here to protect you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay. Just be careful. There's no telling what might happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right, I'll go on ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Will I find Mio up ahead⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's dark⋯ I should be careful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, almost like it's telling us to go forward⋯ Let's move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The path goes even farther.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the matter, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have a bad feeling about this. Are you sure we should keeping moving forward?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in staying here, is there?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be fine. I'll go on ahead. You can follow behind me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling you, everything will be okay. If anything happens, I'll be here to protect you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay. Just be careful. There's no telling what might happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right, I'll go on ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Will I find Mio up ahead⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's dark⋯ I should be careful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could possibly be up ahead?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that noise?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, look out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's going on? It closed again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait a second. This door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn this thing is sturdy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are we going to do, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something. I'll try kicking it this time. Stay back.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah! All that did was hurt my foot. The door is tougher than it looks.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are we going to do? I don't want to die like this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on a second. I'm thinking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it. Did we do something wrong?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](We put in the two medals, and the door opened⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! I have no idea what's going on. I need to find a way to open this door.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I seriously doubt Mitsuki and I can open this with our strength alone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only we had something to break this thing down.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯ Do you have something on you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Something like what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something that'll break this door down.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Of course not. Why would I have something like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, I'm going to go on ahead and try to find something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing we can do on our own right now. Maybe if we had a hoe or a plow⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why would something like that be down here?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They were just examples. Anyway, if we can't break this thing down, we're done for.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No⋯ You're not going to leave me here, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, what are we going to do here? Have a staring contest?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's going to be fine. I'll be back, I promise. Just don't go anywhere![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯ Come back as soon as you can![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, the door is open. There's no need to go back.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right. Let's press on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go back⋯[%p]
