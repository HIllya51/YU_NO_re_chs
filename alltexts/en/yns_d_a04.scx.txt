[name]Takuya[line]There's only one path, so I don't think we'll get lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing more important than being careful as we proceed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, let's try to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's still going?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! How far do I have to go?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is this really the right way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no, I'm letting my fears show.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We've been walking in this passageway forever. Are you sure this is the right way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, there's no other way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be wrong.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You swear to god?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I swear to god.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That sounds like a lie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what do you want me to swear on?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look, you can go back if you really want to, Mitsuki. You should go wait with Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Way to go. I sure helped calm Mitsuki down⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can be such an ass sometimes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's nothing I can do in this situation though. Hell, I'd love to have some kind of reassurance too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I won't turn back. I'm going with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mitsuki is actually pretty tough.)[%p]
