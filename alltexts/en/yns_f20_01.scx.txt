[name]Takuya[line]This is room 1101. It's so gorgeous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Kaori?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a pretty high-class curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she hiding behind this curtain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dim lightbulb. You can't read books here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This lightbulb looks like a soccer ball.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the perfect way to set an⋯exciting mood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what mood is most exciting? Let's think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are two pillows lined up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can line up two pillows and put towel over it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then if I roll over in bed, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm still not sure if it's that kind of place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Two pillows⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's significant somehow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori is not hiding in the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would be funny if she were lying in bed just waiting for me to peel the covers back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a radio. I don't need to listen to that right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a radio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do family restaurants always seem to play the same song on loop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is sitting right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was Kaori sitting in this chair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing really to look at.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the typical table you see at hotels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a few cigarette butts still here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm? There are a few cigarette butts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone was here smoking these.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is hiding there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just an indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's hung up there. So either she didn't have a coat, or nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is hanging there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd have expected at least a coat to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a painting of an interior scene.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really understand this painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dim room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if no one's here, wouldn't it be pitch dark?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Kaori?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see her here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only place left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she's taking a shower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't peek. Only creeps do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll just check really quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a quick peek. That's all. I'm just checking to see if Kaori is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she happens to be there, well⋯ Then it's out of my hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not really a good excuse. It's crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try the bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing wrong. It's an ordinary bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's definitely not a cheap modular bathroom. I guess it's because this room is so expensive. There's a toilet right next to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are water droplets on the walls and floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone must have used it recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Kaori use it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, nobody's here. I should go back to the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's with that reaction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kaori! When did you come in?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I got here right as you walked into the bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I wasn't trying to sneak a peek.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯ N-Never mind.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I can tell you were thinking something bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't thinking anything! Let me tell you something, I–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You brought me a blue card, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't say you don't have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Blue card⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the card you need to access restricted areas in Geo Technics.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do anything with the toilet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's connected to the toilet and bathroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like going to the bathroom right now.[%p]
