[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at number 501. It's Kanna's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the door won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a steel door. It looks pretty tough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The nameplate says 「Hatano.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a plate with a name written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「Hatano.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I really going back in again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to talk to Kanna one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. It's locked, so I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, it was unlocked before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, am I going in again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Kanna at home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you there, Kanna? I'm coming in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door's locked, so I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's locked⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not here. Doing that won't help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Kanna went there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't she here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's answering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like she's not home now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a quiet apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I shouldn't judge, but it's a lot cleaner than I expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The superintendent must be attentive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With the management fee plus the maintenance fee, it must be super expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. It won't work unless I look from the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what you call a peephole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's designed to prevent you from seeing in from the outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just how it works.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light for the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light is illuminating the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's interior design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, I don't really understand art.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I don't know the value of paintings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Paintings hung in places like this are usually some innocuous landscape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And landscapes don't really excite anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means anything is okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling light⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light that's set in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lighting up the hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a plant, the same kind you see all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of those typical indoor plants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's kinda hard to breathe in here. Maybe because they're not sucking up enough carbon dioxide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's day now, time for photosynthesis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a decorative ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? There aren't any cigarette butts inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is just a decoration?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's an ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna doesn't smoke, does she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's probably a fire hose in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I press this, a siren will sound, then a firetruck, the police, and a bunch of busybodies will show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet even married couples would stop enjoying their 「quality time」 just to see what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I push it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a fire hose coiled up like a snake inside here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even saying it is kinda gross.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door I need isn't the one in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's no nameplate, does that mean that no one lives there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Kanna isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go outside.[%p]
