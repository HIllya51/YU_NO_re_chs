[name]Takuya[line]There's a person on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna?! It's Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you okay? Hey![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thank god. You're still alive.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I feel⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]So hot⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You feel hot?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The floor feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a fever. I can't leave her like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll bring her to the bed.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Someone⋯is trying to⋯do something on the coastline again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline? What?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]If I don't stop them, they'll be in danger.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey. You're the one in danger right now. You can't go anywhere like this.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Uhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you feel?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'm hot, and it's hard to move. I can't see very well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's really bad. Where is your bed?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Just there on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, to the right then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hup! You're pretty light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you really are hot. You're like a human furnace.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's your bed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm basically groping around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hup⋯ Hup⋯ Okay, here's the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ At least I got you in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you have any medicine that you're taking?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There should be something⋯in the medicine box⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The medicine box, right? Okay, now I have to find the medicine box and get you some medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Kanna's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is quite⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's way too dark to see well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this girl Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time to look at her thighs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her perfect, smooth, white legs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I really be staring at stuff like that right now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa⋯ Those legs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are they Kanna's legs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's on floor just past the entryway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Kanna, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Light flooded the room when I opened the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's bright from the light outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means it's pitch black in the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the room is pitch black now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could safely say it's pitch black in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind that. She's lying on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really a good idea to be looking there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a girl on the floor just past the entryway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to worry about her stomach right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With her shirt up that high, she's bound go get a stomachache.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's good her front is covered. What am I talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got to see my fill of her panties at the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So pale⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to look at that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I came to return something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now's not the time! Someone's on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
