[name]Takuya[line]She's not in the living room either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Ayumi though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Staying here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I need to look for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that doesn't matter right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around some more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a note from Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she's going out on an errand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a note from Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Takuya, I'm out running errands. I should be back soon.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She has work at this hour?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she's feeling okay. I even went out and got her some aspirin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. She's really busy lately so maybe she can't do anything about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After the lightning fiasco this afternoon, maybe she had to go into the office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But wait a second⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Ayumi say she didn't have work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't have work, but she's out on errands. Maybe someone called for her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Called for her⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried. Especially in her condition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If someone called for her, it had to be her company.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a direct light, but the slight dimness is the one drawback.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light. Indirect lighting has become popular recently, but I'm more practical than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's not one indirect light in the house. Hahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I boast about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtains. I don't think now is the time to be worrying about the curtains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The color of these curtains is beautiful. This must be Ayumi's choice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi waters these every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now it's just a keepsake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard can be so traditional about the strangest things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would a non-normal video tape look like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some kind of video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not an 「adults only」 one though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A family picture⋯ Tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A family picture⋯ That old bastard is photobombing a picture with Ayumi and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get annoyed just looking at it. I should ignore it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough with the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm more worried about Ayumi than what's on the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't that lady Kaori say I can see her if I turned on the TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just turn it on for now.[%p]
[name]Caster[line]((⋯ -as well, and News Presence will continue to report thoroughly on this incident.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that news anchor⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe it's her⋯ Kaori.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yep. She looks a bit different, but I'm sure that's the woman I saw in the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, so that woman is a newscaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Now let's talk with the one responsible for overseeing the construction.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((We're here with Head Facilitator Arima.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Head Facilitator Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman on the left is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's turn up the volume.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((So, Ms. Arima, you claim the company is blameless?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes. Normally, no one would ever expect lightning to strike coastal construction work, so there was no way to prepare for it at all.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is talking on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pressing her for information about the construction accident.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Yet lightning struck again today. And it may strike again in the future.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Well, that is⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Are you aware the public is demanding the company take responsibility?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((You are on this show to tell us exactly what caused this, not to make excuses.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're pretty much bullying her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in a real bind. Damn, that reporter is a bitch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure she's just another gossip hyena that calls herself a journalist.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((⋯and according to the weather map, there was extremely fair weather above the coastline then, so there shouldn't have been any lightning strikes.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes, I am aware.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Could it be that it wasn't a lightning strike and instead a mistake on the part of the construction company?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((No, that can't be. Lightning striking has nothing to do with whether the skies above are cloudy or clear.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((What do you mean?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((There are cases when lightning strikes from clouds up to six miles away.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((So lightning doesn't always strike directly below where it formed.))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Yes.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Then why is it that in the span of just a few weeks, there have been three recorded lightning strikes in the same area?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((W-We're⋯ Looking into that right now.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Why don't you wait to resume construction till after you find out what's causing it?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((W-Well⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Despite not knowing the cause of these lightning strikes, you won't stop the construction. Why is that?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Don't you think it's disrespectful to those who lost family members to the accident?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((Of course we do⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Not too talkative anymore, I see. Why don't we change the subject then?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((What about the rumors saying some kind of deal is going down between upper management at Geo Technics and the local government administration?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((That's a baseless rumor.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Is it, really?))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]((It really is⋯ I think.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((But, Head Facilitator Arima, you're⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, this lady Kaori is such a bitch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is having a lot of trouble in the studio right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I met that lady Kaori at the park earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is she on TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if she went directly to the TV station after seeing me, it still wouldn't be possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'm hum![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, it's coming from the entrance.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'm hum![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hum⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sounds like Ayumi. Yeah it's Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, so it was a pre-taped segment on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means Kaori must have come to Meiunji Park after recording that.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Heeey, Takuya are you here? Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh, something seems strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go to the entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's on right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The popular TV show News Presence isn't on right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Television, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Ayumi said she'd be going to the TV station around seven.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's seven o'clock right now, maybe there's something on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just some lame variety shows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The popular TV show News Presence isn't on right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It starts at nine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Staring at the TV won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A needlessly large TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No reason to watch the TV now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A useless TV that plays nothing but local channels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I keep seeing news about Geo Technics being criticized on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure there's no end to Ayumi's anxiety.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It smells like Ayumi a little bit. *sniff* Hahhh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a soft couch. I'm sleepy just sitting on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I shouldn't sit down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These cushions are so nice and soft.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi always sits on these⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And once she leaves, I bury my face in them. I love it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That just makes me a weirdo though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to sit down now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair I can use to sit at the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At Ayumi's height, her toes can barely touch the ground sitting on this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's always swinging her feet in the air like a little kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't cook, so this is no use to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can do is spin it atop a chopstick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plates and bowls for food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi puts the food she cooks on these.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not very thirsty, so I'll just leave it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd love to be drinking with Ayumi, just the two of us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But she only sees me as her stepson.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge looks empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anything is inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh my god![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll buy juice next time I'm out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like I'm on my period, so no need to have a staring contest with the calendar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still so hot this season. I hope it cools down soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Although I'll probably be hoping it warms up once it starts getting really cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light. No need to turn it on now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A light for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fluorescent lights aren't good for places where you eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes your food look unappetizing. Yellow lighting is better.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know art too well, so I should leave this alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is some kind of ethnic thing my old man brought home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be some kind of art piece. I don't know anything about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the light to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The living room light isn't exactly dim, so I guess this is just for design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi likes green. She doesn't like sticky green stuff though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Neither do I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi likes this kind of stuff. She really likes green, I know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember one time when I handed her some green slime. She let out a nice scream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a pretty steep staircase. Going up to the second floor is tiring.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I said that, Ayumi told me I sounded like an old man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a spiral staircase.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One time, I tumbled down these steps like a soccer ball.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rolled right into the china cabinet, and all the dishes crashed down on top of me. The broken pieces really cut me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi was laughing pretty hard until she saw how badly I was hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't slide around though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hardwood floor. It's nice and cool on my bare feet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be too cold to stand on in the winter though. What a selfish floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to order delivery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at the phone makes me want to order food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cordless handset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We get lots of prank phone calls lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who would do such a thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no use for the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The counter is for eating and drinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi loves shopping for plates and pans and stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's quite a bit piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One time, I tumbled down these steps like a soccer ball. I rolled right into the china cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the dishes crashed down on top of me, and the broken pieces really cut me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the stairs and the china cabinet remind me of that day⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's the use of standing in the living room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the living room won't do anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to just leave her alone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt she'd go out in her condition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I don't have any options but to get some headache medicine from the store.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, Ayumi is in the foyer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seemed a bit off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayu⋯mi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, you're late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, why are you sitting in the foyer?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Because I like sitting in the foyer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The cool floor feels so good on my butt⋯ Hehehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, what are you just standing there for⋯huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's drunk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's gotten into her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Staying here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to look for Ayumi. Let's go outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to my room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't remember any headache medicine being in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi is in the foyer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my room. There, the foyer is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to my room, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's study. I guess I could go check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no medicine in the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well. Not much I can do about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't in the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All of the documents were given to Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means they aren't here, but should I still go in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man's study. For some reason, nothing is left in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's definitely not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She drank too much and now has a killer hangover. I need to go buy some medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is in the foyer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems strange. I should hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no real reason for me to go there.[%p]
