[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard the briefing went a little awry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look any different than normal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where they held the briefing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surprisingly dark. I wish it were brighter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It will probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light post. It'll probably light up at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's daytime now, so the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lights are shining. It looks like bugs are gathering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's relatively high, and also those are barbed wires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks to be used as a guard fence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it surrounds the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barbed wires at the top of the wall, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's charged with a high-voltage current like in the movies, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't look at it too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of the light post, I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps it is wired in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯ Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics Japan Geological Engineering Laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can climb over it easily, but that might cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it's easy to climb over, that's why I should be cautious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I try going over it, they might shoot me with a laser or something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I could easily go over this railway crossing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But as soon I try going over it, the guards will jump on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nobody's here. But is that okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the guard house. I heard they take care of the security inside, but no one's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it okay to leave the guard house empty?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's the security guard?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯hi.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're Chief Arima's son, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The explanatory meeting⋯the briefing. Was it held here?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yeah, we already cleaned up the signs and other garbage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I hear it was a big mess. Looks like they really gave it to Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why were they going after Ayumi? I'd understand if they were angry at the company.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, it was probably because she took responsibility for the company. She is the person in charge, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]There were some bad people there. They threw eggs at her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, I guess I understand that the family members of the people who died were angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why didn't you stop them?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Morally, I wanted to protect her. But under no circumstances was I to get involved in today's briefing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I don't know. My job is to guard the front gate, so I wasn't told the reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I just follow the orders I'm given. But if there was a threat to Chief Arima's life, of course I would've helped her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did the company tell you that you weren't to get involved with the briefing?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yeah, you could take it to mean that I was supposed to leave everything to Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Seems a little off to me.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I have to go take care of the security inside now, too, so the guard house will be empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Don't hang around here too much. I've been giving you a pass since you're the chief's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Ayumi had a hard time today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big antenna⋯ I don't think it's for watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big parabolic antenna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they are doing satellite communication with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dome. But I don't know what they use this for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dome like a planetarium attached to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what they use it for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can hear noises from inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like my school, the building height doesn't exceed four stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are ordinances that state the maximum height of buildings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I climb up here, I can probably get to the entrance of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope⋯ I thought I nearly died climbing all the way here, and there's still more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I get to the company building, I'm gonna pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like some kind of directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where I found the 20th page of the document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't find anything in a shrub⋯ Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some difficult mathematical equations and graphs written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's numbered 「20」 at the bottom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the 20th page of a document.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would a document be in the shrub?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][20th Document Page][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the bushes won't make anything come out of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feels nice with lots of green in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is filled with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think these plants are native to around here⋯still, at least the architect has good taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really matches the building in a nice way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring at the sky won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a clear blue sky. If I keep looking at it, I'll end up having neck pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could just disappear into the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is already inside Geo Technics property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No good. I can't just walk in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I can't just walk inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go inside without permission, I'd cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there is something special that I have to do, it's a different story.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, staying here won't help at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
