[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a damaged storehouse here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls are really damaged.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so much creepier at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This storehouse is half destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a copse of trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the greenery around here is from the copse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this atmosphere, it's no wonder people talk about this place being cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like something could pop out at me any second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door to the storehouse is open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt Mitsuki is inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll just go inside for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't get a key, I won't be able to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need the key to the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I botched it. The only thing I can do is use the map and get the key from somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't be able to get inside as long as I don't have the key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go back though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, where can I get this key?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be a different story if I had a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's supposed to be a well over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim, so I'd better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
