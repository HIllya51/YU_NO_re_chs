[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surprisingly dark. I wish it were brighter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lights are shining. It looks like bugs are gathering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's relatively high, and also those are barbed wires.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks to be used as a guard fence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it surrounds the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are barbed wires at the top of the wall, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's charged with a high-voltage current like in the movies, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't look at it too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of the light post, I think.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps it is wired in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says⋯ Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geological Engineering Laboratory, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says, 「Geo Technics Japan Geological Engineering Laboratory.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can climb over it, but there's a guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need to go inside if Ayumi isn't there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it's easy to climb over, that's why I should be cautious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I try going over it, they might shoot me with a laser or something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like I could easily go over this railway crossing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But as soon I try going over it, the guards will jump on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are there any guards now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like there is a female guard inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The guard is sitting deeply in the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I couldn't see her from over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I could possibly go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeeeey, heeeey⋯[%p]
⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one? I don't think so, but no one is answering me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is where the guards stay overnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big antenna⋯ I don't think it's for watching TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big parabolic antenna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they are doing satellite communication with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dome. But I don't know what they use this for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a dome like a planetarium attached to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what they use it for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like my school, the building height doesn't exceed four stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are ordinances that state the maximum height of buildings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi probably works in that building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I climb up here, I can probably get to the entrance of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a slope⋯ I thought I nearly died climbing all the way here, and there's still more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As soon as I get to the company building, I'm gonna pass out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like some kind of directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably a map of this property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Feels nice with lots of green in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is filled with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think these plants are native to around here⋯still, at least the architect has good taste.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really matches the building in a nice way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring at the sky won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could just disappear into the dark sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is already inside Geo Technics property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't enter even if I'm her immediate family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it seems like Ayumi isn't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, yeah⋯but⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, you over there. What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhh.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]This is company owned private property. What are you here for, at this hour?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]If you don't have any business, you should go home, kiddo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make fun of me. I'm a student.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Not a 「kiddo.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]May I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯ I mean, my stepmother works for this company. Her name is Ayumi Arima.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]What? The head facilitator?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Uh-huh⋯hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're quite big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Where?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm talking about your height, obviously. I didn't know Mrs. Arima had a son as old as you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, even putting aside the fact that she's my stepmother, Ayumi does make herself look young.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She could look my age.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]So what do you need at this hour of the night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came to see Ayumi⋯my mother.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That's strange. She went home already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Is she still working? Well, she works hard, so that could possibly be the case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you check?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]This is the only entrance and exit. So if she walks in or out, I'd know for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh well. I'll go check.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just want to know if Ayumi is okay or not.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know if she is okay with the way Ryuuzouji was acting.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please stay safe.)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I knew she's not here.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Mrs. Arima went home a while ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see. How about Ayumi's office?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I'm sorry but I can't let you in here, even if you're her immediate family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]That's company policy. I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]She probably is home already. You should hurry home now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like Ayumi isn't here at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like the guard isn't here, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if I go in without permission, it might cause trouble for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, this isn't the time to be taking things slowly⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop. I know the guard will jump on me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi was telling me that the security here is really tight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go in without permission, I don't know what'll happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, Ayumi wasn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means, staying here like this won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's wait a little bit more before going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just got here, I can't go home without any progress.[%p]
