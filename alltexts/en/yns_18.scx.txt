[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I took the long way, but I can get to the school from the stairs on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see Mitsuki as soon as I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's gonna happen with the construction now.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hi Kanna. What are you doing at the ocean so late?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I am just⋯watching the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This late at night?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Soon⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's soon?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beach is quiet. Looks like no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard there was a lightning strike here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a strong sense of panic in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard there was a lightning strike here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the construction workers have gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. All the construction workers have gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which reminds me, I feel like I had plans this evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. Still under construction, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's Ryuuzouji over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's talking to a construction worker.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, he's coming this way.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, hello Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯hi.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I thought you had remedial classes to attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're finished.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, Ichijou was very eager to be teaching her remedial classes. How was her lecture?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Very easy to understand. I think she's an excellent lecturer. Well, please keep in mind that those are the words of a not-so-great student.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Don't be modest. You're Koudai's son. When your father was in good health, your marks were actually quite good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's checked up on me.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Construction will also start on our school soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What construction? I thought it was just a geological survey.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There's more of a relationship between the two than you'd think. I can't say there will be no effect on the school when the bedrock is dug into for the geological survey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess any event can have unexpected effects.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Always best to be prepared. Now then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'd like to speak to you when we have the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]How about a discussion on Koudai's research?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard you took the old man's research papers.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. It was a collaborative research between Koudai and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you researching?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll tell you some other time. Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me some other time, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd really like to have a sit down with Ryuuzouji, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know which Ryuuzouji, though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. Still under construction, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. What now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's construction going on, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People, trucks, and fences. That's definitely a construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only place I can think of to observe the construction⋯ So where is Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey you! You can't just walk around here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it's that guy.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen, you can't come in here without my permission as the construction director⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, his name was Toyotomi or something. Ayumi's number one stalker.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I've seen you before. Are you a student?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, this is a restricted area, so I can't have you just walking in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came to see Ayumi. Is she here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hrrmm, that's right you were⋯yes, the chief's distant relative.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm her son.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Right, her adopted son as a single, unmarried mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is married, and I'm not adopted. I'm her stepson.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I see, tsk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with this guy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nighttime, so it doesn't look like they're working.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. Where did Ryuuzouji go with that gun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's also gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's that girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still can't believe she disappeared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
