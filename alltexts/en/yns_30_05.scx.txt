[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck was Mitsuki doing here?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯ Where are you, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Mitsuki's voice⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, Takuya, where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯ I should go to Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't. If I could get down there, I might be able to get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can I get down there though? I doubt I could climb down the walls of the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, I wish I had a rope or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, Mitsuki said something before. She found pieces of the diary around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means that might be a piece of the diary too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*groan*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant* I can't reach it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rock isn't in that part.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this? There's a hole here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like the rock fell out right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't be looking at that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There, in the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rocks are piled up near the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I drop a pebble down it, I might be able to tell how deep it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I have other things to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark back there. Mitsuki said it was all dried up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how deep it is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I can just get down there, I might be able to get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't be able to without a rope or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be the dried up well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like anything is in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some kind of paper. Something is written on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she said something about finding pieces of the diary here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way they could have been in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First off, Mitsuki said it was all dried up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the surface of the water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty deep too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like someone piled up some rocks to make a well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wells are really old fashioned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks old too. Seems like it's been years since someone used it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of rocks piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's made like a pretty traditional well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks really heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a pretty heavy stone disc.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet it was used as the cap to the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say it looks barren, but it actually looks more overgrown than anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's lots of vegetation growing around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to the storehouse entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
