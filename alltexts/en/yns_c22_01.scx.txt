[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place must have some kind of power to attract people to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet⋯ Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the foot of Triangle Mountain is the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obviously Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Sword Cape. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna was placing down some flowers⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Sword Cape. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet. All I can hear is the sound of the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is where it all started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some kind of letters. No need to read them now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's said that they were written approximately 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be reading this now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That girl was on the ground here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was she, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I saw a bag that's probably Mio's behind here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where's Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio was investigating this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it could be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is right there, as quiet as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is right there, as quiet as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and Ayumi⋯ We were facing off at the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why isn't anyone here now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it all a dream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji drew a gun, and I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Sword Cape. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do they call it the shrine? Just take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has a strangely solemn air to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
