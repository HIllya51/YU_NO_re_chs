[name]Takuya[line]Where did Celes go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in thinking about it. Let's just prepare the drinking water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The cistern was destroyed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Celes do this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes isn't here. Maybe she stormed outside in her anger.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes isn't here. Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was just here a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's better than making her upset now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone already cleaned up the food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes must have cleaned up before she left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wooden water tank is broken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is the meaning of this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There should be plenty of drinking water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry up and get ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's water in the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No such luxury as running water in this world. Most of our water is rain water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't checked out the river water thoroughly yet, so we haven't tried drinking it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. What about the water tank outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, we need to prepare, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're not ready to go out into the desert yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This has nothing to do with the bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wooden water tank is outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left to do in the bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to focus on getting prepared now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came from there. Oh well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've already gotten everything ready in the bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's hurry up and get everything ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get water from this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was water here before, but it's all gone now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. There's a wooden tank to store rain water outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Forget food. If we don't have water then we'll shrivel up in a single day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure there's a week's worth of water in the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's broken. The water is gone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could this happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
