[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like striking heavy timber.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like metal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has such delicate curves. It's nothing like iron.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a bull's horns. What is this?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has a hard metallic luster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels soft and smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never seen something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be used for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if this is the strange thing Ms. Eriko mentioned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That looks strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what you would use this for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never seen something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's metallic, but it feels smooth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks light, but heavy at the same time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a piece on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's a piece of that strange thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The soil.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The storehouse has a dirt floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has an unusual soil smell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a metal door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it doesn't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a metal door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a wall of the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sinking into the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if it's heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sinking into the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it heavy, or did it just suddenly slam into the ground?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some unusual protrusions inside the hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like a switch, but it's squishy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there a hole in it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it a machine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lamps and switches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's soft and squishy. Is it really a machine?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has a hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a person can fit in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll push it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh, wait a minute![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah! What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, the Reflector is resonating! What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's vibrating! What the hell?![%p]
[name]Eriko's Voice[line]((Are you here? Answer me!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯is she on the other side of this door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, I'm here! I'm on the other side of this door![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((The door is welded shut. I can't open it! How about from there?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn! There's no key! I can't get it open![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((The potential value of the event element is abnormal. What did you do?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What did I do? I just touched it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((The Reynolds number exceeds 10 to the third power. Once it becomes unstable, it'll be impossible to control. Okay. Listen to me!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((You're going to be pushed to another causal law due to the snap-through phenomenon.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The snap what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((The event is jumping and buckling.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That doesn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((That's because there's something making you change causality.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is causing me to change it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((You should already have some clue what it is. Think for yourself!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that's just unreasonable![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Whoa![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((Okay, listen.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am listening![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((But it also means it's possible we can come back here.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((From now on, you will move to the event expression area outside the Neumann boundary. However, the destination is not fixed.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]((That's in⋯parallel⋯))[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm tempted to push it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of weird protrusions inside the hole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it okay to push this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Think hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aahh, wait a minute![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah! What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]

[name]Eriko[line]((The potential energy of the event element is abnormal. What did you do?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-What did I do? I just touched it.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
