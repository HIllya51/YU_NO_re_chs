Don't take the Stone
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll do it.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Attaboy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, it's supposed to be sturdy glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll break the glass⋯ You should stand back, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe⋯ Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Hypersense Stone][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Hypersense Stone][color index="800000"].
[name]Kaori[line]That seemed a little brash.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now, will you give that to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What? You've come this far. You don't need it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You come this far⋯ All right, fine. I'll do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm wrapping my hand in a handkerchief. Stand back a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, okay, but what's the handkerchief for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]For this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That was rather violent⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heh, I guess so. I didn't have a choice if I wanted to get the stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We have the stone. Now we just have to get away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't gotten what I came for yet.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's fine, I got what I came for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hypothetically speaking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're a complete outsider to Geo Technics. On top of that, you're Chief Arima's stepson.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you stayed behind, what would the security guards think when they found you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Maybe they'll think you're the perpetrator and Ayumi orchestrated the whole thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're not as sharp as I thought. It looks like you don't have enough acting ability to be my partner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you want to be with me, you need more foresight, kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]See ya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ W-Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't let Kaori escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After her![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ What's going on?![%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((There's an intruder in Section D12. Security, please respond directly to Section D12.))[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((I repeat, there is an intruder in Section D12.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way, is this Section D12⋯?[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((Security, seal off the entrance immediately.))[%p]
[name]Announcement[line]((I repeat. Security, seal off the entrance immediately.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a lot of noise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this rate, I'll get caught in no time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the entrance is already sealed off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which way should I go?[%p]
