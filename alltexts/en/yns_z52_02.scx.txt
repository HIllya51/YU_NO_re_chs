[name]Takuya[line]It's a hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm carrying stuff, so I should return home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's return home soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The weather is perfect today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should get back to the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ The weather really is perfect, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me want to lay down and roll around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees grow thick⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wide forest continues on the left side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are several forests all around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A seemingly endless desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was called the Rafaelo Desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposedly as hot as hell itself. I don't have any business going there right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see our house all the way back there, to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the right. That small house is ours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take a nap later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aww, I really want to take a nap on that grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Later. I need to go back to the house first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I really be climbing a tree?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I? Some kind of monkey?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't sleep up in a tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, back to the house![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, back to the woods?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I certainly have a bad habit of dawdling⋯*sigh*[%p]
