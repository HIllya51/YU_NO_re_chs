[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki went to Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told me to wait here, but what am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯ Where are you, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's Mitsuki's voice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This storehouse is half destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not particularly strange. It's just a wreck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's much larger than usual, which means it takes a lot more work to maintain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's just as Ryuuzouji said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He lives alone with his mother, so I guess it's only natural things ended up this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls are really damaged.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one has done any maintenance on this storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a copse of trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the greenery around here is from the copse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is so clear, it makes me want to do a rain dance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And they say lightning is striking down at the coastline. How strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this atmosphere, it's no wonder people talk about this place being cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like something could pop out at me any second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go inside again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might run into Ryuuzouji if I go inside now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should wait a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what if I run into Ryuuzouji in there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Mitsuki tell me to stay put?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, she did say a well was over that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious. Why don't I go check it out?[%p]
