[name]Takuya[line]It'll be a long trip. I better prepare for it or I might die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I need to get ready, not look around the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to say farewell to this room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even so, the only time I slept here was last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was mostly used by Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to stare at the bed like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bed I slept in last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up until a week ago, a female knight named Illia slept here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes has slept in this bed all week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I erased her scent last night by sleeping there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm all ready. Or am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to get water from the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm leaving the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm all ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Shouldn't we get ready?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need a lot of provisions to go into the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already got the food ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Enough for one week sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The food around here is mostly nuts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know which nuts I can eat thanks to Illia's food reserves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already got the food ready.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These clothes should be okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Clothes are important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to wrap myself from head to toe in cloth to avoid the sunlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if it's so hot, why would I wrap myself up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I stay out in the sun too long, I'll get burnt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This should protect me from that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get water ready in the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Water is the most important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be all right if I don't eat for a day or two, but even a day without water will severely dehydrate me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This world doesn't have anything convenient to put this in, like a plastic bottle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll have to put it in a waterskin before I go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's water in the kitchen sink. I should gather that up.[%p]
