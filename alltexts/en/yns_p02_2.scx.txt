[name]Takuya[line]I can hear talking coming from Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear talking coming from Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her room is the door on the left next to the cupboard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then there's my room and my father's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't matter now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The switch is already off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Ayumi came home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does the counter have to do with Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm. Something's up with Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm hungry. This sucks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She could have at least told me she was home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's room is past the cupboard on the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't fight on an empty stomach. I'll get her to make me some food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Listen to me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crap!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]As I said before, there is no problem with the construction on our end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](S-She was changing?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap. I saw her changing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's wearing nothing but her underwear.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was pretty tasteful underwear too, sexy but subtle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](God, I sound like a pervert.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's my stepmother. I shouldn't be getting worked up like this.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I've told you repeatedly that isn't the case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a pretty intense conversation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who she's talking to.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ Yes⋯ That isn't a problem.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]My opinion, as the one responsible for all of this, is that we should halt construction.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Even if it means pushing back the deadline, it's best to discover the cause quickly.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's about the construction on the coastline.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ayumi is in charge of that project.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must be talking to someone from her company. She looks stressed.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. That's right. Yes, that is my opinion as head of this project.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, that isn't what I meant at all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa! Did she see me?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]N-No⋯ It was something here⋯ Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I, uh⋯ I'm not a peeping tom.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, really, it's nothing. I'm sorry I shouted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should go back to the living room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I so upset about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It wasn't like I was trying to watch her change or anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She just happened to be changing when I went to talk to her. It was out of my control.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ah! Who am I justifying myself to?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's the type of underwear Ayumi prefers⋯ Oh, stop it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never heard her use that tone before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction on the coastline must have something to do with the lightning incident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought lightning would be considered a natural disaster. Why would anyone be held responsible for that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's a complaint about safe working conditions or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problems are just stacking up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is gonna burn out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. I'm starving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My kingdom for a beef bowl. If I don't find something to eat, I'm gonna die.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew! You caught me at a really bad time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, I⋯ I don't care that you were walking around in your underwear.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What? What are you talking about? I meant the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Oh, y-yeah. I've never heard you like that before.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry I was so late today. Did you eat dinner?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, not really. I thought about ordering a bunch of beef bowls, but it gave me heartburn.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ha! Well, that's really weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll give back the money you left for dinner.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can keep it. So do you want to eat now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure. I feel like I could eat ten beef bowls.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I think there's something in the refrigerator I can throw together. Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's fine. Thanks![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't guarantee it'll be any good though. Haha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything you make tastes good, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay, hang on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I found some food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Any longer, and I might have starved to death.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's right, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I forgot to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You should knock before you enter a woman's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You saw me, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No! I don't know what you're talking about! I've never seen you in your underwear in my life![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's fine. Just remember, if you do it again, I'll have to punish you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, maybe I want to be punished⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*munch munch* *gulp*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you sigh like that?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It looks like you were really hungry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was really hungry.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You didn't even chew long enough to taste it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's not true. I'm totally savoring every bi–gckk![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here. Have some water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp* Ahh⋯ This water just saved my life![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
