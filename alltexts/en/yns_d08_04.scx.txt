[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry up and get the book Mio borrowed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was the title of that book Mio borrowed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm much more interested in the girl above the numbers though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Mio's book is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A teacher must have drawn this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some weird drawing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I turn this, the door will open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not really something that needs explaining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A doorknob. Not a door Bob.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's Bob?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. I hope it doesn't place me under arrest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. The teachers must be using it to drink stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A completely empty fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The book I'm looking for⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt it's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lamp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lamp that you can bend and turn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course there's no book there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot of stuff here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which one is the book Mio borrowed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this document?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A Newspaper Read Upside Down is Still a Newspaper.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot of stuff here, but nothing that looks like Mio's book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, this thing looks like a phonebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「An Introduction to History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like it would be around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that title again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A Book of Hard to Understand History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A memo board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are notes and schedules on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks messy, but these things are pretty convenient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, this notebook isn't really a book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A regular analog clock. I can hear the seconds tick by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an analog clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's weird to see, considering how everything is digitized nowadays.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are even clocks that have digital needles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, look at the time. Mio is waiting in the caf⑮.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to hurry up and look around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A chair. I prefer sitting in a chariot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The teachers use these chairs, I bet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to sit down now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The books are stacked up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of books and papers here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯oh, here it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The title is⋯「Legacy.」 This is it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nice, I got the book. Now all I have to do is go back to the caf⑮, 「EVENING.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should get outside quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I remember this afternoon⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio was sitting at the table like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a regular, fluorescent light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fluorescent light for the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are shut to block the setting sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The setting sun shines right in this room. That's why the blinds are always shut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is always closed, whether it's during the day or night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be cool if money came falling down while I stared at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's going to fall down so I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A vent⋯for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. I better not hold a lighter up to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. It sprays out water if a fire breaks out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't think it's too bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, who's that stud in the mirror?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last time I said that, Mitsuki kept asking me, 「Where?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was here with Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I can't even look at her straight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It may be a locker, but I don't know if I'm locked and loaded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This locker is deeper than it looks. Seems big enough for two people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bookshelf filled with specialized books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but specialized books in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at it makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This room sure is a mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the teachers hang out, so they could keep it a little cleaner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
