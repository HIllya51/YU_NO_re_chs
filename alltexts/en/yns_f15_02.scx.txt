[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think of it, she was saying something about the beach when she collapsed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me she went out in her condition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't pass her on the way over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's had my interest for a minute. What's that white noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just in my head?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be my imagination. I really thought I heard something though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bare fluorescent light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something sinister about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fluorescent light is bare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no curtains on the windows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pitch black outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't notice this because I was looking for medicine, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯there aren't even curtains in this apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing stopping you from peeping in⋯except that it's on the fifth floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The AC won't turn on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's broken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't turn on. Is it broken?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an air conditioner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember there being a lot of people catching cold from too much AC in the summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not on right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't much medicine in this medicine box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just stomach medicine, bandages, and some pain relief patches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medicine box. Not much inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's either not used at all, or all used up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is probably where she eats.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's really nothing there though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the table but the medicine box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal table. Nothing out of place about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's trash inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be using it as a trash can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cardboard box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I shouldn't rummage through her cardboard boxes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside is a kitchen knife and a pot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really okay to open this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside besides a kitchen knife and a pot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a simple kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Empty cans⋯not a drop inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would empty cans be discarded here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's certainly not a single guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it makes it seem more like someone actually lives in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some empty cans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot of soda cans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be where she cooks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a simple kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are vegetables and milk inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is what Kanna eats.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me keep opening it. Opening the fridge will actually make the room hotter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Open the fridge in someone else's kitchen without permission?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if Kanna were inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Vegetables from the convenience store and one carton of milk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm assuming the stuff Kanna eats is in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A small fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, refrigerator storage is measured in liters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it matters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A small fridge for one person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This bottle looks like it had alcohol in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alcohol?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me that old alcoholic was here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone gets the urge to drink some times, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's odd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This bottle is⋯whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's alcohol.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Kanna was drinking this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one cup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just one cup on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter where I look, the best word to describe this place is 「simple.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's something in this bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty old. You can feel its age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture of two girls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, one of the girls is Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to believe she could smile like that knowing how she is now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's usually pretty stern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, I bet she'd get mad at me for saying that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The girl next to her is a bit older. She's quite pretty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there's something written on the back of the picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「With the one I love most」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The one she loves most?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, this isn't the time to be looking at pictures.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check out the bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is that old bastard's bankbook here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are there monthly deposits, and why does Kanna have it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyways, I better put this back where I found it. It doesn't feel good going through this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she'll know something about my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about my old man, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that bastard is alive, he won't get off easy![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knowing him, I'd say he might be pretty close by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I hear something just now?[%p]
*whimper*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A voice⋯it's someone's voice. I really heard it this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is someone there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be that old bastard?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯ Where could that noise be coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯the deposits stopped two months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see, my old man went missing two months ago and was confirmed dead a month later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means this bank account was getting deposits right up until he disappeared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The question is why would Kanna have my old man's bankbook?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could Kanna be his love child?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's actually so plausible it makes me scared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, a love child wouldn't be that bad. What if that old bastard was keeping her as his mistress?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so plausible it actually scares me. Damn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If that were the case, I wouldn't know how to apologize to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, Kanna. I'm taking a look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Name: Koudai Arima, Nishiwaki Bank, Sakaimachi Branch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it really does belong to the old bastard⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A savings account.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Deposits are being made periodically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About 300,000 yen a month. Where did he get that kind of money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my old man's bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would something of my dad's show up here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And in Kanna's apartment, of all places.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there's something on top of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the very edge of it. It looks like a notebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I shouldn't be doing this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm basically tearing apart someone's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That isn't stopping me from doing it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hup! Man, that's high. It's like someone was hiding it up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hiding it⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hup! Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't good. I never intended on digging through something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't believe this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That can't be possible⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The name on it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「Koudai Arima」!
[name]Takuya[line]Koudai Arima⋯ Could it be my old man?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would Kanna have a bankbook with my dad's name on it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, let's not jump to conclusions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a possibility someone else could have the same exact name as him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Koudai Arima isn't that common of a name, though. My old man was the only person I ever knew with that name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But then why would this bankbook be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look into this more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see up that far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't anything of particular interest inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To put it simply, there's nothing there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There might be something above it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt there's anything there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cupboard for storage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be stored in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's for storing things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is sleeping right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the bed Kanna was just sleeping in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little damp from her sweat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to think a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like going to the bathroom right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Probably leads to the bathroom or somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This room is too plain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I could call a girl's accessory around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Kanna's apartment, apparently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I say apparently because I can hardly believe it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she have any family?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she live by herself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a simple apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does a girl really live here?[%p]
