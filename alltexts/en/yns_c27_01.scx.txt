[name]Takuya[line]I'm back at the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was supposed to meet Yuuki here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already really dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Yuuki searching?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Heights⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night in the park⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard Toyotomi is in the park in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they went into Meiunji Park down there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That place is a popular date spot at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So if Toyotomi went in there with two other men⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The three of them were about to get kinky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't expect him to swing that way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's Heights. You can see the whole town from this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio and Yuuki aren't in the utility pole⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry. I can't keep calm if I don't talk to myself like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a cicada?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She wouldn't have climbed the utility pole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. I didn't hear the scream coming from the utility pole.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. I shouldn't be looking at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course they're not over there. She left a note behind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's been gone for almost a week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was she planning to go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house is the perfect picture of a huge mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear her father is the mayor of this city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Politicians make a lot of money.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Princess Shimazu's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I gave in to temptation and went there once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a super big mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to go to a place like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This apartment building always interested me. It's bigger than most.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an expensive-looking building. I wonder what kind of people live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would Yuuki be there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get there from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not a bird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the coastline over there too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The next town is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, he's not gonna be in the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fact is it feels good just looking at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The view from here is pretty good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say that gazing at the sky will clear your mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But looking at the sky won't clear away what I went through today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way I could get to the ocean from here is to fly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little far from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He isn't anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I wait a little longer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. He was supposed to be searching around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just standing around this neighborhood won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to look⋯for a lot of reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at it won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what the people living in this city are thinking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do they live their lives?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many houses. It's distracting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The distraction isn't a big deal, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People live in each and every one of these houses.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And every one of those people is living their own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like me to think like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This town never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no guarantee that will always be the case, especially for me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I should go downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the way Toyotomi was talking caught my attention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should stop at home first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, here I go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'll go back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't go back now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about this makes me curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, what's that over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that Toyotomi guy. He's wandering around the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is he doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is Toyotomi in the park at night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm curious. No, I'm beyond curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is he in the park at this hour?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened last night⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can go straight to the park if I go over the guardrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I just have to go there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll try going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might see him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to the park again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ I kind of hate that guy, and I'm curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go over this guardrail and down that grassy hill, it's right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the park.[%p]
