[name]Takuya[line](Phew, a little heavy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](However, I can't say that to Mio.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're almost done, so hang in there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got nothing going on with Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not anymore?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. It's over.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Really, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really, really.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph. I can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm angry now, so I'm going to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please do. It'll be nice and quiet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't look back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't want to see Mio's angry face⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wake me up when we get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I said, when we get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're sleeping, say something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew, she's finally quiet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she asleep?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want her boobs pressing against me too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez. Heh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you chuckling about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! Are you awake?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm just spaced-out. It feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's think inside my head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Idiot! If a man says, 「Heh,」 there's only one thing on his mind!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Bow chicka wow wow, right?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's bow chicka wow wow?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to stop voicing my thoughts⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's stop thinking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew, almost there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's get Mio to her house, and then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And then think about what to do next.)
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How can she fall asleep in such a short period of time?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmm, dad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's your daddy?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah! Oh, you're not my dad, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh? This is my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, this is your house.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I see. We're already here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you sound so upset?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you stand?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't stand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My body is numb, so I don't think I can walk properly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you suggesting I should carry you to your room?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got guts.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You would do it for me, wouldn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't put on a cute face just for show.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But you would carry me, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if I say no?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then I'll sleep here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, suit yourself.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio thinks I'm gonna carry her.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know where the back door is, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, enter here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cross the garden⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Come to the window⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And quietly open the window⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then go inside, quickly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know what, why don't I hold you up and drop you through the window?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hold me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* Oof.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, watch where you're touching⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You sound like an old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just lifted 110 pounds up to the window.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]E-Excuse me, I'm less than 110 pounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Little bit less than 110 pounds.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Little bit more than 100 pounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means you're 105 pounds.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you care?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's important. It's about me being an old man or not.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your weight.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, ugh, that doesn't matter![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it doesn't matter now. Well, then.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going home.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh? Are you really going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course! It's not the time for students to be walking around outside.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you saying the right thing now, out of all times⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want me to stay?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well then, I'll go.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Wait a second. Oh, yeah, you know that tapestry in Ryuuzouji's house? I have a sketch of it. You want to see it, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's quite strange. No, more like, it makes complete sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The tapestry in Ryuuzouji's house, huh.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just a second. I'll bring it out⋯ Ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, don't push yourself.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You were very careful treating me, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just first aid. Even though it's not badly twisted, you should get some rest tonight.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, see you tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you looking at me like that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya&Mio[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Mio, is someone there?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Dad?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Is someone there?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-Nobody's here, of course![%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Well then, I'm coming in.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Dad! I need a minute![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hurry, hide![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hide⋯where?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Think of some place![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about inside that closet?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((What are you doing, Mio?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Inside the bed. Just get inside for now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you must be joking. Why do I have to⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you want to hear my dad's shotgun go off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((I'm opening the door.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]I thought I heard someone's voice.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, it must be your imagination.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, dad⋯where are you going?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you gonna look inside your daughter's closet?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Good thing I didn't hide inside the closet.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]O-Of course there's no one here.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Must be my imagination then.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yes. Just your imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh, Mio is sitting on me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her butt is squeezing me⋯ugh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm happy, yet sad.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]The window is open.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Well, it's hot today.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Hm, it's hot⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Stray dogs are noisy, but it adds to the experience of the season.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What? Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No, maybe it was a stray dog?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm a stray dog?)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, everything's fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not fine. Geez.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]By the way, how is school?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]I know you, and I trust in your grades and your attitude towards education.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-Thanks, Dad.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What do you say⋯ I have a suggestion.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A suggestion?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Would you like to transfer to an American school?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Wait, what? That's so out of the blue![%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]It's not out of the blue, I asked you before.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, we agreed that transferring schools is not the best idea, right?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]There might be some commotion happening around me soon, so I wanted you to avoid all that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He must be talking about the corruption case.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The investigation will happen soon.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just as Mio predicted.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What do you think?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-I⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Actually, I've already signed papers for the procedure. You'll be transferring to an American school in one week.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? But I still want to stay in Japan. I want to stay here for good.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]From now on, we must develop an international perspective. It's important to go abroad and take a look at your own country from the outside.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I understand what you're saying, but⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Do you have something holding you back?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Nothing is holding me back. I still have something I need to do.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Hm, collecting ancient artifacts from the ruins or something like that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They're not ruins. Ancient history, historical studies⋯whatever you may call it. My interest is pure academic exploration.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Hm, so it's not about a boy?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What⋯are you saying?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Okay, good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Parents always know about their kids⋯ Good point, old man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Compared to that, Mio is such a bad liar.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess when you're an old man, you can tell what your kids are up to.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old man?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Old man, huh⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]((My old man⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Why are you looking so upset?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((How can you tell? You're not even looking at me.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I know exactly how you look now. You're looking like you came before you even had sex.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What kind of example is that?!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Your teacher was worried about you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Then please tell her that nothing's wrong.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hrmph, you're so green.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Tell me what happened. Man to man, you can tell me anything.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hrmph.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What happened? Did you do something you're ashamed of?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I would never.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Well then, talk to me. I've lived just a bit longer than you, so you might be able to hear some unexpected advice.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I wouldn't force you to talk. You can tell me when you're ready.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I just beat up some bastard at school, that's all.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I see. And the reason?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Because he pissed me off.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I see.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Right.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hm.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Aren't you gonna yell at me?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Do you want me to say something?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((It's just not what I expected. An ordinary parent would definitely be grumbling by now.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Then, let me tell you this. Takuya, darling, you are absolutely, positively a ridiculous, immoral hoodlum!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What do you think?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah, that's better.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Okay, good. So, what really ticked you off?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I don't know.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hmm, is it because your mother's dead? Is that what bothered you?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((*flinch*))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You were picked on because you have a single parent. Am I right?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Wh-Why do you think so?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Because I know the only time you'd hurt somebody is when they've spoken badly about someone you love.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Make sure you go for the belly. Not the face.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah, that's what I did. I'm sorry I got suspended.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I see.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yeah.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What are you going to do now?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I don't know.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((If you still want to go to school, I can introduce you to a good academy.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((A friend of mine is the campus president there, and he runs the school.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I don't think they'll want to take in someone like me.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ryuuzouji is not such a small-minded man. I can talk to him, if you want me to.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Do you have anything you want to do?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I do. But⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Then, go do it.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Listen to me.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Are you worried about failing? Learn from your failures. Don't repeat the same path, and all will be fine.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Believe in yourself and trust your own way. If you go forward without giving up, a goddess will surely smile upon you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((You're the only person who would ever say that with a straight face.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Yes. That is why I know there's truth to what I say.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Go forward without giving up, huh?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Right.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Old man, you always make me think. What exactly is your way of life?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Old man, say something.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Say something!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Old man⋯ Are you still alive?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((If you're alive⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯ I fell off the bed again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew, another pleasant morning has come⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No joke, seriously this is⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is M-Mio's room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, remember, try to remember what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was researching about Triangle Mountain with Mio and then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, there was an accident at Triangle Mountain. The truck was covered in flames.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then the school infirmary. Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I gave Mio a piggyback ride and came all the way here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then, that's where it gets blurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I can recall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a knock on the door. Someone knocking on that door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, just like that. What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((Mio, are you still here?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Aah! Is that Mio's father the shotgun collector?!)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((I just heard a loud noise. If you are inside, answer me. If not, I'm coming in.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no⋯ If I answer, I'll be in trouble, and if I don't, I'll still get in trouble.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, I guess running is always the best strategy in battle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The window!)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]((I'm coming in.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Run![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line](Ouch. I'm glad it was a first floor. That was a hard dive.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What? What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯ Let's hurry up and run away.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Run away? It sounds like I'm a thief.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]I hear something from the back. Ho, cometh out thee nuthook![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How old is Mio's father?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A-Anyway, let's hurry up and run away from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should be safe here⋯)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]He must be outside, look for him outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff, heave, pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I climbed up the entire hill. Geez. *huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be safe here⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Check the Heights too! He can't be too far![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff, heave, pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be safe here⋯*huff, heave, pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should go a little further, just in case.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you remember what I told you before?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I forgot.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're mean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding. Shall I start reciting what you said?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No, that's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it went like⋯「It would be very beneficial for both of us, if you don't mind me asking for advice.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Did I say that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You did.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Liar. That's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「It would be very beneficial for both of us,」 I like that part.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm saying, I like it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? Wh-What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like weird bugs.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*chomp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch! Don't bite my ear![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph. Say that again, and I'll hit you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hands are occupied.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can still headbutt you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're tougher than I thought.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, tell me something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did the chicken cross the street? To get laid![%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're lame⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't rub your face against me like a puppy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My hands are occupied.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't rub your runny nose on me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't have a runny nose![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say that so loud. Everybody is watching you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph, I don't care. I'm already in a bad situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see, so you don't care now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shall I start flashing everyone? Here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, don't joke around.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Haha, panicking, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're acting strange.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, I know. Something feels strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But I'm surprised.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I thought you're more indifferent, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am⋯indifferent. I do realize I don't show much emotion.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even when my old man died, I didn't have any special feelings.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Liar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What were you thinking at that time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I immediately thought about the future. What to do about the house, and about school expenses.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How indifferent of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But at the same time, I thought he might still be alive somewhere.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Dr Arima is⋯still alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a feeling, I have no proof. But I just felt so. Maybe that's why.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a feeling?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now it's more like I know it, for sure.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Can I ask you something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're gonna ask, 「What were you talking to Ms. Ichijou about?」 right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have nothing to do with her anymore. Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But I⋯worry about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me imagine things too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know you're making an 「I'm disgusted」 face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see you but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You probably look like you hate being on my back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I guess you get really expressive, sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]While shamefully looking down, you endure my finger technique.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You probably look like that, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? no? Then, the expression of ecstatic tranquility shivering with pleasure⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm talking about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's probably got weird ears or something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not true![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can feel her right ear against my neck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure about the other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What if her left ear feels just as weird against my neck as her right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't stand that tickling anymore! Ah ha ha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-Why are you laughing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That tickles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hair is so long, Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's really curly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Every time it brushes against my face, it tickles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But at the same time, it feels kinda nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trouble is, whenever there's even the tiniest breeze, it blows right into my face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it gets in my nose, I'll sne–aaaachoooo![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll sneeze. Just like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you have a cold or something, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's got perfect teeth and such plump lips⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'd rather not kiss that mouth of hers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My lips deserve far better than that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why do you keep muttering to yourself like that? You're being gross.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one could resist kissing me though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get a haircut pretty soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm starting to get tired of these bangs.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your hair is always such a mess, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, excuse me![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Maybe I should style it for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know how I should take that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, it's me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Though I understand why you'd want to keep searching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got to find that super, amazing, perfect, nice guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hehe⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You must be tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, it's my body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm just past downtown.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Downtown⋯ That's a pretty slow taxi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, excuse me![%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, it's just taking its sweet time about getting there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she replying to what I just said?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's hand⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can just barely feel the weight of it on my shoulder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio has such a light touch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's she thinking about back there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to use that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. Now isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure there will be a hint when the time comes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I talking to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knock it off![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Eek! Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wasn't talking to you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're so weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now she's calling me a weirdo.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I already said this isn't the time to use that.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You talk to yourself a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's it matter to you?[%p]
