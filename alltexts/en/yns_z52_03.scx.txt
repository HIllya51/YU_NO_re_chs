[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. This place is totally different from the world I come from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Observing those facts while napping at the top of the hill is my daily routine now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, this is how I'll be spending every day here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Humans become very conservative in situations like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They secure clothing, shelter, and food, and keep important people close by⋯ And what happens then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They try to maintain their way of life. Look for stability.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that's exactly what I'm doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been a year since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I tried so hard to look for a way back home the first week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was desperately trying to find my home. The place where I belong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never did find a way back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My home. My world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, Eriko, Mitsuki, Mio, Kanna, Yuuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯and that old bastard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can only admit this now, but I punched that rock until my hands bled and I cried.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I even thought about throwing myself off that cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had a real bad case of homesickness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was Celes who stayed with me, silently, the whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She even stayed with me when I cried⋯when I bled.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was like a child, shoving my face into my pillow and bawling my eyes out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She stayed beside me, smiling the whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seemed so familiar, but I don't know why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, I felt something special⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]*giggle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, is that you⋯? Get her off of my face, will you?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Owowowow! Don't bite my nose, please.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*chuckle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes, don't just laugh. Get Yu-No for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I thought I was going to suffocate for a second.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you get bigger since the last time I saw you?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not trying to keep a record of her growth or anything, she's just grown up so quickly.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess I can't complain as long as she's strong and healthy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I say that now, but parents always end up yelling at their kids to do their homework.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that? My index finger again?[%p]
*hug*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hands definitely got bigger.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mm, she's growing up nice and healthy.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mom⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't grab your mom's boobs like that. Those are mine, you know.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*chuckle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be helped how fast she's growing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll be all grown up before we know it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As her parent, I can't wait to see her grow up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're going to be beautiful when you get older.[%p]
*bonk*[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Mnah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your little cheeks are so rosy. You're adorable.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My child⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No has grown so much since I started caring for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe she's been growing TOO much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]She started walking sooner than I thought she would.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]As far as I know, girls in my world start walking long after she did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]What's even more surprising is hearing her talk already, even if it's gibberish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]A little girl, less than a year old in this world and already talking⋯[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]Yu-No changed my whole perception of a baby's growth with how fast she grows, in body and mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]After just a year, she was already pulling me around the fields.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Life as a family of three has begun⋯[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]A basic lifestyle for humans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]If there were such a thing, this would be it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]I gather fruit, nuts, berries and fish daily for food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Nature has taught me so much all the while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]We've become one, loving each other each and every day.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]I can see that other world before my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]My life in that world seems so empty now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]What is the life of a human? How are humans supposed to live?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]I can hardly believe I'm even thinking about all of this.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]It's not like I've been living idly here or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]I train every day with the sword Illia gave me just in case something goes down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]My family.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]This is what I have to do to protect my irreplaceable family.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]Yu-No grows more and more each day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]She grows far faster than people in my world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Some people say that children grow up too fast, but Yu-No really did. Things that took me years only took her weeks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Her mind and body are growing more like an adult with each passing day. She's maturing, that's for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Even if she is my own daughter, a girl becoming a full adult so quickly is⋯troubling.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]Yu-No is very lively, and she loves to mess around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]⋯but still listens to Celes and I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]As I watch Yu-No grow and grow, I start to feel older.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]Of course, she's not just growing physically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]She's very smart and clever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]She understands everything I tell her, and even develops thoughts for herself. In every way, her mind's fully matured.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Of course, I teach her all about basic societal values and morality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]But even though I teach her that, it is based on my world.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]It could all be hogwash here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Celes never batted an eye, so I must not have been too far off the mark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Maybe the things humans do in every world are basically the same.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Yeah. The same in every world.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="64"]I can't think of a life without them anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]I really had no idea how conservative I was until now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]I'm surprised at myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="32"]⋯[%e]
[name]Takuya[line][margin top="256"]It's been almost four years since I came to this world.[%e]
[name]Takuya[line]From the top of this big hill, I can see everything around us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lazing around, letting your mouth hang wide open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking like an idiot doesn't matter, because no one can see you up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so nice and warm today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty cloudy, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They block the strong sunlight, making it nice and comfortable out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are many strange things about this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what that means, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, there's this sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is the biggest difference I've found.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This sun above my head. It's in the same place at the same time, every single day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It rises and sets, but that's it. It's a sun that likes to keep a schedule.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know what that means?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the sun is in the same place at the same time, that means the planet's axis is vertical.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, that means this place has no seasons, unlike Japan. It's always very warm. A perpetual summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, not even I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯really know what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've read that the Earth's axis was once completely vertical a very long time ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, I don't know if that's what this place is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, the difference in the flora and fauna is just too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the ecosystems I've seen here are familiar to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yet nearly every day, I still run into new types of birds or plants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For instance, that bonbon plant in front of my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never seen or heard anything about a plant like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Illia left quite a few books in the house, but I can't read the letters of this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't even any diagrams, so I have no idea what's going on in them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes can read them, but she has a very hard time explaining the details to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only I could read those books, maybe I'd understand something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that monster I saw⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so incredibly strange to me that something like that could even exist here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure if this fits into the category of being fortunate, but I haven't seen another monster like it since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which has me curious for different reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go back and check all that research I've been doing for the past year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First thing's first. The cliff.
[name]Takuya[line]Illia said this was the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means it's what divides this country, Dela Grante, and another.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And this giant cliff is where that monster came from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means something is down there. At the very least, it means something living is down there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I tried making a long rope. Tied together a bunch of strong vines⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯but the bottom of the cliff was way too far down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be hundreds of feet just to reach the clouds down below.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Making a rope that long isn't very practical.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As you might expect, I gave up after a couple dozen feet or so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aside from the curiosity I have that something is beyond that cliff, I know nothing about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. There are still so many things I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is an irreplaceable woman to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do remember the possibility of Celes being a priestess, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. She gave up her own ability to speak in order to receive the message of God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But even though she might have lost her words, I remember⋯
[name]Takuya[line]When Illia died⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯it felt like she spoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Living with Celes, I had to teach her about so many things every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For better or for worse, she doesn't seem to know jack about the world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She can't sew, she's never been scolded, laundry is a no-no, and on top of all that, she doesn't know how to clean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She knows nothing about the ABC's of house chores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I took care of all that for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm used to it. After my mother died, I had to take care of that old bastard, my dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aside from teaching him manners, I took care of everything around the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right now, we're working on helping Celes adjust to life out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is a very smart lady, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After teaching her, Celes' skills in sewing, laundry, and cleaning far surpassed mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that she's taking care of that stuff, I can spend more time going out to search for food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Division of labor at its finest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I love Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes thinks the same way about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was inevitable that the realization of our love formed between us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, I find it hard to believe that I was gifted a child at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel so strange, not wanting to let Celes go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. I can't help but worry incessantly that one day Celes will tell me she wants to go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems to be a priestess from the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A priestess, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She uses the power of God to calm the rage of mother nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When God finally descends upon her, what will happen to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will she become God herself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her home is in the Imperial Capital, beyond the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, she never talks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We communicate mainly using body language.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. Most things are through body language.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Especially in bed. Oh, what am I thinking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Recently though, I can pretty much tell what she's thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「We don't need words.」 Such a cheesy line actually applies to us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, it was tough to get to this point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to go to the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Imperial Capital, I wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like a very lively city with lots of people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, I'd like to see it some day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't had someone to talk to in a whole year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes never says a single word.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm basically stuck talking at Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, I would never go near the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not impossible for me to go by myself if I wanted to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean to brag, but I do have a lot of confidence in my own stamina.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ever since that monster appeared and attacked Illia, I haven't missed a single day of training.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why haven't I gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because I'm afraid of going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'm afraid Celes will leave me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've still never been there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe I should say I couldn't bring myself to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have to walk across the Rafaelo Desert for a week to get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even with enough food and water, it would still be a perilous trek.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't even planned it out yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should think things through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey, you just lied down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I ponder about things here as a part of my daily routine. I need to do that now.[%p]
