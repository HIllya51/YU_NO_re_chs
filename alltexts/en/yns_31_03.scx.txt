[name]Takuya[line](I finally found Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To tell you the truth, I talked to Ryuuzouji a bit last night.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The professor?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. We talked about my old man, research⋯ We just went on and on.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is that so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji seemed scared in the diary, but last night, he was completely put together.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did that one page of his diary say?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think I remember. Um⋯[%p]
「⋯terrifying. What kind of person is she⋯ask for my help?」[%p]
「⋯to me, that is something of Koudai's. I'm sure of it.」[%p]
「If she has, then⋯terrifying⋯」[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It must have been right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, leave it to a history teacher to have such a good memory.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't make fun of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who 「she」 is?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji wrote, 「I don't know what kind of person she is.」 So it looks like he doesn't seem to know either.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Possibly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of person 「she」 could be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, what's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're so quiet all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing⋯ I just thought of something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know the show News Presence?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, I heard its viewership is really good. She's only on a few times a week, but that's the show with the cute woman as a news anchor, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen her meet with Ryuuzouji before.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Could it be her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure. That's all I can think of for now though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, I'd like to meet with that Kaori woman again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder where I'd be able to meet her.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Mitsuki, are you here?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh no! Ryuuzouji just got home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your boss?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's him⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's home? If we bump into him, we'll be in deep shit.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll make sure he doesn't come over this way.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll make sure he doesn't come over this way. Oh!
[name]Voice[line]Mitsuki, are you here?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Y-Yes! I'm here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Try not to go anywhere. Once things settle down, I'll come get you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just stay right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* This sure is a lot of work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki went to the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The storehouse entrance is as quiet as ever.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I didn't even notice it was like that until about a month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A month ago? That's pretty weird.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was built six months ago, and it was all messed up a month ago. That means it was destroyed in just five months.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's what the math says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how bad the construction work was, wouldn't five months be a little quick?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But this is how it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must have been built like that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No⋯ It looked much better six months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So someone intentionally messed it up a month ago?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why would someone do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no clue.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Isn't it strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, it is strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was looking for you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry, I was examining the well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The well?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's over there on the left. There's an old well not too far away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A dried up well, huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found the page of that diary near there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Really? A page of the diary by a dried up well?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, but it was in the professor's lab before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His lab?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The professor was looking through the lab for the diary. He asked me if I had seen it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the lab?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, did he find it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He stopped looking for it as soon as I got there. When I asked him if I could help, he refused.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But then, why was that one piece of paper found in the well?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, so Ryuuzouji was looking for his diary in the lab. This is strange.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He still looks for it when he goes to the lab sometimes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The diary?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, that's kinda weird.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]By the way, what did you find in the storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you remember what you said last night? That the storehouse suddenly got all messed up?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes⋯ When do you think that storehouse is from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like when was it built?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, something like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the mansion itself was built around 400 years ago, right?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You sure know your stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, so that means it's at least several hundred years old.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It was built six months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Six months ago?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's calmly smiling at me.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong? You're staring at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could handle just about any hairstyle, even a mohawk.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think you'd look good no matter what.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What are you trying to say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hairstyle makes you look like someone's secretary.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Haha! I am a secretary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez, I can't take my eyes off her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Boink.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What does 「boink」 mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, uh⋯that's just my way of saying I find you attractive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha ha⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You liar. Your nose has grown a foot long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not even possible![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is clothing that revealing even allowed here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess I don't mind though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That top you've got on is an interesting style⋯those slits⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. It's great for just about everything, and it's really comfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not what I'm worried about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That blouse, vest, and skirt are a matching set.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's called a three-piece suit; it's fairly expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty sharp. Looks good on you, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ha⋯ Thank you. It was a gift from my boss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your boss?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was a gift from Ryuuzouji? Tsk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why am I feeling like this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her skin has such a nice sheen to it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Not even a smudge of lipstick is out of place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that little red scar?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Nothing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Liar.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks familiar.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No comment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Too bad she quit part-time lecturing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So your competitor is Ms. Eriko, the school physician.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You mean that glamorous teacher, Eriko Takeda?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, the teacher who always goes around with a cigarette in her mouth.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll consider it a compliment to be compared to that lovely woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're elegant, but Ms. Eriko has a great body.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't say things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're one of the top two most beautiful women in this school.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Gee, thanks.[%p]
