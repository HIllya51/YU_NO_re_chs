[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't stop thinking about what Ms. Eriko said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Footsteps. Someone's coming! Is it Ryuuzouji?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh. It'll only be trouble if someone finds me here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, it's getting closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do? Is there anywhere to hide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said he was looking for something in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about it. What could he be looking for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki said he was looking for a journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A journal⋯ I remember finding a ripped page from some old journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like they were afraid of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would the journal be in the laboratory? So weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, Mitsuki said Ryuuzouji was looking for a journal in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would the journal be in the laboratory? So weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I just rip off the numbers on the bottom, it'll look fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm much more interested in the girl above the numbers though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A teacher must have drawn this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some weird drawing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I turn this, the door should open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not really something that needs explaining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A doorknob. Not a door Bob.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's Bob?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. I hope it doesn't place me under arrest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. The teachers must be using it to drink stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this going to stay here all summer vacation?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A completely empty fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Any beverages inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here. It's not even plugged in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lamp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lamp that you can bend and turn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bunch of notes on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I might be able to hide in the locker for a little while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, into the locker I go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The footsteps are getting closer.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like someone has business in the laboratory.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did Ryuuzouji come back for something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They came into the room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should focus on just listening⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like the footsteps are too light for them to be Ryuuzouji's.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Those legs are thin, like a woman's.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, they stopped.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this person doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should try quietly opening the locker.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Very, very quietly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that⋯a big, round ass?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ms. Eriko?!)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Huh. I thought it was here, but I guess not.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If it exists, it'll provide the grounds for my argument⋯ It's like night and day.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's no use looking up there for the documents, either. So maybe under the desk? Or under the chair?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Ms. Eriko doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's searching for something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Searching for⋯what?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whatever it is, she sure is acting strange.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Under the desk⋯it could be under the drawers.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That man⋯or maybe Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If they were to hide it, where else could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hide it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she talking about Mitsuki?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What would Mitsuki be hiding?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just what is Ms. Eriko up to?)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line](Over here, Ichijou.)[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line](Yes, sir.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh no![%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line](Let's go into the laboratory for now. No one should be in there.)[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line](Yes⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Tsk. Oh well.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I should hide in the locker.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You're kidding me, right?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, she's coming right toward me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's going to bump right into me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, what a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kinda cramped, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm actually sorta happy about this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, get it together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place to hide.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Speaking of places to hide, what about over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be able to get inside there if I open it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, how am I supposed to hide in there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the time to be looking into these documents?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure I have somewhere else to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't it either⋯or this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Footsteps. Someone's coming! Is it Ryuuzouji?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh. It'll only be trouble if someone finds me here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, it's getting closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do? Is there anywhere to hide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not this. This isn't it, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, with all these documents here I doubt I'll ever find the one I'm looking for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These are all perfectly normal history books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anything Ryuuzouji might have been looking for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wasn't he looking for some kind of journal?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would Ryuuzouji's journal be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anything that looks like Ryuuzouji's journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like Ryuuzouji's journal is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With so many documents in here, it could be anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't any documents I particularly want to take a look at.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're just a bunch of documents all piled up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯what about this one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this? 「Love Slaves」? That's a crazy title.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I read the whole thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many books here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I've read this one before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「An Introduction to S&M for Beginners.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is that softcore stuff that's popular. I was worried when Ayumi found my copy, but she ended up reading it too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, it's very deep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would a book like this be here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this document?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A Newspaper Read Upside Down is Still a Newspaper.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's so much stuff in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, this thing looks like a phonebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「An Introduction to History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A truly boring book, I can tell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, this is the textbook Mitsuki was using in her history class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「A Book of Hard to Understand History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Books that say 「Easy to Understand」 are never easy, but this one is a whole lot different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Textbooks usually go the safe route, so they're all filled with the same theories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, this book explains all the lies and mistakes in textbooks up until now, as well as all kinds of theories, and really explains everything in an easily understandable way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't my old man tell me to read this a long time ago?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Author: Koudai Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh, I shouldn't have read that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A memo board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are notes and schedules on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks messy, but these things are pretty convenient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A regular analog clock. I can hear the seconds tick by.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an analog clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's weird to see, considering how everything is digitized nowadays.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are even clocks that have digital needles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A chair. I prefer sitting in a chariot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The teachers use these chairs, I bet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mitsuki's chair was the one in the back. *sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It stinks. Thinking about it, I'm pretty sure this was some dirty old man's seat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A desk. Surprisingly, I've studied here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they have any meetings here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I remember studying with Mitsuki here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a regular, fluorescent light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fluorescent light for the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are shut to block the setting sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The setting sun shines right in this room. That's why the blinds are always shut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be cool if money came falling down while I stared at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's going to fall down so I should stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A vent⋯for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. I better not hold a lighter up to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. It sprays out water if a fire breaks out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't think it's too bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, who's that stud in the mirror?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last time I said that, Mitsuki kept asking me, 「Where?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was here with Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I can't even look at her straight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still can't believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It may be a locker, but I don't know if I'm locked and loaded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This locker is deeper than it looks. Seems big enough for two people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bookshelf filled with specialized books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but specialized books in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just looking at it makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This room sure is a mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the teachers hang out, so they could keep it a little cleaner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should leave the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wasn't there some more stuff I needed to check?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should leave the laboratory.[%p]
