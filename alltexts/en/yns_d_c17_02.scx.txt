[name]Takuya[line]Don't stand up! It'll strike you![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-Then what should we do?! If we stay here, we'll just get burnt to a crisp![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be something we can do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Aaahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]I was shocked a bit. It looks like I'm okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. Are we gonna get burnt to a crisp here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That or starve like Professor Imagawa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ What a lovely picture of the future.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So what's the best way to die?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's obvious. Dying of old age in your bed.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe⋯ That would be nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We probably won't get out of this, but I'm going to say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Save it. I'll listen when we're safe.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be something we can do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahhhhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Are you okay, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's like my body was shot through with electricity or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not 「or something.」 You got shocked.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was probably the aftermath of the electrical discharge. If it was a direct hit, you'd be burnt to a crisp.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do we do? What do we do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit⋯ Takuya, you have to think.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There must be something we can do!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gaah![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-That was close. Right next to us⋯ Look![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, the floor is gouged out.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What do we do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll use that![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Use what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The thing I don't have.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you okay, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It looks like the only entrance is over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, a lightning rod![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this works, we can avoid the lightning and the entrance will open. It's two birds with one stone.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll use that! If we use that over there⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, but I don't have it![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you okay, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's just nothing I can do in this situation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to go back and get that thing from somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To do that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's blocked by heavy boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The boulders collapsed when Ms. Ichijou fired the gun. That's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That door looks sturdy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Will it be hard to get out through there⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't go that way, not with those big boulders there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It would be difficult with two people. We'd need a crane.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, should we go back for now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, that's right. To that lake⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean the water?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With all this electricity being discharged? There's nothing but water over there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'd burn to a crisp the moment your feet touched the water.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And even if we did go back, that doesn't solve the problem. I think this is the only exit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay⋯ Then what do we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know what Mio wants to say⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's dangerous here, and even if we go back we'll still get turned to ashes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I supposed to do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we use that, we could avoid the lightning.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ I want to think a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. I know why that tower is covered in vinyl.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Covered in vinyl⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an insulator. It's a precaution against electrocution.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a device that generates lightning⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't believe it. A device that generates lightning? It's like something out of science fiction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Science fiction⋯ I guess you could say that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And it's been running for eight thousand years? Unbelievable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right. I'm sure no one but us would believe it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Also, Mr. Ryuuzouji and Ms. Ichijou. Oh, and Professor Imagawa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess there's a lot of people who would believe it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's right in front of us. I believe it, even if I don't want to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was Professor Imagawa after this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And Ryuuzouji, too?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was my old man after?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a little smoke coming out⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's water vapor.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The water on the surface is shimmering. It's like a dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there was no possibility of dying, I'd like to relax and take it all in.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Look. There's only a little, but it's smoke.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electrical discharge is creating water vapor.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]From the water on the boulders?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Can't you feel it getting more humid?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we do, we can avoid the lightning, and if we're lucky, the door might open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's shining⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The noise is getting louder and louder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! I-It's happening again![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Lightning is striking right now! Outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope there wasn't a disaster.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The Geo Technics people might have started transporting earth again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They did say they were going to continue transportation work this morning⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means it's already morning.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is everyone okay?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But even if we're not accounting for this huge machine, there's still a problem we haven't solved.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A problem we haven't solved?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the lightning strikes were caused by this thing⋯ Well, it's higher than a 99 percent chance that's the case.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, more lightning strikes occur during transportation work.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I have heard that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Maybe it's a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't science about inquiring into certainties?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Documenting chaos is also science.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have you ever heard the phrase 『a pretext is never wanting』?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shut up. So what do you think the reason is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm thinking about it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's ridiculous. How could a machine observe Geo Technics's transportation work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Can this device really observe them?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This piece of science fiction is⋯observing everything?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What exactly is Geo Technics digging up?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could it be that stuff in the lake⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The rare metal that Ryuuzouji is so interested in⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It might have something to do with this⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Look at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ It sounds like it's growling. Incredible⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Light is released from the tower, burning people in hellfire⋯ This is what's depicted in that tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Possibly.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The thunder of the gods⋯ Indra's light. This is the greatest discovery in history.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're still saying that in this situation?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I mean, think about it. This could even be proof for theology itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's a lot of electricity being released up top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top is almost completely covered in lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's discharging indiscriminately and glowing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]My body feels a little numb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stay down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electricity is discharging pretty high above us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You'll definitely get burned up if you stand⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We should probably take off all our metal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Because it's lightning? You're older than I thought.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just an old wives' tale intended to ease people's minds. It doesn't really do anything.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Taking metal off your body when there's thunder doesn't make a difference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lightning tends to strike at the highest point. It has incredibly high voltage, so it can even easily strike nonconductors.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]High places are the most dangerous.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're only smart about the weirdest things⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]We're in trouble if we stay here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. I'm thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I say that, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have no idea what to do.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll use this iron sword as a lightning rod.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lightning might blow the boulders away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this works, you ought to thank me. I'm gonna go jam this sword in over there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-That's dangerous! You'll die![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We will die either way.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'll do what I can and let luck handle the rest. This is the only way.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. Everyone has to die at some point.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not fine at all! I don't like this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, so you just want to die here then?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If we're together, it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No⋯ What am I supposed to do if you die here, Takuya?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't die.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Promise me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I promise.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Liar![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, what do you want me to say?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fine. I won't die.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How can you be sure?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, I love you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you trust me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-If it's just for a little bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What evidence can I even give you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean exactly what I say.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, I trust you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good. Hide in the corner. Make sure you stay as low as you can.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Crawl like a lizard![%p]
[name]Mio[line]At least tell me to crawl like a cute little Pomeranian.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never mind![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, watch this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll throw it from here like a javelin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yaahh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya⋯ Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯ Is that you, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you okay?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I can't see anything. I looked right into that super bright light.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm fine. My sight will come back in a little bit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Good⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not good. How many times did I tell you to stay hidden?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯ But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you crying?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]O-Of course not![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's happening?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a huge tremor⋯ An earthquake?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]The floor is shaking![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a shockwave from an explosion. This is bad.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Shockwave?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the machine broke.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A piece of cultural heritage has been running for more than eight thousand years, and I broke it. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's very irresponsible.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Aaahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is really bad.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are we going to do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah! Run![%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯if we stand, we'll get struck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hold the lightning off for a minute.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll cross my fingers and hope for the best.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's ridiculous![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm crossing my fingers, aren't I? Run on ahead![%p]
[name]Mio[line]M-Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I, uh⋯ I'll carry Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no time to think. Go![%p]
[name]Mio[line]You better follow after me, Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah⋯ Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki! How did you get wounded?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The lightning⋯ It struck me. Bad luck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! You were unconscious, so you were low to the ground.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Where it strikes is just a matter of probabilities⋯ It just happened to be my body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I-It's all the way through her⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sh-She won't make it⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya⋯ I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He⋯told me something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He said you're Takuya, yet you're not Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But to me, you're⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't have to talk anymore.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I want to say it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry⋯ Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Why are you apologizing?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I was⋯controlled by the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I couldn't resist him⋯so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I guess it was fate⋯ I had a feeling it would end this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no such thing as fate! Nothing like that can control our lives![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hmm⋯ That's just like you, Takuya. Maybe you really are the person I know⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Be careful⋯ Ryuuzouji has changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He said⋯that you would disappear again after ten hours had passed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He called it⋯chaos correction⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯enough⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The headmaster⋯ What you have, Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whaa?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-Mitsuki⋯ Hey! Hey!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're kidding. Wake up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a long path.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How long does it go?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is bad⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It will be dangerous here soon, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I just hope I didn't go in a huge circle and end up back where I started.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's getting brighter. Mio![%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's the exit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The exit? Could it be⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Look, Takuya! It's so bright! It's the exit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really the exit?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's the exit! We're saved![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, both of us are saved⋯)[%p]
Go to Mio's END
Continue on the regular route
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain and the coastline⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up? Did you find it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No⋯ The entrance is blocked; there's nothing there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even Mitsuki⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It looks like the coastline has calmed down a little after all those lightning strikes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet. With how bad things are, it can't be helped⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But now there won't be any more lightning strikes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I hope, anyway.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Everything's buried underground now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not true⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's still a lot left⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wonder what that machine was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lightning generation device.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It couldn't have been that. Remember 5W1H.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Five what and one huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who, what, when, where, why, and how.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]By who, where, how, and for what reason was that machine built? That's what I want to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was built by someone, somewhere, somehow, and for some reason.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not an answer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what the answer is though⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But I really hate not knowing. Human history might have been turned on its head, just like Professor Imagawa said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't be turned on its head.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter what we find, our lives won't change. After a little time passes, everyone will forget and go back to their lives.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're such a pessimist. What about Ms. Ichijou's death?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh⋯ I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go on.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But what should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]About Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't dig her out. It's too deep.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Will you tell the police?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would I tell them? There was a huge cave underground which held some glowing ore⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an eight-thousand-year-old civilization, and Professor Imagawa was mummified next to some skeletons⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, and there was this giant lightning generation device, and Mitsuki died when it struck her with lightning⋯ Then everything got buried. Please believe me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hehe⋯ No one would believe that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'd end up in a mental hospital for being delusional.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are we going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to see Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm going too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's not afraid to pull a gun, you know?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dangerous.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then we should go to the police–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what would we tell them?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We don't have any proof. We can't bring Ryuuzouji to justice.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you going to do then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is gone. Ryuuzouji will have to explain that somehow.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're going now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. Maybe in a different time and place.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I can be here anymore.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What is that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tell you. I come from a parallel world. I'm not from this world⋯ Probably.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't believe me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-I don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't you believe me?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I mean⋯ That's crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty crazy that Triangle Mountain was actually a lightning generation device.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You say you can't stay here⋯ Does that mean you'll disappear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know what will happen. I just know I won't be here. At least, it seems that way.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's a lot of assumptions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't been able to see it with my own eyes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, whatever. I just wanted to tell you, Mio. So you wouldn't freak out if the person you know as me disappears.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You won't disappear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want to bet on it? I've got ten bucks that say I disappear.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Stop kidding around. Takuya?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya! Stop joking around! Come out![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay, I give up. I lose. So get out here!!![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya! What are you doing? Come on, please![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-You're kidding me, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯ Come on, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Answer me!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My head hurts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My cheeks too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They sting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ Ayumi and I were⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was⋯ Yeah. I was going to⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's cold⋯ I wonder why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't a bed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. I'm looking for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I have to ask Ryuuzouji some questions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use the Iron Sword there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like that isn't the right item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. What am I gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you going to do? Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
