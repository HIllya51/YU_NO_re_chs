[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa whoa whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the⋯? What's going on?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]((The king's name has been acknowledged!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you talking about?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]((The door shall be opened⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯? The Reflector is glowing⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Wake up, idiot.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hey⋯ I'm talking to you!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hmph⋯ Still a sloth, I see.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What's that supposed to mean, you ask?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((All you do is eat and sleep, like a sloth.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What? You didn't ask me that?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Well I just felt like saying it. Hahaha!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯What's with that face? It makes you look even uglier than usual.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Anyway⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯Ah. So, Ryuuzouji⋯ That fool went to the base of Triangle Mountain and⋯ I see.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I wanted to send a letter to warn him, but I didn't know about it yet. Hahaha!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hm? Why do I know about it, you ask?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((It's quite a long story, but I know that Ryuuzouji isn't all that he seems.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I don't know the details about his background, however.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((That school physician may be the only one that does.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ah⋯ So you've slept with Ayumi.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Making some moves while the head of the household is away, are you? Ahaha, so you finally managed to win her heart, huh?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What? That's not how it is?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Takuya, my boy, here's what you must understand about being an adulterer⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What's that? Talking to me makes your head hurt?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Why, there's no need to talk. You only need to think⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ah, so you've met Kanna?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((She's a nice girl, isn't she? If only I was 10 years younger⋯ You don't want to hear it, huh?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Well, if you're going to marry someone, marry a girl like Ayumi or Kanna. You're not as independent as you think you are.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You can't accomplish anything without a strong woman by your side. You're just like me in that sense, hahaha!))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯I see, so Kanna is in good health.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((She is unable to live without the assistance of a special stone⋯just like my wife.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Ah, so you gave her the Hypersense Stone⋯ I see.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((That was a surprisingly good move, coming from you. You saved Kanna's life.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯You saw that machine underneath Triangle Mountain, didn't you?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Beneath Triangle Mountain, there is a giant lightning generator⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯And it's also used as a watchtower.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What do I mean by that?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I mean, it's a terrifying device for bringing divine wrath down upon those who do commit wrongful deeds.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What's considered a 「wrongful deed,」 you ask?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((All you've been doing is asking questions. Why don't you think for yourself a bit⋯ What?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You want to know why I'm answering questions even though you haven't said anything?))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Very well⋯ I suppose I'll tell you.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((In this world there's no need for words.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯Although, you likely won't be able to understand what I mean quite yet.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯In a philosophic sense, I suppose this place could be what's known as the world of Forms.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hahaha⋯ I see question marks springing out from your head.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Sorry, I should stick to words that can be comprehended by your ant-like brain.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hey now, don't throw a tantrum, Takuya⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((It seems you've built up quite a history.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((To build history is to create a world.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((To create a world is to traverse through unlimited possibilities.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((This does not mean history will be repeated time and time again. Instead, it is stacked upon itself.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You've personally witnessed, listened, and felt many things. Those experiences become history and accumulate over time.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((And in turn, they become memories⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((In other words, you've been engraving history⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯That's right, into Vrinda's Tree⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((What you've been doing hasn't been pointless.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((All of your actions are engraved into history.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((History never repeats itself.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Even if you were to go back in time, the fact that you went back in time will only be added onto history.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((History is the flow of phenomena itself.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((And phenomena are all bound by the law of causality.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((They follow the elements in the flow of events, and like a river, they flow downstream from above.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Even time itself cannot defy this law.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((In fact⋯no one can.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯Or so I thought.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Until I came to know of them⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I do not claim to understand all there is to know in the universe.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((But I do feel as if I've touched upon a segment of the truth.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I am leaning against Vrinda's Tree, which controls all phenomena of the universe and beyond.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((This is why I'm able to understand your thoughts⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯Along with all that has happened in the past⋯and all that will happen in the future.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((I'm sure we will meet again.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((That is the weight of phenomena⋯and the inertial force of their elements.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((If you want to get literary, you could also call it fate.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Fate⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((To free yourself from this binding is no simple task.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((And now, there is a massive inertial force working within the flow of phenomenal elements.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You must first feel that inertia yourself with your own eyes.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((It's almost time⋯))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Hahaha⋯ The concept of time is meaningless.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((You will realize this⋯when the time comes.))[%p]
[name]Man[line]((Farewell⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Wait!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Dad⋯ You're my dad, aren't you?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((There's so much I still want to ask you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I came all the way here! Answer me!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What did you do?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((No, what are you trying to do?!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Dad!!))[%p]
