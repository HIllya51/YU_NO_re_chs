[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried about Celes. I should return home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to be gawking at the scenery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's hurry up and go home![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lots of trees, fields all around, and a desert that lies beyond all of that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still undeniably a beautiful view.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really shouldn't just be looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The forest⋯ It seems like it wasn't affected by the earthquake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A place with such vibrant trees is a treasure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A seemingly endless desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was called the Rafaelo Desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see our house all the way back there, to the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To the right. That small house is ours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see how bad the damage is from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, back to the house![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried sick about Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are we going back to the forest?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We don't have time to be doing that.[%p]
