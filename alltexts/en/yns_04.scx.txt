[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki didn't sound normal on the phone⋯ I should go to the school gate![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki didn't sound normal on the phone⋯ I should go to the school gate![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, it's you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I keep seeing you today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, this is my house.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes⋯that's true. I do remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this guy⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ayumi is at the office at this hour, isn't she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, I seem to be becoming forgetful. Must be my age.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you going somewhere?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'm working out of the office today. I'm meeting somebody.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯ I mean, you're not with Ms. Ichijou today?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]She's my secretary, but she's not with me twenty-four-seven.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Send my regards to Ayumi. I'll be on my way now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's meeting someone, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be that woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Ryuuzouji was headed downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Staying at home won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, where should I go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I somehow managed to come back to my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is waiting at Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I somehow managed to come back to my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was going to Ryuuzouji's mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*shiver* It's a little cold outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I somehow managed to come back to my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back to my house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, she doesn't need to be here at all. I have plenty of ways to contact her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just like last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already late today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I want to take it easy at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm out, then I'm in⋯ What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm in and out too much, Ayumi will notice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯ I managed to get down without alerting Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that cold yet⋯but I'm chilly for some reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whooaa![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eeek, what's wrong, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Oh, uh⋯ I didn't expect to see anyone in the streets at this hour. That's all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, you're a scaredy-cat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Scaredy-cats survive on the battlefield.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What battlefield?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a common saying.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you go downtown?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm, well⋯ I just walked around.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't go wandering around too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is strict about things like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't even go to a hotel with a girl like this.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*flinch* Wh-Where?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you talking about? You're going home, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Oh yeah⋯ Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I nervous about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door. What am I gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I just keep shouting.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you following me? You're like a lost puppy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tell you, this is the entrance to my house.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Right. I don't even want to think about that right now.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, you know Takuya's house, Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio is such a dummy.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No. I don't know. Not at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, Mio wouldn't know where my house is.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But she just said⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I basically just told her, 「this is my house.」[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh yes. I heard him say that, and I thought, oh really? Is that right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How impressive![%p]
[name]Takuya&Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]This is the first time Takuya and Miss Mio have agreed on something. You were completely in sync![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, you two fight like cats and dogs, but miracles can happen.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-That's not what that was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're overthinking it, Yuuki. Mio just has a bad attitude.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What did you say?! That's like the pot calling the kettle black.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are we talking about kitchenware?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why don't you ask yourself that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm, what's going on? Maybe you two really don't get along.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Th-That's not it. I was just correcting him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I was just correcting Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem⋯(This is stupid. I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your lips are red.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*flinch*)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha ha ha⋯ It's from the red ginger that came with my beef bowl today. What, do you want some too?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Let's go, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay uh⋯we'll be going then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First I'll wipe this lipstick off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like they went downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house is near there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I was supposed to meet someone at this hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door. Hey, why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I was supposed to meet someone at this hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door. I can see my house right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Call me Takuya.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]All right, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you're done with classes for the day?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes. I'm on my way home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna wears a uniform when she goes to school⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But right now she's in regular clothes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be nosey about it.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I thought you were taking remedial classes too, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I send my double to school.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't think about it too much. So, you wanna come in for a cup of tea?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house you see here happens to be my house.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Thank you for asking. But I'll pass today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Where do you live, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I live on the other side of the city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the Heights, where you can see the whole city?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Somewhere near that area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Well, I'll be going then, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She always wears a uniform to school. So where did she go today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she was coming from the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi's gonna come home late again today. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door. What should I do?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Excuse me, do you live here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh, I feel like I've seen her before.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, you were in front of Geo Technics and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, right. You were arguing with the guard. You're name is⋯umm⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's Kaori. Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Do you live here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I do.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hmm. Could you be Mrs. Arima's husband?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-H-Husband? No way.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm her son.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Her son? You're pretty⋯umm⋯big and⋯ Maybe you're just tall for your age?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're not blood-relate, so we're not that far apart in age.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Huh⋯ So you're the chief's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, what do you want? I think Ayumi went out.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh no, I was just checking where she lives. *smirk* I'm surprised she has such a cute son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think cute is ever a good compliment for a man.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh my, you're even cuter when you get angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* Bye now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was with that woman? Maybe she was supposed to meet with Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I feel like I've seen her before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not just in front of Geo Technics today, somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is still out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi probably isn't back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll use this device to find the old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But where should I look?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I search the endless parallel worlds?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be some kind of clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Old man, I'm gonna find you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate is to the right, the left is the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ayumi go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's supposed to be moving between school and the construction site, but I just can't catch her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Am I never going to see her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is probably there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi went back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she's probably home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing just wandering around?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's bright. The sun is strong again today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can go to the school from the corner on the right. Okay, let's get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi is back.[%p]
