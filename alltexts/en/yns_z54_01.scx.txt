[name]Takuya[line]She's not at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's hurry up and look for Celes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing? I told you it's dangerous to walk outside alone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go look for Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever. Let's just go look for Celes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's a small house with just the bedroom and kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be Illia's living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably where she eats and relaxes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some weird plants decorating the windows⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it gonna spit out spores if you touch it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Celes just straightened up the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really clean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing on the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing on the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really clean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A round table with four chairs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are pots and things, but I don't need them right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cups and plates⋯ They have lots of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to be eating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she go outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn! I was so caught up thinking about Illia that I didn't notice her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes! Hey, where are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit⋯it looks like she's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If that's how it is, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like she's come back like that before, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I don't think she's in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way she snuck back in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't hurt to go back to the bedroom.[%p]
