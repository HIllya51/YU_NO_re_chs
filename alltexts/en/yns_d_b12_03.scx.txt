[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, something must've happened to Yuuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I do? What should I do?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Did you find a rocket launcher?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]So, did you find anything⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It won't work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]On second thought, it won't work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There has to be some way, right?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there something I can use to break this thing down?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Did you find anything? A rocket launcher or–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't find a rocket launcher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ Maybe I should try using an item.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yuuki is on the other side of the door.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've gotta do something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's giving me a worried look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. Isn't there something I can do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter how dimwitted he is, he must be worried by now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Of course he's worried. This big, dumb door separated the two of us⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the cave I went through⋯ No one's there, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something must've happened to Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The passage continues on the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something must've happened to Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said a hole opened up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I didn't know this cave would turn out to be so dangerous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my fault if something happens to him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only this door weren't here, I'd be able to go help him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I didn't open this door in the first place–no, if I hadn't brought Yuuki with me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. The more I think about it, the worse I feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could ask myself 「What if?」 all day, but there's no point dwelling on things I can't change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯ It is my responsibility.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuukkkiii![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thanks to the hole, I can barely talk to Yuuki on the other side⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole in the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a small hole, but it's enough to communicate with Yuuki on the other side.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯ What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it all, if only this stupid door wasn't here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't there something I can do?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt it. I can't open it, not with my strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't there some way?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! If only this annoying door wasn't here.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's no use. I doubt you can open it by brute force alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, Yuuki is trapped on the other side of this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a sturdy door⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do as long as I can't find a way to open this door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I said I'd think of something, but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How am I supposed to get past such a sturdy door?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it. Why does this stupid door have to be so strong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way I could break this thing down on my own.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay. I'll think of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around here won't get this stone door open. And Yuuki's not coming back, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my fault that Yuuki is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! I'm such an idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki! If you can hear me, just listen![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get you out of there! Don't lose hope![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to go. That's all I can do right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]While I'm sitting here, Mio might end up in the same situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you worried about Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki! Answer me!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No answer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll try going back to that room.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man⋯ You're the only one I can count on![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. Wait right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do about this stupid door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If I use the Iron Sword, then maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stand back, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aah, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hiya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! Again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow ow ow⋯ I hurt my wrist⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no good. The rock is a lot stronger than I thought.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man. I think we really need that rocket launcher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say dumb stuff like that with a straight face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it! There has to be a way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I can't break the door down, I'll have to open it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Open it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, how did I open it in the first place?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, why didn't I realize this sooner?! You can open it, Yuuki![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What are you saying, Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can open the door.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not strong enough to push it open⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You idiot. Who told you to push it open?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I opened it once, didn't I?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you get it? Just do the same thing I did.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, if you do the same thing I did, then maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh yeah. That's one way to do it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah that might⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, hold up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki! You can't just run off like that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll be right back! First I'll go over there and⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Whoa!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened? Yuuki![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I-It's⋯a hooollleee!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hole? What hole?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I-I'm slipping⋯ I'm gonna faaallll!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki, get it together. What hole?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I-It wasn't here before. B-But⋯ Whaaa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's wrong, Yuuki?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm slipping⋯ I'm gonna faaallll![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay, Yuuki? Yuuki!!![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Yuuki! Answer me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be pissed if you're just messing around! Answer me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're kidding, right? What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! If only this stupid door wasn't in the way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heeey, I promise I won't hit you, so please answer me!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it! What am I going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use my father's letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you expect me to do with this card?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use this medal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna's notebook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This has nothing to do with my current situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like I can use this key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This notebook has nothing to do with this right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Disc doesn't fit here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe if I could come at it from the other side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way a wooden sword could break stone like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only I had something tougher⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tie it up with a rope?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's try taking this seriously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This document doesn't matter⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you expect me to do with this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have I gone mad?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The White Medal⋯ This is no use to me now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Black Medal⋯ It's no use right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only this thing could split a rock in half⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you giving this any serious thought at all?[%p]
