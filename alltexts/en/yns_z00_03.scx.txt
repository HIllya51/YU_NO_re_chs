[name]Takuya[line]Where am I⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Such a big amusement park attraction⋯ This can't be in Japan, right? Haha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this isn't Japan, where am I? I have no idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I can't stay here. Let's go inside that building.[%p]
*scoot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tap tap?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the sound you make when you point your finger, apparently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pointing your finger over there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What can you see?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In front of the rocky mountain far away⋯to the right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I did not notice at first but⋯there's a building.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes, you knew this?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*tap tap*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. You don't have to say anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The fact that there's a building means that there are other people.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if they can't speak either? No way⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can gather information from them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can find out where this is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe I can find the way to go back to Sakaimachi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyhow, if I stay out here like this, I'm going to end up dead⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right, then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to that building you see on the far right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never seen anywhere like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess we could find this much nature preserved somewhere in the world⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, this is not Japan after all?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not Japan⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then where could I be? Another country?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I be in a foreign country?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the rocky mountain on the far right⋯ What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ That's a rocky mountain, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The question is, whether there is such a rocky mountain like that in Hokkaido.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that a⋯sand dune far in the distance?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha, it looks like a desert for some reason, but of course that's an illusion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, this must be an illusion. For sure![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, there are no deserts in Japan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, it is an illusion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This burning sunlight is an illusion and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The slight shaking in the distance is also an illusion⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An illusion⋯ Or is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's investigate it a bit more properly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The forest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, Hokkaido still has this much nature, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. A warm but slightly sweaty climate, as expected in Hokkaido.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees grow thick⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A wide forest continues on the left side⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There seems to be a lot of forests all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there a place like this in Japan?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it a desert?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quite a large one at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I leave the forest, there's just a big desert that continues on and on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From this height, you can see the desert horizon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sand is spread out for at least six or seven miles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sand spreading across miles and miles⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sounds like a desert, doesn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reddish, brownish area I see in the distance⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've seen the Tottori sand dunes in photos, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is much bigger than that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can see the horizon from this height⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does that mean it's definitely a desert?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No! No way! That is just a huge sandbox![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel stupid saying that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is still right next to me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This lady named Celes, she's still right next to me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even when seeing this view, she doesn't look scared⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this landscape familiar to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why are you smiling? Look at that![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See! The forest, the desert, and the rocky mountain![%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't feel anything? A ridiculous place like this is certainly not in Japan![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*flinch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, s-sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right now, for the time being, I understand that it is no use asking you questions.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on, don't you want to know about the building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Shouldn't you look around a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, we just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯all right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to that building⋯[%p]
*scoot*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Coming with me?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your house?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*shakes head*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ As they say, 「In traveling, companionship, in life, kindness.」 Let's go.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who lives here⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I should meet with them and have a talk⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Everything starts from there⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this architectural style?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is⋯some sort of building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like it was built by piling up stones⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's look around more instead of talking to her now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good girl.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Off you go.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*sob*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding. See, good girl, good girl.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Celes[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just wanted to call your name.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she means by her smile.[%p]
