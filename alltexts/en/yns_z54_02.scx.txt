[name]Takuya[line]Celes is in the kitchen washing the nuts I picked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go sneak a little peek.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a little one. And I'll be quiet, so I don't wake her up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's a small house with just the bedroom and kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes, myself, and maybe one more person could live here comfortably.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably where she eats and relaxes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As usual, there's some weird vegetables hanging in the window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why Celes likes them so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is working in the kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't bother her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing on the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing on the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really clean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A round table with four chairs⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are pots and things, but I don't need them right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cups and plates⋯ Lots of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now isn't the time to be eating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes is working right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you have something better to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up?[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop. She's tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Howdy, ma'am![%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*smile*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, keep up the good work.[%p]
[name]Celes[line]*nod*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, outside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't look like Yu-No's in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll have to go outside to look for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No's not in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really don't want to make Celes any angrier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll be quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to the bedroom.[%p]
