[name]Takuya[line]That's my stepmother Ayumi. You got a problem with her?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you doing here at this hour? How's school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't look so worried when you ask. Classes are over for now. Now I can enjoy this beautiful summer vacation till my heart's content.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, but your teacher Ms. Takeda said you still have remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever she says is bullshit.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ms. Takeda said you would say that, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Passing the test is just a matter of numbers. Now, cheer up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, it's not like I'm upset about it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Tests are just for the sake of convenience. I mean, your reputation and personality⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯might score even lower numbers?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's not true. I know that for a fact.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please don't blush and make a passionate speech.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If only you had the eagerness to work hard, you'd do incredible things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would've been funny if you said I'd do terrible things instead.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I heard from Ryuuzouji that one time you were one of the three best students in your year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For some reason I gave into temptation and actually studied.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I thought you'd go down the same path as Koudai⋯your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never planned on that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh boy, she's starting to look sad.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, about your club–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's true: I straight-up quit.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Did you? But you've been practicing it for so long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not like I wanted to. My old man made me join.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing to worry about. It's just what I decided after being at school for this long.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Have you decided what you'll do when you graduate?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I've made up my mind.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really. Well, you're an adult so I'm sure you thought it over a lot. I just don't want you to regret anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right⋯okay then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Actually, a package arrived for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A package? Maybe it's that porno I⋯ Oh! Never mind![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So who is it from?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It didn't say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't say, huh? Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How big is it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Maybe about this big?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Less than a square foot. Okay, it must be that porno I asked Yuuki to⋯ I mean sketching video Yuuki ordered for me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It has a naked art model posing for sketches. It's very artistic.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Mhmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, technically I'm not lying.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's artistic is subjective, and if I want to use that video for sketching, I certainly could.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If that were the case, I could have helped you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All I would have to do is whatever is in the video, right? Wouldn't it be better in the flesh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-In the flesh⋯ Ahaha! Umm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no. I'm going to get a nosebleed or something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If she knew it were a porno, she'd have a stroke!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Chief! Can you come here please?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll be right there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have to get back to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm going to Ryuuzouji's place to discuss the construction expansion, then I'll be back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you going to be late again?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, I'll be home before long. Will you wait up for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*ba bump*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Bye, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A package addressed to me⋯ It must be that thing I asked Yuuki about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go home and check it out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I getting so excited for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't seem like it when I looked at it from the rooftop, but this is a pretty large-scale construction job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought they were doing some geological survey for the company's building expansions.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's supposed to be done in a few days, but the construction is suspended for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Building expansions, huh? Does Ayumi's company make that much money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they do, I wish they'd increase her bonus⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, it won't increase that easily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this is a large-scale construction project.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi said she's like the manager of the construction or something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I really don't want her to get hurt. I hope she'll be okay.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Swimming will be off limits for the time being.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry about that. Shall we play around in the bath wearing our swimming suits instead?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cut it out. I'm not a baby, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Swimming isn't allowed here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means I can't go in the ocean.)[%p]
