[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet night. I can hear the waves whispering far away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strangely chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on, I should hurry to that place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry and check the contents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Ayumi comes home, I won't be able to check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I keep going back and forth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I have to do something like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Once I smelled the salty breeze, I ended up at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's not a gorgeous mansion or anything, but it's plenty for Ayumi and I to live in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll be living with just the two of us for the time being.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For the time being, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For the time being⋯ How long will that be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
