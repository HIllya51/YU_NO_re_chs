[name]Takuya[line]I've never been so hungry before that I couldn't sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I wonder if there's anything to eat in the fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ughh⋯ When you're this hungry, everything starts looking like food.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need something in my stomach.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't eat the bed though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like food's gonna come flying in through the window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about going downstairs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmm, that Monet looks so appetizing⋯ Wait, no no no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't do something about this, I'm going to eat the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go down to the living room, maybe I'll find something to eat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might find something to eat in the fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go downstairs⋯whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm stumbling. Whew, I've never been woozy from being hungry before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should take the stairs carefully.[%p]
