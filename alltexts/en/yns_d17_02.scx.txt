[name]Takuya[line](This is the tapestry Mio was talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man saw this too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are flames everywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could this mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flame is surrounding the people.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder if those people are burning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're definitely suffering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is this image of people suffering some kind of symbol?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes. It means that the humans aren't burning, but they're still suffering.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, I see. It doesn't affect them directly, but the flame is very far-reaching, and it's hard on people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not just a fire. Maybe it's somehow related to the building on the left.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You truly are Dr. Arima's son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please stop talking about my father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people are lined up to go into the flames.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It looks like they're suffering from the heat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a symbol of something more than just burning and suffering.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]A symbol of something more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's light emanating from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what the light is, but⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What could that light be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's a symbol of something.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it were a star, there would be more light shining from it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's around the shining building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Based on the angle, it seems like the light is coming from the building.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The building itself is the source of the light?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The building itself is the source of light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it a searchlight or something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is from 400 years ago. There was no such thing in that era.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's a light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see that. The question is, what kind of light is it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't know. Is it the sun?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one sun.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Maybe it's the moon or stars?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are the sun, moon, and stars coming out at the same time?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I see⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a small tower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of small towers.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder what this is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know. There are several small towers surrounding a large tower.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]They're surrounding it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, what's up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's unbearable.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the entrance to the building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll ask.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this entrance here for?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's⋯probably to get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you do after you get inside?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I-I don't know that much. But there must be some reason for there to be an entrance, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess so. There must be some reason for there to be an entrance.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I wonder what this is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's just what I was thinking.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Is it an entrance to this big tower?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An entrance to the tower⋯ Which means this tower was man-made.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I'm saying that if we consider the possibility of this being man-made, then an entrance wouldn't be so strange.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Of course. Buildings are all man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the tapestry my old man came all the way to see.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It must mean something⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And maybe Mio understood the meaning, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Darn, so Mio understood, but I don't?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh yeah, didn't Mio mention something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think it was some kind of clue.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to remember.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must have mentioned some kind of clue.)
[name]Mio[line]((And that tapestry I saw at Headmaster Ryuuzouji's house⋯ I think that's a clue.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((The problem is the placement of the Twin Boulders. It's too similar⋯))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((The placement of the Twin Boulders⋯))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((It's too similar.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((There's a tapestry with a certain picture on it. Do you know about it?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((It dawned on me when I saw that picture at Headmaster Ryuuzouji's house. Or more like, I was coming closer to believing that theory.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((That tapestry⋯seems like it's been passed down many generations.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((Perhaps the ancient peoples were trying to tell us something.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You were really lost in thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was just wondering why your boobs were in such great shape.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's so dumb. Tell me the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh heh, I think I kind of figured it out.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What Mio wanted to say.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, even though I figured out what Mio wanted to say, that doesn't mean it's the same as facts.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's complicated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it's like this: I understand what Mio is obsessed with, but it might just be a fairytale.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So what is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Crazy is what it is! I'm sure you'll laugh at me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Just tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll tell you⋯but I'm surprised.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, you're not the kind of person who would believe this kind of thing, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's not just Mio. Even your father was interested in this. I want to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Well, don't get your hopes up.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So, how about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go outside first. If we're here too long, the owner might come home.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]All right. I'll walk you to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe Mitsuki is actually interested.)
[name]Takuya[line]Oh wow. Look at the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be dark soon. That's no good.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So how about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on. You just said it. You said you'd tell me out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I guess I did. It's not that big of a deal. It's about that tapestry and⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯*[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*huff⋯*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki. Why are you so out of breath?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-You have to help. It's Miss Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio? What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It seems she ran away from home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-What should I do?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yuuki, tell me everything.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, even Ms. Ichijou is here. I was worried, so I actually just went to Miss Mio's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That huge mansion?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. And the entire house was in a panic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]When I asked what was happening, I heard that Miss Mio left a note⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was in it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯ Supposedly, it said she would be taking a trip for several days.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No way. Is she serious?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should I do? The entire household is in a panic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calm down. She left a note, didn't she? Then she might really be taking a trip.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, people at the house did say her travel bag was gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then that must be it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, apparently a thief broke into Miss Mio's house this morning. I'm worried she's gone because of that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A thief?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I-I mean some kind of violent criminal, not a white-collar criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I get that. A burglar, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes. It seems they broke into her room this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That was me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh boy⋯ I never thought things would turn out this way.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]They said they may contact the police. This is bad.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]But she's only been gone for a couple of hours, right? I don't think they'd list her as a missing person yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe if Mio's father were just a regular business man.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* Oh well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is my fault.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have to find the princess before things get any worse.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's my fault.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's my fault Miss Mio is gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How is it your fault? This is my fault.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why is it your fault, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well that's, ahem⋯ A man has to take responsibility. Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now, we should split up and search for the princess. I have a pretty good idea where she is.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll help, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You too, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, didn't you say you had to be somewhere?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]There's no time for that. Even though I'm just a part-time teacher, she is my student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. You're right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll search the school. She might be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Then I'll search from downtown to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Whether we find her or not, should we meet back here after a little while?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I agree.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]All right, I'll get going. First I'll go to Miss Mio's house again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll search the school and the surrounding area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sounds good.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We'll meet up later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, as for me⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't help but see this as a building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The pointy tower⋯ Huh.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So this building is something based on ancient mythology?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know about that.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It feels Buddhist to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Buddhism, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Indra's light⋯ The arrow of light to destroy the world, unleashed by ⑬akra-dev⑫nam-Indra.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say this thing is 400 years old.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's around The Battle of Sekigahara. The religion of Japan at the time was Buddhism.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't make a snap judgement like that. It's possible that the tapestry itself was imported.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Imported?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean it could have been brought to this samurai mansion 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then we have to expand to a world-wide level.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means we're doomed. At the very least, this isn't a problem we can solve right here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So this was a wasted trip?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. My old man came here to see this picture. And Mio was interested in it, too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be something about it. But I don't know what.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If this were God's punishment taking place in a church⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯then what were these peoples' sins?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe God was just fickle and made people suffer.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hey, don't talk like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? I thought you were an atheist, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's your religion?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I don't subscribe to any particular religion, but I think there is a God.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, that's adorable.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mind you, the gods of ancient times didn't have an ounce of benevolence or love.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You haven't read enough. Most of them meant nothing but fear to humans. Nothing but terror.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should read some mythology. Envy, hatred, fear⋯ The ancient gods had a lot of human qualities.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It sounds like you know quite a lot, but only about this particular subject.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say it like that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a building.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Like one of those church steeples you see in Europe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A church, huh? It actually does look religious.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]If that's the case, this might be a religious painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So is that the light of the Gods?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]And to punish humans⋯ How about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Punish humans?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's not how it feels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Punishment⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a sublime painting on the tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look closer at the individual objects.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the word sublime really suits this.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It didn't seem like he liked this very much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right about that. With a painting like this decorating your living room, you'd lose your desire to eat, sleep, or even have sex.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You didn't need to add that last bit, but I guess you're right. However, it looks like he changed his mind when Dr. Arima paid a visit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dr. Arima, my old man?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. Your father was interested in that painting. And it seems Ryuuzouji became strangely interested, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, how should I put it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a painting from a dream.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. According to Ryuuzouji, this painting⋯can I call it that? It has been in this house for a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A long time?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I think it's safe to assume it's been here as long as this house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means it's been here for 400 years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any items to use here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time.[%p]
