[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So this is Ryuuzouji's courtyard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's purely Japanese.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like a lot of care is put into it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are some parts that are neglected.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why did you stop all of the sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯ What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Are you interested in this garden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I just⋯ How do I put it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's quite a big difference between the places that are well taken care of, and the places that aren't.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're very observant, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I got it from my old man, I think.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji used to call in a gardener to take care of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, that's right. I have to go get permission from his mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His mother⋯ You mean that old lady?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's not nice to say. I just have to let her know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll wait here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]His mother sometimes disappears. She's not coming out now, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll be right back. Wait right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
