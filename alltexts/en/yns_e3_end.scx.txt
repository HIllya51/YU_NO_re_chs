A few years later⋯[%p]
At first, Kanna was supposed to come live at my place, but for some reason I ended up living at hers.[%p]
I guess it's only natural to want to live somewhere convenient alongside the girl you want to be with.[%p]
It was tough breaking the news to Ayumi, but now I commute to school almost every day from Kanna's apartment.[%p]
She got a job working in an office now. People with experience sure are different. They go right out into the world.[%p]
Experience, huh⋯[%p]
I know that Kanna has been alive for decades already.[%p]
And that Kanna's mother is from another world.[%p]
Perhaps she was someone I knew at some time⋯[%p]
But one simple picture won't give me any proof of that. Some things you just have to leave to the imagination.[%p]
Age isn't a problem for us. The issue is how we feel.[%p]
And thankfully, Kanna's and my feelings are perfectly matched.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaah, this croquette is so good![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe, stop exaggerating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, there aren't many girls that can make croquettes from scratch these days.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Well, I'm not from these days⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? You look pretty modern around here.[%p]
*poke poke*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please don't poke my boobs with your chopsticks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, you handled that very calmly. How about this?[%p]
*squeeze*[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please don't grab my shirt with your chopsticks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, still calm.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]What do you want to do today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How about getting frisky in the woods?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Frisky? I don't want to drink.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's whiskey, not frisky.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Tehe, oh that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, you turned me down.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Would you like to go to the park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure! We can get frisky in the park.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Is that all you think about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, it is.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Tehe⋯ Maybe tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, seriously?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You look so sad now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I am sad.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I see it can't be helped. Let's meet at the park tonight then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]When class is over, meet me in Meiunji Park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right! I need to bring something for us to lie on. I also need some clean underwear⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehehe⋯ You put in a lot of effort when it comes to things like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I'd love to get some new underwear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We still have some extra money this month, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Would you mind if I bought some?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna's the one making all the money, but she always asks me if she can spend it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's almost admirable or⋯ Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, how about the stuff I saw in town the other day?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You're still interested in that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup. See through purple with nothing but a single string in the back![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Oh well⋯ Fine, I'll go buy that one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, and remember. You have to wear it tonight.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's so breezy though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like that kind of thing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]There's no use arguing with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You always say that, but you always listen to me. I really like that about you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hehe⋯ Now that I live with you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯you're never lonely?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
How long will we be able to live together like this⋯[%p]
Only God knows.[%p]
The most important thing I can do is live in the moment, as best I can.[%p]
Kanna and I will continue on, hand in hand, living together.[%p]
This is one life I can live happily⋯[%p]
