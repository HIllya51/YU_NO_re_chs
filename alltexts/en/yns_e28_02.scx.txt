[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see any people around at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sign of Kanna, nor that Houjou guy, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone call I received before specified this location.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They have to be somewhere around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it? I heard something just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I heard it come from those bushes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No⋯no!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is Kanna being attacked?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already way past 10 o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From here, it looks like there's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trees grow thick⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a bench, man. No one's sitting here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An unoccupied bench.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A scream like that wouldn't come from the garbage can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A garbage can that might move with the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's just the garbage can moved by the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ D-Don't scare me like that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's inside the garbage can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me check things that should be obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In here? Yeah right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one here. Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would that come from a street lamp?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entire park's only light source.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only other light comes from the moon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lamp. It's dim, but it's turned on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This park has so much greenery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way she climbed up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would the scream have come from there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there. Look, right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Kanna's apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did it come from the house next door?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, the scream came from over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A private residence next to the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the residence next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not the fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fountain at the center of the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They wouldn't be in the water, would they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A scream like that wouldn't come from the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My gut feeling tells me it's over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty cloudy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark. I wonder what time it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already past 10 o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to that Houjou bastard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty cloudy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It reminds me of yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When Ryuuzouji aimed that gun at me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, is this really a time for jokes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not an alien, so she's not going to be in the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard a scream just now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where⋯where did it come from?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here at the park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not likely that Kanna or that bastard Houjou are here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is weird. The park is usually filled with couples at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, they have to be somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet park.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are usually a bunch of couples necking behind the bushes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But of course, no one's around tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a bad feeling about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I can't use that item.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you have something better to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! I can't use that there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just give it some more thought.[%p]
