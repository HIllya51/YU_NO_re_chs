[name]Takuya[line]It's an underground passage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are passageways to the front and to the left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Both passageways were dead ends⋯ I should go back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Following this underground passage should take me to the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm not careful, I might slip and fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little wet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there water dripping somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only light. I should use it to proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like I need to worry about this place crumbling down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not even that huge earthquake could cause this place to collapse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still, you can never be too careful. So that's just what I'll be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are boulders blocking the way and I can't go forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are boulders blocking the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if the earthquake caused this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go to left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Left, okay. Wait, what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's blocked by boulders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All because of that massive earthquake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I can't go that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I can't do much hanging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guess I'll go back⋯[%p]
