[name]Takuya[line]The coastline is under construction.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]*sigh* You never know when an accident might happen again.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]I applied for the job because of the good pay, but man was that a mistake.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Hey, this is just between you and me, okay?[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]They call these insulated uniforms but they're just construction clothes coated with vinyl.[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]Can this really protect us against lightning?[%p]
[name]Constr. Worker[line]I don't care how good the pay is. My life is more important.[%p]
[name]Constr. Workers[line]*sigh* I should head out early today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't seem like it when I looked at it from the rooftop, but this is a pretty large-scale construction job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought they were doing some geological survey for the company's building expansions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Building expansions, huh? Does Ayumi's company make that much money?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If they do, I wish they'd increase her bonus⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like this is a large-scale construction project.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That lone mountain I can see in front of me is a famous spot in Sakaimachi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only a few hundred feet high. It's a bit of a stretch to call it a mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone in this town calls it 「Triangle Mountain.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Triangle Mountain」 is just its nickname. Its real name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It got its name from the shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really does look like a sword.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of theories and legends about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The locals around here say the recent lightning accidents were caused by the wrath of the guardian deity that protects Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A warning against the destruction of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of plausible things about that rocky peak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That building up on the hill is Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be more precise, it's a building owned by Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a research company that studies the land and minerals. I don't know the specifics though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi works for them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics is the one doing all that construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they're really going to expand the building that far⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Geo Technics, the company Ayumi works for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That weirdo Toyotomi is in the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should avoid going there today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The staircase on my right will take me to Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to go back there now. I want to go home and watch that video lickity-split.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My house is the opposite direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it, I somehow lost track of that lady in a tight outfit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She certainly had my curiosity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that package waiting for me has me even more curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi said she'd be home kinda early, so I should watch that video ASAP.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like swimming in the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First of all, there's construction going on. Second, I don't have swimming trunks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I can't swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean I can't swim, per se, just that I won't swim right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I can't swim here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I explaining myself to anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not allowed to swim here.[%p]
