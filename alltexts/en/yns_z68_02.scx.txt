[name]Takuya[line](Dammit⋯my surprise attack plan completely failed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, whatever. There are other ways⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But this woman in front of me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They called you a priestess just now.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you the priestess?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Does that concern you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you're the priestess who'll have God descend upon her to save Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Yes. That is my direct order from the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes, the priestess before you, is dead. You know that, don't you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I have heard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, next thing. Celes didn't have an heir. Yet here you are, claiming to be the new priestess.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you think that's a little strange?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]It is my direct order from the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see, so the God-Monarch commanded it.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know what I think? I think it doesn't matter to the God-Monarch who the priestess is, as long as there is one still alive.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm saying that the God-Monarch lied to you. He's using you to control the people.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're just a woman to be sacrificed in the name of the God-Monarch's control. Think about it.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]The God-Monarch⋯is not as you say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so? Then tell me something that will refute what I said.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]That is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one can inherit the position of priestess, yet here you are. The God-Monarch doesn't care who the priestess is. You're replaceable.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]No! You're wrong, I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm right. Face it: the God-Monarch is lying to you.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Priestess, no need to listen to this fool![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These guys⋯always getting in my way.)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]What are these lies you spew from your mouth?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm telling the truth. What do you say, priestess?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Silence! There is no reason for me to bring you before the God-Monarch. We are going to end this right here⋯[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]What happened?![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]A-An earthquake! It's the wrath of God![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Nice, this is my chance!)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Graah! Get him! He's running away![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Errraaahh! The shaking is too much![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Everyone, retreat![%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]The wrath of God is upon us!!![%p]
[name]Royal Guards[line]Retreat⋯retreeeeattt!!![%p]
[name]Woman[line]We shall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯bring him to the God-Monarch. Once there, he shall be executed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You sure? You don't want to ask me about that woman, Amanda?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I have no need. We shall capture her and give her the same punishment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did I read this situation wrong?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I don't do something, they'll kill me like a dog.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Guards! Take this man and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, hold on![%p]
[name]Woman[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one thing I want to talk about. Is that okay?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You have no right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're going to kill me either way, right? You can listen to a dying man's last wish, can't you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]So be it. Speak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, it all starts now.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Strange⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I feel like I've seen you before⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a coincidence. I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's no way I would forget someone as beautiful as you.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I don't remember⋯ Where could we have met?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't remember either.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like Celes, but it's not her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't talk much, and she's looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She thinks she knows me.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't really seem like a good time to talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why are we staring at each other like this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a quiet town.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did Amanda escape?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is such a quiet town.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have Royal Guards surrounding me and a woman with a sword pointed at my face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This woman right here is supposed to be the priestess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's wielding a sword, though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That face⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks sort of like Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's like a more stern version of Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that because she's a priestess, too?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯ I feel like I've seen her somewhere before.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You were staring at my face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just enchanted by it.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Celes?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, wait. She looks like Celes, but it's not her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who could she be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This woman before me⋯is the priestess?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The priestess that's going to perform the ritual?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I move an inch, that sword will go right through me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit⋯ This is nerve-racking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's got it pointed at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My surprise plan has completely failed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's dressed like a knight.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this woman really the priestess?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her outfit doesn't seem very priestess-like.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems more like the knight, Illia, than she does Celes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks more like a warrior than a priestess.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should leave it alone⋯for now.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You seem quite restless. Better not try anything funny.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey now, if I take a step forward that sword will go right into my head.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to think before I act.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She was even kind enough to warn me not to do any funny business.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to her advice.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You should refrain from any strange movements. It's for your own good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Apparently, yeah.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You should refrain from any strange movements. It's for your own good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So she says.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Do you really wish to fight me here and now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not particularly. I only fight battles I can win.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Very wise. However, you shouldn't expect to be winning any battles today. You cannot overcome me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so? But a grand slam coming from behind to win the game is the best part of baseball, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What strange words you speak.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Stop it. For your own good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's warning me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those guards behind her look like an army of ants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just about a few dozen. I might still have a chance against them.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Are you saying you have the confidence to go up against dozens of men?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd say I'm half-confident, half-scared. You wanna see?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]⋯[%p]
