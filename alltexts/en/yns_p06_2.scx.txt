[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Mitsuki is looking for me.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I already told you yesterday. Huh, you weren't listening?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Okay, one more time. Once the main story starts, talking to me is a good idea.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Huh, how is it good?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Seeing is believing. Make sure you talk to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in front of the bulletin board now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Talk to me once the main story starts.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Oh, hi.[%p]
[name]Student[line]You came all the way to talk to me, so I'll tell you something good.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Once the main story starts, talking to me might be a good idea.[%p]
[name]Student[line]What? You don't know what the main story is?[%p]
[name]Student[line]You'll know if you just keep playing the game.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Ah, my remedial classes are finally over. Now my summer's just the ocean and girls in bikinis![%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Oh, right. Geo Technics is doing construction on the coastline, aren't they?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]People are saying that the company's management is sloppy. Given that all these accidents keep happening, there's going to be a protest soon.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]A summer without swimming in the ocean. That Geo Technics is a real pain in the ass.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I wonder what's going to happen from now on.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]That's right, Ms. Mitsuki was just in a car with Headmaster Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]Huh, you knew? Oh well.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]Huh? You want to know if I've seen Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]No, I haven't. I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]But I did hear that Ms. Ichijou resigned as a lecturer here.[%p]
[name]Female Student[line]I'm sorry, I haven't seen Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's main hall is open all the way to the third floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was built in hopes to foster open minds in the students.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air conditioning works well. It's really open and feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Taking a left at the hallway ahead takes us to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Taking a right at the intersection? I wonder what's that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I actually don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the hall isn't helping anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are still some students left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're probably all in afterschool clubs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still see students here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]â‹¯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably by some famous artist and normal people don't understand it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see the point of art that normal people can't understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I don't understand this art.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. My remedial classes are over so I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear Mitsuki wants to talk to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should look a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I turn left at the intersection, I'll arrive at the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try that way.[%p]
