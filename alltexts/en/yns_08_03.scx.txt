[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the calendar won't make Mitsuki appear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm much more interested in the girl above the numbers though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I even wrote a note to her, but Mitsuki isn't showing up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. I'll write, 「Hurry up, Mitsuki.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I turn this, the door should open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not really something that needs explaining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A doorknob. Not a door Bob.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's Bob?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at a cup won't make Mitsuki appear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cup. The teachers must be using it to drink stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder which one Mitsuki used. *slurp slurp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Mitsuki could fit in here, that would be pretty impressive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way Mitsuki is waiting for me in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's such a prankster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here. Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lamp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lamp that you can bend and turn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bunch of notes on it.[%p]
「Going back another 400 years ago, in 400 A.D. Japan⋯」[%p]
「We know of a tribe who worshipped the God-Monarch and conquered the native Japanese peoples.」[%p]
「This history has been concealed, but I believe that without this tribe's influence, Japan never would have been unified.」[%p]
「Some say the people of this tribe were the Celestials. I call them Dela.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I heard a voice.[%p]
[name]Voice[line](Yes. Sure.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I hearing things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just hearing things. I must be getting old.[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line](That's what I think.)[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line](Hm, understood.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There it was just now. I didn't imagine that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it was coming from the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I think I heard a man's voice, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I have some time, so I'll read a little more.[%p]
「Then, in 1600 A.D., we know that the Edo Shogunate was established.」[%p]
「Ieyasu Tokugawa is well known for his victory at the battle of Sekigahara, but there was an advisor shadowing him who doesn't appear in history books.」[%p]
「This was occurring 400 years before the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1200 A.D. all the way back to 800 A.D.」[%p]
「According to history books, the Heian capital was moved in 800 A.D. As a result, other events occurring around the same time are viewed with a low priority.」[%p]
「However, the sitting Emperor Kammu and many of his most competent people were aliens.」[%p]
「It isn't recorded by history, but the actions of these aliens were pivotal in realizing the transfer of the capital. We need to keep this in mind.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man believed that theory. He was convinced Japanese culture was shaped by aliens from some distant place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like he was ostracized from a lot of intellectual circles for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It doesn't look like Mitsuki's here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At least the old man's book is good for killing time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just skim for a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This text has a lot of problematic arguments.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He wasn't very open, so I guess he wrote abrasive things on purpose. Here's some.[%p]
「It's not an exaggeration to say that Japanese history is a sequence of revolutions and transitions. But I would like to venture a theory here.」[%p]
「This theory is in direct opposition to the theories written in current texts. But I do not believe those conventional theories to be fact.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stuff like this is why the older historians always berated him.[%p]
「I will venture a theory. Every 400 years throughout Japanese history, there is a revolutionary change.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. This was the old man's pet theory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's in his book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called 「A Book of Confounding History.」 It's my old man's work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This theory challenged the accepted history of Japan, so it was often criticized at academic conferences.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe Mitsuki used this as a textbook for her class.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was interesting though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing's out of print, so it's pretty hard to get your hands on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of papers here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my old man's work, 「A Book of Confounding History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I could read this to kill time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A memo board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are notes and schedules on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks messy, but these things are pretty convenient.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's basically night now. Mitsuki's late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already getting dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at that chair makes me want to sit in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The teachers use these chairs, I bet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should sit down and read some papers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A desk. Surprisingly, I've studied here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if they have any meetings here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I remember studying with Mitsuki here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish staring at the light would make Mitsuki magically appear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Mitsuki will come from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The blinds are shut to block the setting sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already night, so I don't mind opening it. I don't need to though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A vent⋯for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she came from here, I'd be pretty impressed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sprinkler. I better not hold a lighter up to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I don't think it's too bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, who's that stud in the mirror?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last time I said that, Mitsuki kept asking me, 「Where?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It may be a locker, but I don't know if I'm locked and loaded.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh heh! Here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a change of clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bookshelf filled with specialized books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but specialized books in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could kill time by reading a book.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Mitsuki's in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really a good idea to be looking there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard something outside. Is it Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This room sure is a mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the teachers hang out, so they could keep it a little cleaner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, someone's in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it's Mitsuki, why doesn't she come in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We agreed to meet in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go see what's going on in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll leave the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I need to see Mitsuki first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Mitsuki hasn't shown up yet.[%p]
