[name]Takuya[line]That door leads to the history research lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They call it a research lab, but that's just where teachers hang out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what I'd have to do there, but I guess I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because the last classes before summer vacation ended.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps all the students flew out of the building like bullets?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's because classes are over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't many students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Up goes to the roof, down leads to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't stare at stairs, you use them to go up or down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an emergency exit sticker here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can get outside the school from here, using this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not an emergency right now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should use the stairs instead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That door in front leads to the history research laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what it could be? It could be about so many things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should get moving instead of looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, isn't a teacher calling for me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh wellâ‹¯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, go up to the rooftop?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anything to do up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I've been summoned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what they want with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go there.[%p]
