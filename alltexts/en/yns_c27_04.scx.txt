[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio⋯ She's gone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me everything you know.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder about what Mio said⋯「If my theory is correct, then it begins here.」[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「It begins here.」 So first, I have to be wherever 「here」 is.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The place Mio was talking about⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The shrine at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That must mean the shrine, right?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I went there twice already.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, third time's the charm.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's probably around the Heights here somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, now you're guessing. What's that guess based on?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I was hoping maybe it was something I said, and she was waiting for dusk in the park or⋯somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not a guess. It's just a stupid hope.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, you could say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, if that's the case, then let's split up.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, I'll search around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You should widen the search area, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you telling me to search the entire surrounding area?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, okay. I'll start searching over there.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Got it. We should meet back here after a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe Miss Mio is waiting for me⋯ No, of course she isn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That history fanatic sure is a lot of trouble.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well. I'm sure it's nothing bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I have to look for Ayumi too. I have to be positive. It's two birds with one stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what happened after that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio was doing her best to investigate, and that was great, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she investigating?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Um, you know that boulder with the writing on it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, what about it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She was looking closely at that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it was something your average college girl could understand, the scholars wouldn't be having so much trouble with it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, Miss Mio wasn't trying to read the writing. She said that wasn't the point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Reading the writing wasn't the point?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She was very passionate in her investigation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does that mean?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Get to the point.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She was putting some serious effort into investigating, then I sort of thought⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I see. And you went and said what you were thinking.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]*gasp* How did you know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never mind. Keep going.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I thought that Miss Mio would be fine if I wasn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you said that to her?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh⋯ I said, 「Why don't you stop doing that stupid stuff, and we can go to a caf⑮?」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe you're still alive.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, it wasn't that bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The problem came next⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What problem?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I said, 「Takuya could figure that out for you.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! I can't believe you said that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I only said that because I know Miss Mio has a lot of respect for your father, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((This isn't Takuya's business. We can do it ourselves.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((Oh, I wish that was the case.))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((⋯))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((But the Boss Man could, um⋯ It wouldn't be too far off to say that he could maybe point us in the right direction.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why were you talking like a politician? Speak plainly.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh well, when I blurted that out, Miss Mio got upset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she got upset that easily, I wouldn't have to try so hard.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not as practical as you, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway. So what happened after that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((I see. All right. Thanks for today, Yuuki.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((Wh-When you say thank you, Miss Mio⋯))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((I was thanking you for coming with me. I'm going home.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((Huh? Are you really going home?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((No. I'm just going back to get ready. If my theory is correct, it begins here.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((It begins here?))[%p]
[name]Mio[line]((I don't need Takuya. I want to do this myself.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((Hey, wait a minute!))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And that's what happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]When I went to Miss Mio's house, she was already gone. We missed each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say she's missing, but it's only been a few hours, right? She'll make her way back home soon.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She's not a stray cat. There was a note left in her room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A note?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah, a note. You know, that thing people use to write things down⋯ Whoa! Why the fist?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was written in the note?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I asked the people at the house, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She said she was going on a trip for about a week.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I know. She went somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is, where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The secret of Triangle Mountain⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I did speak to her in the hall at school this afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she say something?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hold me tight–Whoa! I-I was lying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]She said she made a new discovery at the Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she did say something about that. She said something about you two making a new discovery at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yep. Lots of scholars have theories about that place, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I guess.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio is very intrigued by that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, Mio's always been a history fanatic.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Do you know a lot about Miss Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That doesn't matter. So, what happened?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, right. Miss Mio said there was a huge secret hidden there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I honestly wasn't sure if I believed it or not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, the only people who'd believe a story like that are Mio and my old man.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]When I spoke to her in the hall today, she said something about going to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, she did say that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I went with her to Triangle Mountain after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](To Triangle Mountain?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right. I don't want to know about your wig.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, it's not a wig.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wigs these days can't be told apart from real hair.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But this is my real hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems suspicious to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]There's nothing suspicious about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's your trademark, that hairpin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet you look like a cue ball under that thing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He doesn't seem as happy as usual.)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have your hands in your pockets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means you don't care much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have your hands in your pockets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you carrying something dangerous on you?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No need to worry. I'm not holding anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody knows what those fingers are up to.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm not doing anything.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's just a hoodie, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's your trademark. Always wearing the same hoodie.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I have a few different ones that are all the same design.[%p]
