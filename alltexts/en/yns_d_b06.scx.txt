[name]Takuya[line]The left path is a dead end with a rock blocking the exit.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]If we go to the right, it leads to another fork.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Which way should we go?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'll leave it all to you, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looking at it another way, he means he takes no responsibility.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well, I'll decide.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]The path splits off⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A fork in the path, eh?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Which way should we go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
