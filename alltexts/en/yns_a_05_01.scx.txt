[name]Takuya[line]Is there no end to this path?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somehow, I can tell that I'll still be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still damp⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing out of the ordinary here, other than the dampness⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty damp⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be from the water droplets dripping down from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see, it's too dark⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check where the flashlight is pointing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I guess I should keep moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ Heading back after coming this far?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, really, I don't need to use any items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to use items right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's time to move forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hold on⋯ I can't use that right now.[%p]
