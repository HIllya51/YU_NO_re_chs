[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Mio isn't inside the school?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No luck?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah⋯ Whew, this school is pretty big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to search around here anymore.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to look in places Mio's likely to go.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm, somewhere Shimazu goes⋯ Maybe the bathroom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Everybody has to go there eventually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll leave checking the bathroom to you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, I'll do that. If I find Shimazu in the bathroom⋯ Oh, look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at what?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Where?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I found it in the lab. They're the reference books I lost.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This is really important to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay⋯ Great.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can tell you're very happy for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? I can't help it.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Geez, Shimazu is a pain in the ass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is being a pain in the ass just part of the princess package?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't boys think that kind of thing is cute?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow. That's pretty harsh coming from you.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't freak me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dark.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't find her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Same.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How about Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He might find her in the city.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, then let's meet at the school gate in a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She is not in the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What about you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm⋯ I'll search in and around the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Mio isn't inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like there's no one here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Mio, and standing with her is Yuuki.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like they're talking about something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I never thought things would turn out this way.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It's fine. I'm sure any suspicion of you will be lifted soon enough.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's no time to be worrying about that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Then what is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't believe Arima would do such a thing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, isn't it a fact? You said so in the main hall just now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, but⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]He's that kind of guy.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]He's probably laughing at your misfortune right now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No⋯ He's not like that. Sorry, I didn't mean to yell.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's okay.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I really don't think Arima would do something like that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why not? I don't think anyone would do that kinda thing besides Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I guess, but I just don't think Arima is the kind of person that would do that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's why I'm in shock.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You were just blind to it, Miss Mio. You've been chasing an illusion that just doesn't exist.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*sniff* You're probably right⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Try to cheer up, okay? You can rely on me in times like this.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Thanks. It's so unfair that you're nice now after how I've treated you⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sorry. I know how you feel for me, but I just need some time to think⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I get it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm thinking about studying abroad.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]My father brought it up to me recently. He really has perfect timing. It's almost unbelievable.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]B-But, you never mentioned anything like that before⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know. I never intended on doing so until now, but after all of this⋯ It may have pushed me over the edge.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Pushed you over the edge⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Thank you, Yuuki, for giving me strength. You're the only one concerned about me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, I⋯you know⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I guess this is my last week here in Sakaimachi⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You're leaving the country in a week?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, and I want to get some things done before I go.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's something I need to make sure of concerning Sword Cape. I want to fulfil my final bit of intellectual curiosity.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm going home now.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Miss Mio! Actually, I⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well I just⋯no, never mind.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh, what's wrong, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]See you around.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, this can't be happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So Mio is leaving in a week.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit, I can't believe she's going to leave before I resolve things with her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Were you watching this whole time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Yuuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He left. Yuuki must have complicated feelings right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see Mio again and talk to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she wants to study abroad, I have no right to stop her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'd be really disappointed in myself if I didn't solve this misunderstanding before she left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll need to have a serious talk with her about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just glancing around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit. If I know her, she definitely got the wrong idea about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor. I can see the laboratory door in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Someone is standing there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I have to hide?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, I guess it's pretty suspicious that I'm hanging around the school this late at night.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But still⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who would be here this late?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A man and a woman.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The man in front. It's Ryuuzouji. That's strange at this hour.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And that woman talking to him⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is she? I think I know her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm. I can't remember.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is that woman at school? And why is she talking to Ryuuzouji?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't make sense.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So that means I can proceed?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes. Things have been postponed⋯ However, it should still be at that place.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]My my, aren't you being vague.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It can't be helped, given the circumstances.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm just doing my job, so I won't ask for your reasons⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is that the obligation of the mass media? Hmm, how commendable.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. The people have a right to know.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Plus, your name becomes more well known.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's inevitable that people who are good at their job become more well known. I'm not doing this for my own benefit.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I know. I'll consider it carefully.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thank you kindly, Mr. Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't just call out to them like this.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]So, just what are your plans?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's not something you need to know.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But that makes me more interested. It's not realistic for you to talk about economics.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If it's not for profit, then perhaps it's simply academic curiosity?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's best you don't go after it. For the both of us.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* I'll keep that in mind. By the way⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What will you do about him?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Ah. He was a very ambitious young man.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Mhmmm, but without his cooperation, we won't achieve what we're trying to do.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, that means we can't treat him very poorly.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, as long as I can fulfill my duty to the people, my lips will remain sealed.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Plus your reward.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Of course. I'm a professional, so I don't work for free.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]All right. We'll talk again if anything happens.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And one more thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It seems you've hired someone other than myself.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]And what is your concern with that?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't want them getting in the way of my work.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]There's nothing for you to worry about. I'm just having them follow Koudai's tracks.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A private detective?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing so serious. He's just a petty local investigator who specializes in backgrounds and affairs. You're in an altogether different class.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's my policy to not look down on any helping hand. He too can be useful.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Indeed⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh shit, they're coming this way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I better hide!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Please don't see me, please don't see me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯why do I even need to hide in the first place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't done anything wrong! At least, not today⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Regardless, I shouldn't have to sneak around like a criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, it wasn't exactly the situation to just pop out and say 「hello.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji and that lady⋯ I think her name's Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell were they talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The book I'm after is over there. Let's hurry up and get this over with.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's you, Mio. You scared me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's my line. What are you doing here so late?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯wanted to see you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How much have you researched Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That again? Aren't you interested in anything else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Figures.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would that make you upset?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're interested in Triangle Mountain and so am I. What's so strange asking about it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's⋯not strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, so?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with her?)[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Oh, and what are you two doing here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That voice belongs to⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heyya, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mmm, you two seem to get along well. Am I interrupting?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I was just about to go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Looks like you have something to talk about with Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's she so upset about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Are you stupid? It's obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯ PMS?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me that. What are you doing here this late, anyway?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Me? Just cleaning up after remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cleaning up?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right, since you've been skipping classes you wouldn't know that I'm actually teaching a history class over the summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, really? You're teaching a remedial classes, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh, don't call me that. You shouldn't be referring to me by my first name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]She seems like the type to get easily hurt. I think she was angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then don't come around while Mio and I are in the middle of a conversation.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why? Uhm⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why should I have to be careful around her, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well that's because⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting tough.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]So, it's been a while. Can we talk for a bit?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Watching her go, hmm? Let me guess, you can't get her off your mind⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like that! I'm just worried about her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mhmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what did you want to talk about?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Why don't we go sit in the lab and talk?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, but I'm pretty busy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You little liar. You were just hanging around looking like you had nothing better to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's so difficult.)
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe. It's been a while since the last time we were alone in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah, that's true.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]How about a seat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Then don't mind if I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-Nothing⋯never mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is my heart beating really fast?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The corridor is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think remedial classes are over for the day.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yeah, I was⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a weird way to respond.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, I mean⋯ You were just talking with Miss Mio in the lab, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, yeah. I was. Did you see us?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I did, but it didn't seem like the right time to just go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was only returning her notebook that she dropped. We didn't talk about anything else.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]R-Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. She said thanks for sitting in class for her, too.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]D-Did she? Miss Mio is so kind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Remedial classes are already over, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, thanks for all your work.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Unfortunately I was found out on the very last day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For sitting in for me?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, for Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, for her. That's good to hear. Wait, were you really sitting in for Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Of course. I tried my best to answer roll call in the cutest voice I could.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dumbass. Your cute voice sounds like a cawing crow.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's so mean. I had some confidence in my voice. Just a little.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about your punishment? Aren't you going to get in trouble?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I might have to stay after classes end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh yeah, where did Miss Mio go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she said she needed to research more stuff. She might have gone to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I see. Thanks, I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Boss Man?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What now⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You don't have any special feelings for Miss Mio, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I have feelings⋯for Mio?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio is just a classmate to me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm relieved to hear that. To be honest, I was worried you might be madly in love with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Now, I've really got to get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be what it feels like when parents try to cover up having sex while kids are in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
