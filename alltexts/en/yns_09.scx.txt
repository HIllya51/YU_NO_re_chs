[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I somehow stopped the first blow!)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Time to die![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay, I blocked the second hit!)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Time to die![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But no matter how many times I block her, Mitsuki will keep attacking me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It isn't going to solve the core problem.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't just beat the shit out of her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I supposed to do?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to think this through⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Time to die![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh shit, she's gonna connect!)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you doing?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What the heck are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* You're such a careless boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe you hit Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If I hadn't, things wouldn't have ended well for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have a point⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* I told you to be wary of her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Niarb disorder is not a normal mental state. She's calmly confused.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calmly confused?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tch.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this disorder stuff you're talking about anyway? Is that some kind of medical jargon?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah, pretty much. The disorder occurs when something is very strongly suggested to them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Power of suggestion? Isn't that like hypnotism?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's not quite the same. It's when a person's consciousness is brought down to certain brain wavelengths.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, it wouldn't hurt to just think it's like hypnotism.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you just said it was different.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It'll be a lot faster to think of it as hypnotism for someone as slow as you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make fun of me. It might not look like it, but this one time I got really into this huge medical text and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Help me out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We can't just leave her here on the floor, can we?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right. Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's been out cold on the floor this whole time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It was Ms. Eriko that hit her though.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No complaining, mister. We'll talk about it later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Everything is fine for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is fine. I have no idea what's even happening.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm sure you don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What on earth is going on?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I doubt you'd believe me, or even understand it if I told you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You need to go home now. Go home, get some sleep, and forget all about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How the hell do you expect me to do that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Because you have to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you going to do then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Depends on what you're gonna do⋯ Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I have⋯things I need to take care of. Or maybe I should say, things I need to check on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you going back to the mansion?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No comment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, I have a right to know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was going through Mitsuki's head before?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, don't you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's no use telling you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How would you know without telling me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I just know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're saying I can't understand it?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly. Judging from your intelligence, I'd say it's far beyond your scope of comprehension.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph. You make me sound like some kind of ape.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Leave Ichijou there. I'll take care of her later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, do you expect me to just obey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, wait Ms. Eriko![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it, I'm gonna call the cops![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, did that catch her attention?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll call the cops myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm all confused right now, so I might run to the police station and tell them all sorts of stuff.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look kind of scary.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you care so much? It doesn't even have anything to do with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes it does.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Because you're close with Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe. Knowing stuff about Ryuuzouji will help me too, you know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]How so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well, because⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You wouldn't understand.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to tackle you or something.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe, now you're back to yourself. Oh well. Just follow my orders.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Where to?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The headmaster is out today. I want to go check out that mansion while he's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We'll contact the police when we're done with that. What do you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I say? You haven't even told me anything yet![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay, let's go to the headmaster's mansion then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, now? Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So selfish. I bet you're blood type O.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm a type A.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting weird.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Going to Ryuuzouji's mansion with Ms. Eriko?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could be there?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph, I see. So it was under those circumstances.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I put Mitsuki on the bed. Is she going to be okay?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Probably.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Probably? Aren't you the school physician?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]School physicians don't know everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as her life isn't in danger⋯ Anyway, we need to call the police.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯we can't just leave that old lady's body lying there.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmph⋯yeah, that'd be bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, a person is dead.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I didn't say we wouldn't call the police. It's just a bit too soon right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You've been making that face for some time now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course I have. What the hell are you doing?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's your turn now, Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What, to carry Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you explaining some things. I told you everything, so now it's your turn.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, I guess so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki's Voice[line]Ahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It sounds like Ichijou's in pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Mitsuki. She's moaning in pain again. It's been going on for a minute.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She's fine. As long as she stays still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You call that fine? She sounds like she's in a lot of pain.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hehe⋯worried about her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Headache medicine should work well for a Niarb disorder but⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We're all out of headache medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]All right, I guess I can go get some at the local pharmacy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The local pharmacy?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's only ten minutes away. I'll be right back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell kind of school infirmary is this? You're entirely out of headache medicine?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Take care of Ichijou, will you? Be very careful with her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. She's not hurt that bad, but her condition is not looking good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take care of her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ouuaahh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki looks like she's in so much pain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's in the bed where I left her. I should go check on her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, I'm coming in.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks terrible. Look at all that sweat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko's first aid is pretty good though. Well, she is the school physician after all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like she's calmed down a bit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are clothes left on the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said something about night shift, but where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sad, but relieved at the same time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She really is like a butterfly though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are clothes left on the chair again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not molting or something, is she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought she was just at the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said it was some kind of regular staff meeting, but that seems suspicious to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yo! How ya doin'?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Is that Jiro from the sushi spot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's Jiro?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Just a guy at this place I go to all the time. Enough about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Man, she really is weird.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Looks like remedial classes ended without a hitch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, and it looks like I'll pass.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]As your homeroom teacher, I'm relieved to hear that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then how about a thank you kiss⋯ Muah![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I can give you a thank you iron fist if you'd like.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wouldn't put it past her.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, what are you doing in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm? Oh, right. I wanted to talk about last night.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't tell me you forgot?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, I haven't forgotten. When we were in front of the headmaster's mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, good. I was thinking for a minute it might have been a different Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, just talking to myself.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I'm not careful, she'll think I'm a creep.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, she might already think that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come to the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh boy, she's gone again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I ever going to do with that teacher.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be going then.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What did you even come here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Je t'aime![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You have a lot of time on your hands, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh, I just wanted to see you.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, then why don't I call over your presiding teacher for remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I've got to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is⋯not here.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes I am.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was working in the back. So, what do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, oh yeah. I have a headache.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you can forget it, it can't be that bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well, Ms. Eriko seems busy.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you need something else? I'm busy, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, but my stomach![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Rejected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrm.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, what do you want?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well, Ms. Eriko seems busy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should come back later.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, as usual⋯wait.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Holy crap![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe she was actually here.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you look like your hemorrhoids are flaring up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck are hemorrhoids?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know, the things in your rectum that–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, okay! You don't have to get into the details.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh really. That's too bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the school infirmary, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Ms. Eriko doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here, and neither is Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She was just at the front gate⋯where did she go?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Is that you, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, it's Mio.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You look very disappointed. Sorry I'm not the love you're looking for, Mr. Heartache.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no, I'm letting it show.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What, were you actually looking for someone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I was just thinking that Ms. Eriko isn't here, as usual.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no. Why am I feeling so nervous?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing in the school infirmary, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're hurt, I'll lick your wounds for you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Disgusting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Licking wounds is an instinct. It actually works pretty well.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Of course you'd say that. You survive on instinct alone, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that weird pause?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You seem so confident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know if you don't go to remedial classes, you won't pass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is that right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't believe you. The teachers were really mad, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't worry about that now.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you staring at me like that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You seem like you're in a totally different place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm here, for you and no one else.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like⋯what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's what I'm asking you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could be wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's why I'm asking⋯ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you want to know, anyway? It's none of your business.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I⋯ I know that, but what's the harm in asking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I-I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, whatever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone. She was as irritable as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I say something to offend her though?[%p]
