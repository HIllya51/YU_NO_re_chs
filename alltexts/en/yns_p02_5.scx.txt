[name]Takuya[line]Just a little longer until the ten o'clock appointment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get to that place soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Ayumi put the key to the study?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to look around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to kick that old bastard's ass. Every minute counts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it? I can't get into the study without the key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the key to the study here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi put it away somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get the key to the study next time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now the priority is to go to the place in question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's study is locked, and I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room and my father's study are here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's study is locked, and I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this really the time to be watching TV?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't much time until ten o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the TV has anything to do with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key isn't under the TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! That's nice and cool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do that now. I need to get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The counter has nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I look somewhere else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key isn't on the counter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I don't even have five minutes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It takes three minutes to walk to that place. I have to hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the key's in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to my room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to be there at ten o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost ten. The key can wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. I should bring a flash light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure it'll be useful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The flashlight is on that shelf.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I have the flashlight. Now I need to go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still have some time until ten o'clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look for the key to the study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came out of there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost time. I should hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, maybe Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not comfortable walking into a woman's room uninvited. But it's an emergency. And it's somehow connected to my father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The key might be in Ayumi's room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just pop in for a second.[%p]
