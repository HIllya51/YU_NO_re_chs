[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, her family is looking all over for her. It'd be crazy if she were here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no sign of the panic from before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's people running around inside the gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look kind of panicked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio's house entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet. Maybe it's because it's a rich neighborhood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came back again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I should be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just taking a quick look around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ Looks like Mio's father isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even so, I should keep an eye out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I should be hanging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* Geez, this is just crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should try going to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm supposed to meet Mio there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There might be high voltage electricity running through the top of the wall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall is about one and a half times my height.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It just goes on and on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are all politicians' houses like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard people running around on the other side a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds pretty panicked on the other side of the wall now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But just maintaining it must take a lot of work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Only a pleb would think about stuff like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there's a bunch of big trees growing on the mansion's grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet the cicadas are really loud in the summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The gate is closed up tight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this with my strength alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's closed and won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go to Mio's room like I did last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was really loud when I was here earlier, but it's quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a bunch of people are running around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could they be looking for something?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What? The young lady's travel bag?[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]It's a sports bag⋯ She bought it while shopping recently⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]That means it's true⋯[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]Yes, it appears so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, excuse me.[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]Yes? Ah, are you a guest?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Um, I'm Mio's⋯ I'm Ms. Shimazu's classmate.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh⋯ Are you here to speak to the young lady?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, something like that. It looks like you're in the middle of something?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Yes⋯actually the young lady Mio has⋯[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]That's enough of that talk.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Y-Yes, my apologies![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I'm sorry, the young lady is currently out of the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]If you have a message for her, I can relay it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's fine. I'll call her later.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I don't believe you'll be able to reach the young lady for some time⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]What are you doing? Have you already searched the house?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Coming! I'm sorry, I must be going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That was a big commotion. I wonder what's going on.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Is she over there?![%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]No, she isn't.[%p]
[name]Man's Voice[line]Look carefully. It hasn't been very long yet.[%p]
[name]Girl's Voice[line]Of course⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's a big commotion in the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's even people running around the garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This gate won't open unless I ram a truck into it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A big, thick gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could push and pull, but it won't budge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How am I supposed to get in? There's no doorbell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, even if I'd go there they would just turn me away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The gate, the mansion, even the light bulbs are huge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that bigger-is-better concept, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are light bulbs as big as watermelons on top of the pillars.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's day time now, so the lights aren't on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night, so the lights are on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stately mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio⋯ Isn't she here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not as noisy as when I was here before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It gets noisy, then it gets quiet. What a busy house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they all in a tizzy about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're all running around in a panic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess you get to live in a mansion when you become a well-known person in this town.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mansion that Mio lives in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear that her father's a well-known person in this city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that's why he's the mayor right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it fun staring at the sky?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you staring at the sky?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is blinding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing but a dark sky that could swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe because this a rich neighborhood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I wonder what the commotion inside is about, but staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like Mio's here, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll go back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go over there, I can get back to the Heights.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Waiting for Mio here won't do any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going ahead.[%p]
