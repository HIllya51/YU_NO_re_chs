[name]Takuya[line]It's a steep cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I better do my daily tasks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No issues today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe we should return to the forest soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need anything from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear a faint sound, but it's a very quiet place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's very quiet around here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I listen carefully, there's an underlying low sound coming from below⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That monster who came for Celes⋯
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We haven't seen one ever since that day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I must stay on my toes. You never know when it's going to jump out again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This area might have some clues for me to get back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I come here everyday to observe any abnormalities⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I look down, I feel like being sucked in⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no intention of flying off a cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a sea of clouds below⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Might be a few hundred feet away⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could lie below the sea of clouds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If only I had a looooong rope, then I could go down there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one has a rope that's a few hundred feet long. Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea how tall this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't help but sigh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rocky pillars springing out just like baby bamboo shoots⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how tall that rocky pillar is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Weeds all look the same to me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They all must be different kinds of grass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The grass in the front looks like where I'm standing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't lean over too far⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Nothing notably special today, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Alright, let's go back to the forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's take a look around before we go back to the forest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. We've come all this way. Why don't we look around a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please don't ask me to do crazy shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, you win⋯ I'll take the dive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wheeeeeeeeee![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You know, if I take a dive from here, I'm sure to end up dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And then it's really GAME OVER.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't possibly do something THAT crazy.[%p]
