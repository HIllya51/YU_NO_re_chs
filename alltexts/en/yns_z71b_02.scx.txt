[name]Takuya[line]I hear something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's look for the source of the sound.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is that coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Footsteps⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is someone coming?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They stopped.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe they saw me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be someone dangerous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Don't move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Behind me?!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Oh, it's you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms⋯ Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I was going after Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After Ryuuzouji⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Do you remember what I told you at my hideout yesterday?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, for the most part.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Decades pass in the blink of an eye for that guy. I said it'd be best to cover up my tracks from the underground prison.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯but he still made his move.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. That means there was some reason he had to act. I know what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does he want?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's something sinister, that's for sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something sinister⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He's trying to create an event collision between Dela Grante and your world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! You can't be serious![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There's no doubt about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if he does that, then he'd be killing himself![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No, he won't die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right now, he's in the physical form of Ryuuzouji, but that's just a disguise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He's an ethereal being.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ethereal?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's right. He's a spirit-like presence that wanders between dimensions. No one even knows how he came to be that way⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Even if this world is destroyed, he'll keep on living in between dimensions. He's already destroyed three event trees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Event trees?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The worlds branching off of Vrinda's Tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]We have to hurry. By my calculations, it could happen as early as today. Tomorrow at the latest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Today or tomorrow⋯ What are you going to do, Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When the time comes, I'll be brought back to my original dimension automatically. I have a mechanism in my body that will keep me safe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]However, I don't know if there's a dimension transportation device in this world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A dimension transportation device?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]There are lots of things I still don't know about this world. I don't even know what level of technology they have here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's where he would be heading⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A dimension transportation device?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could she mean that place?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Don't lose hope. Not until the very end.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I want to save you, your friends, and your daughter. I want to save everyone. However, I am not allowed to interfere with other dimensions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Interference may cause harm to my own dimension. I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But please, don't lose hope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. If you lose hope, that'll be the end of it.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Right. Only those that never give up and believe until the very end can ever achieve their dreams.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'd like to meet you again some day. Goodbye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko has left⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said Ryuuzouji would be going to wherever the dimension transportation device is being held.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A dimension transportation device⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one place in Dela Grante where it could be hidden⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get back to the garden![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the Royal Guard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, wait. They're all split up and in a panic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It can't be the Royal Guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't heard another sound at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anyone there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't hear any voices from the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty dim down here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't even see the floor. I better be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lanterns lit here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the only light. I should use it to proceed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the noise⋯coming from outside, through the broken ceiling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it doesn't seem like that's the case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I have to find out what that sound is first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should take a look around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you want to know what that sound is?[%p]
