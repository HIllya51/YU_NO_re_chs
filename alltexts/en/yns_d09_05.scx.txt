[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko wants to ask me something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it be?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Now then⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, are you going somewhere?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You could say that. It's time for a walk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko? I know it's not my place to say anything considering my terrible attendance.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I know. It's half work and half play.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Half work?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A walk?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay, I'm going out now. If you're staying, keep an eye on the place for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You've got to be kidding.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It'll be locked at night, so no one will be able to get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. What a piece of work⋯ And she calls herself a teacher![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What happened with Mio?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing. Nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Some people think you're the anonymous reporter, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no fighting a rumor once it's started, is there? I hate it. Mio and I both.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I guess it's not you then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Which means you don't know anything about the information that was posted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a confusing statement.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ahem. What I'm asking is, how can you take on a position you know nothing about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it either. I can't say I don't know anything.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well that sounds suspicious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mio approached me. I'm no stranger to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why don't you tell me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It wouldn't do any good.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm, you're much more mature than you look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not nearly as mature as you, Granny.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't appreciate hurtful comments.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If only she were the kind of person to be hurt by that.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you say something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So, do you want to talk about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh well.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't fight this relentless pressure.)
[name]Eriko[line]I see. So that's how it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I keep my promises. If I promise not to tell anyone, I won't tell anyone.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that doesn't mean I can't write it down. And if someone happened to see it, well⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Understood. That's the kind of person you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You're the type that would keep a secret even if she committed a crime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just in my nature, huh?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Yes, that's who you are.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So who posted that on the bulletin board?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This would go much better for you if I knew that. It must be someone involved with the school.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Someone involved with the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I just saw her at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She was headed toward the coastline. She was in a hurry, so I didn't say anything to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Was she looking for the secrets of the Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio went to the coastline.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you see the bulletin board this afternoon?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]The look on your face would suggest you did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a baseless rumor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But we saw the results even before any proof came to light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The results?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I just heard it on the radio. Mio's father is going to resign as mayor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*puff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough cough*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]She's going to be so busy now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she doesn't like being stared at.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is that face she's making at me right now?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You sure seem to love people watching⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Ms. Eriko doesn't like being stared at too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A cigarette in her mouth, letting her hair cover her face. She doesn't look like a school physician to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But for some reason she doesn't look sloppy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her tits are big⋯it gets me excited.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have some big tits.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I better be the only one you do this with.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha. (Those are nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You know, you shouldn't stare at a woman's breasts so obviously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You say that, but I love how you're not even angry.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's because I know getting angry with you won't do any good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What was that sound just now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯probably the sound of my libido.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, I just noticed how short her skirt is. It's actually a bit⋯exciting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm starting to get excited.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, is it really okay for a teacher to wear such revealing clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes me happy, of course.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was your suggestion that there were endless benefits to wearing these kinds of clothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, you were correct in assuming that these clothes would get me through problems more smoothly when dealing with senior teachers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'm the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Why do you think I'm wearing the white coat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you weren't wearing these, you probably would have been mistaken for someone gnarly.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What do you mean, gnarly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll explain later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think Ms. Eriko isn't quite used to Japanese conventions.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's tied her hair back, but I can tell it's really long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is super long.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can barely see her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her physician's coat.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What if she were playing with herself through her pockets?)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You seem to be having some dirty thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has her hands in her pockets.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I bet there's a ton of cigarettes in them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is Ms. Eriko, the school doctor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I like Ms. Eriko, the school doctor, because she isn't like a typical teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Life hasn't really dragged her down yet, and she's a little unusual⋯in a fun way.)[%p]
