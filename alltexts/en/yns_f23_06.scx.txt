[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh⋯ Don't try to look so smooth, boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Actually, I want to talk to you. I've been looking for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with this guy?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I see⋯ So you don't really know either. There's no reason for you to pretend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]How about we negotiate?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Negotiate?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Yeah, make a deal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to deal with you.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Let me finish. I'm sure you want to know where your father is, eh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I want to know where Dr. Arima is, too. Both of our goals are aligned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It's simple. All you need to do is put this in Kanna Hatano's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It's a device that lets me listen to what she says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bug.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]That's a bad word for it. I prefer to think of it as polite eavesdropping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd never do something like that![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't you want to find your father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]From what I've seen, I believe that Kanna Hatano knows Dr. Arima's location.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna knows⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It seems she was with Dr. Arima for nearly a year. For all intents and purposes, she was Dr. Arima's lover.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Come on, don't look at me like that. I can't change the truth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. No matter how senseless the old bastard was⋯*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The bankbook in front of Kanna's apartment⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man's name⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The regular deposits⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be!)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It looks like you've got an idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how senseless my old man was, he would never have such an uptight college girl as a mistress.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What? You're not calling Kanna Hatano an innocent college girl, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I'm sure you know Kanna meets with all kinds of men.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Come now, even you had a nice time with Kanna Hatano last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Kanna is tight-lipped. It's hard to get information out of her.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I always see her at the hotel. She did at least show me a good time, so I can't complain⋯ Hmm?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What's wrong, boy? Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna⋯ Wasn't that just rumors and gossip?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And she was with my old man?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ah, my head's all mixed up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean⋯)
[name]Yuuki[line]((It seems Hatano is quite active with her male acquaintances.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((There is also the rumor that she has multiple boyfriends.))[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]((They say she'd do it with anyone.))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((Would you like to stay the night?))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((Only if you want to.))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((We didn't do anything last night.))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((Why not?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What's the matter, sonny? You got really quiet all of a sudden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, let me ask you one thing.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I can't tell you about my client, sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not it. Did you and Kanna⋯?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Yeah, a couple of times⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Ack![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you lie to me![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]S-Stop choking me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Whew⋯ Geez, you're acting like some yakuza punk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, answer me.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]L-Like I said⋯
a couple of times.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]L-Like I said⋯a couple of times.
[name]Takuya[line]So you're telling me she'll just sleep with anyone.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I don't know about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. Well, I'm still not planting your bug.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just ask her directly. I'll make her tell me the truth.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Can you do that? Actually, I bet you'd be able to. I know for a fact you're the first man that she's ever brought to her own place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I'm gonna do is prove that this is all untrue.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Well, your reasons don't matter. As long as you do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What I want to know is Dr. Arima's whereabouts. Nothing more, nothing less.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why should I tell you?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I thought you'd say that. When the time comes, I'll give you something you want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something I want?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]How about information about my client?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I bet you really want to know about who hired me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't that against the code of your profession?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I'm happy as long as I'm paid. And you don't look like the type to go blabbing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Right, why don't we meet one more time tonight? To exchange information.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, you're interested. Hmm, a secluded place would be best. How about Meiunji Park?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Two men in a park at night?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Even better. No one will suspect what we're really doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Okay, how about around twenty-two hundred hours?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Twenty-two hundred⋯ Oh, you mean 10pm.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Is that past your bed time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kiss my ass⋯ That's fine.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh, now you're talking⋯ In the meantime, I have to tell my client about this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About Kanna?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Yes, exactly. That Kanna Hatano is involved with Koudai Arima. I'll keep our promise, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're an awful person.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh well, I'm just leaking a tiny bit of information about my client to get my job done. I'm sure they'll still be satisfied with my work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sure.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Okay, it's decided. Heh heh, I'm counting on you, partner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Give me your phone number.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My number?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I can call you if something happens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I'm not gonna prank call you or anything. It'll be strictly business calls.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. But if a woman answers, hang up right away.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, is it your girlfriend?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's my mother.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Well?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My number is⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Okay, got it. So, I'll call you if something happens, yeah?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really want you to call.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh, until next time, then. Twenty-two hundred, Meiunji Park. Don't be late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just can't stand that guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's clear he's thinking about how to use me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, all I have to do is use him, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But for now, I want to talk to Kanna again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Dr. Koudai Arima might actually be alive somewhere⋯ Gaah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I-I can't breathe⋯my neck⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me what you know![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]S-Stop choking me⋯ Geez, kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're a scary one. I thought you were gonna kill me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you know where my old man is?![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh, the opposite: I'm asking because I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I hear he's a respected scholar, so having a college girl as a mistress would be quite the scandal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Now, now, don't play innocent. Isn't that why he disappeared?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hmph. Fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]If I learn Dr. Koudai Arima's whereabouts, I'll get a big payout.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His whereabouts? The newspaper said he died. The cops say the same thing.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Stop joking. Your reaction to that wasn't normal. That's proof that Dr. Arima is alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]At least my client thinks that's the case. No, it seems like they're sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your client? Who hired you?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Uh-uh, I can't say any more. Keeping secrets is the first rule of my profession.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]And I think Dr. Koudai Arima being alive would be more interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who the hell hired this guy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They know my old man is alive?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Here, take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this? It says you're a member of an inquiry agency.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]My job is to investigate things and notify my clients.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You mean you investigate affairs and stuff.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Well, that is what most of my clients want. That and background checks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Private detective is a vulgar term. I don't like it. I like the elegance of inquiry agent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what does an inquiry agent want with me?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I want your cooperation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cooperation?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Let me give you my card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your card?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I'm just a salaryman, despite my looks. Here. This ought to do for an introduction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're acting really different than last night.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Well, I have to be flexible to changing situations. Here, my card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need it.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't say that. I already know you. But you don't know me. That's not fair, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're saying you know me?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're Koudai Arima's son, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I knew it. I've been following you since last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're like a hyena. So you were following me?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Come on, don't glare at me like that. I'm not going to lie. I'm a little timid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Like I said, take my card.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who the hell is this guy?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're being stubborn. Stop it.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't get all fired up, boy.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Now, now⋯ You're always so quick to violence.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What? Do you wanna touch it that badly?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Do you wanna smell it too? It smells pretty good.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You shouldn't touch that.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I've got pomade all over my head.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You young people just don't understand. Everything about my life is tainted.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hrmph. This is my best outfit. What do you have to say about that?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I guess a youngster like you wouldn't wear this color. Hmph.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Wow. You've got eyes.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I bought this on sale a week ago.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hey! Quit picking your nose and look at me.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're pretty observant.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You can watch people without looking menacing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What are you trying to do? Get back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Why are you behaving so strangely?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
