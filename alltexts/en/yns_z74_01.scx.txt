[name]Takuya[line]It's the altar.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi isn't here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's really quiet around here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I'm right here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's useless to look at Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]It's not useless.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]You only call my name once in a while, and when you do, it's like, whatever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the altar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember there was a passage in the back there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No was sleeping naked over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why'd you hit me?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Because⋯ Ooh, it's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you blushing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what you're thinking.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]What? You're going back to the garden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯ Just got a feeling I should.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right⋯ I am sure it's beyond this altar.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There was something like a strange machine room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should check it out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel the muggy, hot air coming out again⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound of heavy machinery is echoing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I believe it's called the ritual chamber.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ritual⋯chamber?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes. As I heard from the God-Monarch, a number of the priestesses performed rituals here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A number of the priestesses performed rituals here⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then what is all this machinery?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Oh, it's fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]I was told that's the voice of the person preparing for the ritual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Preparing for⋯the ritual?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ritual performed by the priestess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is all this⋯?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Oxygen supply system, all green⋯))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Melgio⋯ Heavy nuclear fusion reaction, stand by.))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Grantia, 91,002 seconds until synchronization⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like much of a ritual to me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something much deeper than what I was expecting lies here in Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe this is⋯[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry it took a long time to convince the Royal Guard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Convince?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ To not cause any more harm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh this voice⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda⋯ You're alive?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh, well⋯ I was spared just minutes before death.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yes. That woman helped me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good⋯ I'm so glad you're safe.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]That woman⋯the God-Monarch, told me everything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told you⋯everything?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Yeah⋯ I can't believe it, but she helped me. She showed me evidence that I can't deny now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did she⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let me explain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I've already explained it to Amanda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This place is called the ritual chamber.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ritual chamber⋯ The place where the priestess performs the ritual.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what are all these machines?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This is the secret and the true form of Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I need to tell you everything. Will you listen to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the reason I came here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯ Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I need to talk to your father. Would you mind standing guard in the garden?[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Huh? But⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Oh, so you're Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Dad⋯who is this?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm going to be your mom, Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like hell![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I will take care of her. Although it's inside the castle, you never know what kind of danger might be lurking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look who's talking. I thought you were the leader of that dangerous gang.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Heh, heh⋯ Well, yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No, listen to me. I'll be fine.[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]Okay⋯ Let me know if anything happens.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Okay then, let me tell you about my relationship with your daddy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope she's not telling Yu-No weird things⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*chuckle* She is such a sweet lady.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Amanda is a nice woman, too. They really care about you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I don't want anybody to die.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯ I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What you are saying and what you are doing is not the same. The God-Monarch took the lives of so many priestesses.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How could⋯ I just don't understand how you can be here, acting like there's nothing wrong.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, I will tell you everything, all about what has been going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come to my room. Let's talk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That room is the true form of Dela Grante⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could it mean⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I listen to Ayumi's story, will all the mysteries be solved⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ It's not a bad room.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Here in the capital, there's no custom to sit around the table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, you just sit on the carpet?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I shall talk while we sit as they do in this land.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not a problem. As long as I get to hear your story.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Put your sword away in the corner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. I'll hold onto it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, you've grown strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I kinda had to be strong.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Your face looks much better than before⋯ You look sharp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it. I am what I am⋯ I haven't changed at all.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, you've changed. And I've changed too. People change.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is right in front of me.)[%p]
