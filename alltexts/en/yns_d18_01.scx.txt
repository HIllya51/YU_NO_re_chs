[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sounds of nature have returned to the coastline after so long.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no construction now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quieter than I thought. Even though there was that accident yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no construction now. It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater to block high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our town is on the right. I guess it's for high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants are growing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass down the stairs here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sand is shining in the sunlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction takes away the refreshing feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a date spot at night before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]So work's still on hiatus today.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, that's good for me.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's fine they're righting their wrongs.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But if Geo Technics goes under for this, who's gonna pay for my paycheck?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]By the way, did you hear?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]You know, the radio.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I guess Mayor Shimazu finally quit. They might also be investigating Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I heard that a truck blew up out of nowhere last night.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]There's no way that was from the lightning, right? Did you see the sky last night? It was full of stars.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* What are these insulated clothes going to help with?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Construction work is stopped for right now, but we don't know when another lightning strike will happen.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Do you know the voltage of lightning? These vinyl-coated work clothes will burn to a crisp.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, the construction's stopped for now, so it should be okay.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But the lightning strikes are all happening around the transportation.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm sure it's a coincidence, but don't you think it's weird?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That reminds me, I wonder what happened to those guys who went to the briefing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I heard Chief Arima really took a beating from all the people opposed to the construction.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I feel bad for her, but it's also kind of her own fault.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It happened again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Huh, what's her fault? The lightning, of course.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This is what happens when they force us to continue construction all of the sudden.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Chief Arima is a horrible woman. She has no regard for our lives at all.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm quitting today or tomorrow, so I don't care.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But there's always an accident when we try to transport the dirt out of here.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What kind of construction are they doing here?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I mean, it's weird. We dig and dig. We gather up dirt, and just transport it somewhere.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, they say it's a geological survey, so I guess collecting the dirt is part of it.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* But it's weird.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I already got paid, so I don't care what happens now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The guy over there is only thinking about his paycheck.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I quit Geo Technics today.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just them telling me I don't have to come back tomorrow makes me pretty happy.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's sunny today⋯but there might still be lightning.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It has nothing to do with the weather. Lightning could strike at any time.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But that company is so strange.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They say it's a geological survey, but why are they moving out dirt?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Back to work after what's just happened yesterday? No way.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]We don't know when lightning will strike again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's strange though. Why does lightning always strike during the transportation?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Religious folk say it's the wrath of the gods.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I also wanted to go to the briefing and throw an egg at that Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The construction's on hold for now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But we don't know when lightning could strike again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm seriously thinking about finding a new job.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I guess there was a little commotion at the briefing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Apparently some overzealous protestors threw eggs at that Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The family of those that died seemed pretty frustrated.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]With all the accidents, the other workers are getting antsy. What can you do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, there's a truck there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that the truck that caught on fire last night?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck must be for moving earth and sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if they just leave it out here, it'll be bad for the engine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That ocean breeze always blows at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what are they transporting? This is a geological survey, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's for transporting dirt and sand or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This ocean is so beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope the construction finishes soon so I can swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still hot and perfect for the beach, but no one's swimming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because of the construction, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi's in charge of it, so I can't really say much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can faintly hear the whispering of the waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is dark and quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the proper name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost nobody around here calls it that, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the sights of Sakaimachi. It's known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. It's night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright and blue, but it looks gloomy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction is on hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like they stopped construction for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's because of what happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How was there lighting on a sunny day like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seeing it from here, it looks like nothing happened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there was an accident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what a geological survey looks like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like they could do it on a smaller scale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the construction site's fence. Apparently they're doing a geological survey inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what I saw from the rooftop, it looked like they're digging up the beach for all its worth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a pretty nice place before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't hear the construction now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the construction is on hold for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All that rumbling from the construction is loud. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet all around. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I wonder how that briefing went.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was Ayumi all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I kind of wonder about Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school, huh? Mitsuki said she had a half night shift.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I bet Mio went to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then everything would make sense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know she's there. Okay, let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'm meeting Mio at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think she's there yet, but I should just go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing will be at the shrine at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make sure that Toyotomi guy doesn't see me.[%p]
