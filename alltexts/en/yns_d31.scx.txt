[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya, where were you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, I was just looking in the garden.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Find anything unusual?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No. What about the tapestry?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can't find his mother anywhere. That means we only have a short time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That should be enough. It's not like I'm assessing it for its sale value.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Right. Come over here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is quite a large mansion though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, it was built 400 years ago and has a lot of history to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This mansion?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]After repeated expansions, not much of the original house is left though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That storehouse seems pretty old.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, that's the strange part. It was just built recently, but it's suddenly all dilapidated.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, by just built recently, you mean?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]About six months ago. Do you think something like that is possible?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not⋯impossible. A movie crew could easily make a new building look old.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Well, you have a point there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So that storehouse was just recently built⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What kind of maintenance work would you have to botch up to make it look like that?)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* Sorry. This is boring. Now, about the tapestry⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's in Ryuuzouji's living room, so come on in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now I can finally see that tapestry Mio was talking about.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the same tapestry my old man apparently saw.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what it's like.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the living room?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes, this is the living room of Ryuuzouji's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, it looks⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Looks like he just moved in, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It would have been perfect with a bunch of cardboard boxes around.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]This isn't the time for jokes. It's been like this for over a month now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Everything he didn't need for his research was thrown out, including most of his furniture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A month ago⋯ So that's around the same time that storehouse started falling apart.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Actually, you're right. I didn't notice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you think something happened to Ryuuzouji a month ago?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Like something to do with his mental state?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good guess. Maybe he had some deep thinking to do, needed a breath of fresh air or something, and tried moving to a new place.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Actually, it was around that time that he changed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what I thought. Something about his mental state must have changed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, seeing a room so tidy feels good though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]To be honest, this room is completely empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you think this whole big mansion is like this?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. Ryuuzouji's living space is usually like this. Ryuuzouji sleeps here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, right here?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He says he likes the hard floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sorry, that has nothing to do with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]The tapestry is on the wall behind me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The front of that?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah. It's okay to go closer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the tapestry.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the storehouse entrance. This place sure is creepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a storehouse straight out of a movie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯unkempt. It's a complete mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
