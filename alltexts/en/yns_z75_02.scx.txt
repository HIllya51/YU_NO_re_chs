[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hey, stay right there. Haha. I'm stronger than I seem, so if I get tense I might break her little arm.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Augh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Then do not move⋯ Hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ What do I do? What should I do?!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Back when I was drifting across the dimensions⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I was drifting between dimensions for a long time⋯for tens of thousands of years, and couldn't even recall my own name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tens of thousands of⋯years?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That long⋯?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I am not sure when and where I was born⋯but I knew that I was alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Something came close to me.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It was the spirit of a scientist who was trying to research history by going back to the beginning of all events.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this what Ms. Eriko was talking about?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, just like a line of clouds passing while you are looking up at the sky, the trace of that man's consciousness lingered on.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]While passing through the event element waves, I followed that trace and entered the body of a man.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Of course, the man's consciousness could not return to his body⋯ He was virtually dead.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Once I enter a physical body, I inherit all memories of that person. However, it is quite difficult to deceive people.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Especially someone like a lover.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I came to your world using that person's ride, but it has broken down⋯ Hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Just when I was looking for an energy source, I noticed the Hypersense Stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see⋯now I know.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you, anyway?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I am Ryuuzouji.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Quit it, I know you are the dimensional criminal Ms. Eriko is going after.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmm, that's what she told you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying you're not?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hah hah⋯ It seems she is a Dimension Inspection Agent. However, she is chasing me for other reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Her personal grudge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grudge?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((T-minus 11,005 seconds until entering the limit radius⋯))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Let me tell you. It seems like we have a few more hours. Heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is pursuing Ryuuzouji for her personal grudge?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ Just wait there.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What⋯ What's next?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you going to do with Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Nothing. I'll leave her alone for now⋯ After all, we just have to wait a few hours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]If an event collision occurs, I can escape from that fussy woman⋯ Hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you do this, the two worlds will⋯ Two dimensions will disappear.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh, you seem to have gained some knowledge from her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're going to die, too.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I won't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Even though this world will perish, my consciousness shall remain⋯ I can just wait for a different event to pass between dimensions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, what a guy⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, I only have to wait for time to pass. Because there is an infinite amount of time⋯ Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I do with a guy like this?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Soon, Dela Grante will start to move. The collision avoidance program will start activating.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dela Grante will⋯move?![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Grantia's consciousness is about to come back to Dela Grante.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grantia's consciousness⋯ In order to move Dela Grante?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Correct.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A pity for the Ryuuzouji who envisaged the event collision.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see⋯ You heard about it from Aichlikkwadrou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's talking about Ms. Eriko⋯ I knew it.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh Heh⋯ You cannot talk to Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is not in a condition to talk now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it, unless I separate Ayumi from Ryuuzouji⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, Yu-No is⋯ Ugh![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Be quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it, Ryuuzouji![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh⋯ I don't like a woman who talks too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Please enter the key⋯))[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]The priestess, the key to all of this, is not here yet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy⋯ How much stuff does he know?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Check.))[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((T-minus 10,302 seconds until entering the Schwarzschild phenomenal radius⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Schwarzschild phenomenal radius⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It is the boundary radius of an event which absolutely cannot be avoided⋯ I call it fate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fate⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]In other words, it is fated that an event collision occurs in a few hours⋯ Hah hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ I won't let him do that!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Please enter the key. Please enter the key⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Soon, Dela Grante will start to move.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And Grantia's consciousness will be coming back here⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It started to activate⋯but the key person is not here yet.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Lucky you⋯ Hah hah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Key person?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does he mean⋯ Yu-No?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The heavy operating sound is beginning to echo louder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the device starting to work?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Heh heh. Grantia's consciousness is about to return to Dela Grante once again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grantia's consciousness will be here once again⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The consciousness that moves Dela Grante is about to return?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He is using Ayumi as a shield.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Pisses me off, but it's working⋯ Damn it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should slowly approach him little by little, and⋯)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hey, stay right there. I do not want to stab Ayumi with this dagger.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ He caught me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's holding Ayumi down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it, what if I throw the sword from here and⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then again, it might hit Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't move carelessly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Otherwise, Ayumi will be⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji has her restrained.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi looks like she's in pain.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No⋯ I can't go outside now!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't be a fool⋯ I can't go outside now!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Stop it⋯ I suggest you give up on that foolish idea of yours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ Nothing I can do now!)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hey, stay right there.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I feel bad for Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The nerve!)[%p]
