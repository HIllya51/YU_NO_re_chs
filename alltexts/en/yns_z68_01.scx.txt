[name]Takuya[line]This is where Celes used to live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But for the Imperial Capital, this place looks run down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch might be here. Let's go to the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, Amanda hasn't returned yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda is taking a long time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How far did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is the place where Celes used to live⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see any people around at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm the only person here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I hear is the rustling of the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Such a quiet place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought it'd be a much more lively, thriving city.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd never guess it'd look like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, it probably wasn't always so abandoned.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this⋯the Imperial Capital?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lot of the place is in ruin.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how many people live here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are buildings lining the streets, so someone must have lived here at some point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it was a thriving city in the past.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, this is the Imperial Capital.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cracks in the building⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stones seem eroded too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt these buildings are full of people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are vines winding around the buildings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One of the characteristics of Dela Grante⋯ Man-made buildings and nature intertwining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's an entrance into the sewers among the bushes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might be important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some kind of⋯lid in the bushes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to really tell, but the top looks like a maintenance hatch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hatch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an entrance to the sewers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that's pretty obvious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, a big city like this would have advanced technology. It should come as no surprise that they have a sewer system.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that means the city has running water, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems to me this is some well thought out city planning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Vegetation everywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They might just have a culture that's very protective of nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if the God-Monarch lives there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at that building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could call it a castle, I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Far away, built up tall so the God-Monarch can look down on everyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we go there, will we get to see the God-Monarch?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a pretty big building. Who lives there, I wonder?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The distance from here must be⋯300 feet away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe 600?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it's a building, that means someone could be living there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who would live in such a huge building?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or maybe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could that big building be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a rather large building in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you can see it right in front there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't any buildings to move over to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next one is that building far away you can see in front.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not like we could reach it from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How did I just make that sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Left this time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I faintly sense the presence of another person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange. There's no one around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll check the building on the right this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't just barge in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to investigate this area a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I look around here a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have time to be standing around here, doing nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was planning on parting ways with Amanda here, anyway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need her help and guidance to get through this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay then⋯wait, what's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's running this way.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda? Why does she look so panicked?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya, RUN!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on, Amanda?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]*huff* Takuya, we need to run![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Run?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]They're coming![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]The Royal Guard! They found my hideout![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]All of my comrades⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]We'll never make it in time![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The Royal Guard⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit. There's only two of us.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be helped. I doubt things will end peacefully.)[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Wha⋯ No, Takuya! Leave your sword![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Be quiet. They'll hear you.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯you're going to fight them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going to distract them. You need to run while I'm at it.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]You can't be serious! You're completely outnumbered![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll buy you some time. I do know how to use a sword, by the way. I may not look like it, but I've practiced kendo.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]I'm going to fight too, then![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be ridiculous. You don't even have a weapon. You'll just get in the way.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get going.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]N-No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, now isn't the time to be acting like a spoiled brat.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But⋯ I have to fight![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be fine. I'm going to run away when I find my chance. They say running is always the best plan, right?[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hurry up and get out of here.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be fine. I'll make a huge scene and get captured.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]What⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then you can come later and break me out.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right now, we'll both end up getting caught.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just do what I say! That's the only chance we have![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]O-Okay, I got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I've got this. Get outta here.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Amanda[line]Don't die.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, I'm not planning on dying anytime soon.[%p]
[name]Amanda[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh, she sure can be cute sometimes.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You, stop right there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want to pass, you'll have to go through me.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The God-Monarch's cronies are here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I haven't forgotten about Celes' death.)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]So, you're the last standing revolutionist?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm no revolutionist.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Regardless, you aren't behaving as an obedient subject.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not. I don't remember subjecting myself to anyone's rule. Can't say I've ever been called a subject before, for that matter.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Heh. Yet you still go against the ways of the God-Monarch, do you not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no interest in the policies or actions of the God-Monarch. I just want to slam my fist into his face.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Watch your mouth, you dirty rebel![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm no rebel, asshole.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]I heard that the rebel leader, Amanda, was sent to the 8th mine after being arrested.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, and the mine's been completely destroyed.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Destroyed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was reduced to rubble by that earthquake.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]And you two are the only ones who got out alive?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like it.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]So, the apocalypse is closer than expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some say there won't be an apocalypse. They say it's just the God-Monarch's lie to keep the people in check.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Whatever. I'm not here to argue with you, or talk for that matter. The only thing I have to say is this: surrender now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I don't?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Don't cause trouble. Toss your sword to the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I see how it is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll slice through this guy first, then jump into the circle of guards.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](After I cause some havoc, I'll lay down my sword and surrender.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They won't kill me just yet. They want to know what I know about Amanda and where she is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Okay⋯ Everything should be all right!)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Halt![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh great⋯ Who's that?)[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Priestess![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The⋯priestess?[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]Priestess, what are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Fools. This man is going to cut right through you.[%p]
[name]Royal Guard[line]My apologies, priestess.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]What is your name?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Can you not speak?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Tell me your name, now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit⋯my surprise attack plan completely failed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, whatever. There are other ways.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But this woman in front of me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have anyone to talk to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'm sure there's someone around somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it doesn't seem like there's anyone around here I can talk to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she went to get in touch with the other members of the resistance?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just stand around doing nothing, even if she told me to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Amanda went out for a bit and told me to wait here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I know that she's alive, somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what you are doing now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she's waiting for me, somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things that happened just a few months ago feel like they happened years in the past.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's nowhere to be found⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way the God-Monarch would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only place I could think the God-Monarch would be is the castle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way the most important person in the city would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I had to guess where the God-Monarch would be, it'd be a castle of some sort.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A castle⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
