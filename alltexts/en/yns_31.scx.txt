[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the storehouse entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is Ms. Eriko looking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something⋯ Something moved![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?! Where did that come from?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a damaged storehouse here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Okay, let's go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, your clothes are messed up.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're blushing too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'll fix myself right up, so just look the other way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! Okay, I'll be in the courtyard.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yeah, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh man⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to believe this storehouse was only built six months ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Judging by the condition it's in, I figured it'd be as old as the mansion.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya, we're in trouble![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that face for? What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]We have a big problem![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I didn't take your panties, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Shut up. I heard a car outside just now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A car?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji just came home. This isn't good![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He did? If we bump into him, we'll be in deep shit.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]He always goes inside from the garage in the back. He should be in the courtyard right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, things are getting so rushed all of a sudden.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ma'am?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ohohoho⋯ He's coming home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's he?[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Go on now. Hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thank you so much, ma'am. Let's go Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Old Woman[line]Ohohoho⋯ Did the young man come in handy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Mitsuki, are you here?![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's him! Takuya, let's go![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Coming![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That was a pretty serious kiss. Nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Still though⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does that old lady know something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, it would be a good idea to leave the mansion.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ryuuzouji went into the main house. We need to hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right behind you.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Come on, this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! Things are getting chaotic.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm sorry I can't help you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I should be the one apologizing.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Where are you, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wah! Come on! I said hurry up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Coming![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]In the well, there's a⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Go! Hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That was a pretty serious kiss. Nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Still though⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What did Mitsuki want to say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, it would be a good idea to leave the mansion.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the storehouse entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mitsuki is still at Ryuuzouji's place.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't scare me like that! I nearly had a heart attack![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you did, I'd be happy to give you mouth to mouth.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Shut up! Anyway, what about the storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about it?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm pretty sure it's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really? It was open.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can tell just how disheveled it is in the daylight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's bad enough seeing how much space it covers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a storehouse straight out of a movie.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯unkempt. It's a complete mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
