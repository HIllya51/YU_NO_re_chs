[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯ What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is that coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is that sound coming from the fluorescent lamp?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not radio waves. I don't hear it coming from the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a sound the air conditioner would make either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The first aid kit is not ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the table but the medicine box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means the sound isn't coming from around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think trash cans vibrate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a kitchen knife and pot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kitchen knives and pots don't make noises all on their own.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Empty cans⋯not a drop inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some empty cans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Empty cans don't produce their own sounds either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be where she cooks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a simple kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge looks empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the fridge can vibrate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like alcohol. Must be the empty liquor bottles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just one cup on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter where I look, the best word to describe this place is 「simple.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that old bastard's bankbook was in here.[%p]
*ka-chink*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cupboard for storage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be stored in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's for storing things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing under the bed⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna's bra and underwear⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's plain white. Why is it so simple?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to be looking at that kind of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's on the bed⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cell phone![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should check it out.[%p]
[name]Voice[line](You finally picked up the phone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That voice belongs to⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line](Don't hang up. And I don't want to hear any whining.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line](Didn't you tell me this thing was important to you?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line](If you want this necklace back, tell me where Koudai Arima is.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line](And don't bother trusting that boy, either.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line](He and I are working together. You're all alone, Kanna, so just give up the info already.)[%p]
[name]Voice[line](Come to Meiunji Park. Tell me where Koudai Arima is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That voice sounds really familiar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure it's that guy, Houjou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want your necklace back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got a bad feeling about this. No, not a bad feeling: it's closer to a conviction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If the old bastard shows up, I won't let him off easy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm sure that's where Kanna went. I should hurry![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the bathroom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the sound's coming from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, not there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the sound is coming from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just let it keep ringing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I shouldn't just go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why was the door unlocked? That's a little strange.[%p]
