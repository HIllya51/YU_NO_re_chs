[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the middle of a mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's called the Tower of Garzel, apparently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to strike anyone trying to escape with a lightning bolt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond us, there's a tower⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That fat warden called this the Tower of Garzel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said it's a wonderful tower that takes care of any fool who tries to escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I've seen this tower before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh boy, I shouldn't be standing around and chatting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got to work or they'll kill me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A one of a kind item that's meant only for the priestess⋯ Which they make from the stones mined here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes might have used that if things went differently⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of earthquakes happening recently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope nothing gets out of hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh, heh. No dilly dallying now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit, that fat ass warden is here.)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I've been watching you. You've been resting for more than your allotted time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This slimy scumbag⋯ He was watching the clock this whole time.)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Now I have to punish you. Heh, heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Then get it over with!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All this idiot can do is snap a whip anyways.)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, those eyes of yours. Those eyes of yours are a lot of trouble.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]They're making me so happy. Those rebellious eyes⋯ Heh, heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, still standing?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]How valiant. But can you stand after this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gaah![%p]
*slam*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Yes, get on your knees and apologize.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*spit*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Those eyes again? Heh, heh, heh. How happy it makes me to see them![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahhhhh!!![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh, heh. That's fine.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]On your knees, completely powerless⋯ That's how a prisoner should behave![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, still have enough energy to raise your head, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*spit*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Grah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Spitting in my face now, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I'd give that ugly face of yours a little cleaning up.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Very funny. Unfortunately, you'll regret that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Agh![%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh! How's this?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gaahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Agh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Guh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]*gasp* *pant pant*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You won't learn your lesson until I really give it my all, eh? Heh, heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]*pant* Ugh, geez.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Somebody lock this guy up in a cell.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Don't bother being careful with him. Just make sure he doesn't die from his wounds.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]He's the most efficient worker we have.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]The God-Monarch told us to get this done as fast as possible⋯ So he's very valuable labor.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Still⋯don't give him any more treatment than he needs to live. That'll be his punishment.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I'll see you back at work tomorrow. Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]If you cause trouble again, I'll put you in solitary confinement.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Heh, heh. I've got to admit that's a brilliant idea.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I wonder how you'd fare trapped in a cell that's both burning hot and frigid cold⋯ Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not going to give up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No matter what that fat ass does to me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I promised Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I promised I'd come save her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I made a promise to Celes when she died, too.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That I'd survive anything⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯and that I'd punch that bastard God-Monarch who killed her, square in the face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Until then, I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯will never⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I⋯will⋯never⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I⋯will⋯)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, wake up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that, a giant mosquito?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'm not a mosquito.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then some kind of bathroom bug?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cockroach?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Unfortunately, no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then who are you?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Shhh. You're being too loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ I'm in a cell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the prisoners sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I here⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that fat warden whipped me unconscious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I was brought here, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night. How long was I sleeping?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Only a few hours.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahh![%p]
[name]Worker[line]Shhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're one of those prisoners. What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Excuse me? I-I've been tending to you this whole time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've⋯what?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Shhh⋯ Don't let the warden find out. He told us not to take care of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Your entire body is covered in welts. It's really bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I should thank you⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It was nothing. I've never seen the warden turn so red before⋯ He was furious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Was he that mad? Nice.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]However⋯you'll die if you keep pulling stunts like that, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything's gonna be okay. I'm invincible.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hahaha⋯ For some reason when you say it, I actually believe it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, right?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]All the workers here are on your side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really⋯ I'm glad to hear it.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just don't do anything too brash. If you die, everyone's morale will go way down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, I guess my life isn't completely my own now, huh?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]You are proof that people with hope still exist, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hope, huh? I'll⋯try to be more careful.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]How are you feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm feeling better than ever. Want me to do a headstand?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hahaha⋯ Maybe you really are invincible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should go to sleep. Staying awake this late will only make tomorrow harder.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yes, I will, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, still got something to say?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I was just wondering why we continue on like this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Rumors say the priestess isn't even with us. That the priestess who's supposed to perform the ritual is⋯dead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]A lot of people think we're done for because of that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just today there were several earthquakes. Everyone's freaking out about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Everyone thinks the big one is going to come some day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]You remember, don't you? The worker that died from that lightning bolt⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That guy knew he'd die. He wasn't thinking about escaping, not even for a moment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯he was committing suicide.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I understand how he feels. If the priestess isn't alive, it doesn't matter what we do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I disagree.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]R-really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think life is over for those that think it's over.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That's⋯very philosophical. And tough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I can't believe how selfish that priestess was to abandon us and escape all by herself![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey!!![%p]
[name]Worker[line]Wh-What are you doing?! I can't⋯breathe⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know a thing! Don't⋯ Don't talk shit about what you don't know.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Y-you got it! Just let me go, please⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What's gotten into you, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Nothing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just don't judge people on hearsay.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I will⋯heed your warning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides, we shouldn't live our lives for the God-Monarch or the priestess. We should live on our own accord.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If people are gonna die just because the priestess is gone, it doesn't change a thing. They would've died no matter what.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You should sleep. Tomorrow will be tough.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Y-You're right⋯goodnight, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks for taking care of me.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Of course. You are everyone's hope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm their hope⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a little beyond me. I'm only living for myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right. There isn't anyone as selfish as me here.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh, that's right![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaah![%p]
[name]Worker[line]Shhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it now?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, it's just⋯it's another rumor. Forgive me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just spit it out already.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Have you heard the rumor that a very important person was captured and brought here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A very important person?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Never heard that before, who is it supposed to be?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm not sure. I was eavesdropping on the warden while he talked to his underlings⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It seems as though the tyranny of the God-Monarch will continue on forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An important person was captured⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And⋯the God-Monarch's tyranny will only continue⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, whatever. Time to sleep. Gotta get up early tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Goodnight⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just what are we all working for⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯now that the priestess is gone?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is mining for stones⋯pointless?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a minute.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there something I'm forgetting?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Near the tower⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These workers have no idea why they're digging.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's the point to all this mining?)
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that I think about it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I remember.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow ow ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though I slept so well⋯ Everything hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, no! The sun's already up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got to get to work, or the warden's going to punish me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've already been whipped two days in a row. I really don't wanna make it three.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Time to get to work![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just barely made it. I think it's going to be fine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Still⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I was having an important dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some kind of connection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For now, I've got to get working. Guess I should check in with the warden⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are all those people gathering together?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got no idea what they plan to do with the sacred stones we dig up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even the workers don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The warden won't tell me anything, but I've heard rumors.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They make a casket from the stones for the priestess to use during ceremonies.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it seems like they only prepare one for the priestess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say there are as many chances as there are stars. Like do-overs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the other side of the desert, there's a mountain full of abandoned caskets.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many rumors about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mountain of abandoned caskets⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that's what I saw in my dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mining camp and a prison.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I learned something important by asking around. This is a camp for political prisoners.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People who oppose the God-Monarch, like protestors and rebels, are imprisoned here and forced to work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyone who questions the way of the God-Monarch or opposes the Imperial Capital's administration ends up out here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little reassuring to know we're all like-minded people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The most important thing I've learned here is that you can't stop moving. The moment you do, the warden's whip will find you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha! He's never whipped me before. Looks like he cut his lip doing it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That'll teach him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is a mining site for sacred stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mining site for sacred stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It takes a long time, several days in fact. But eventually, you'll find stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they would be nice stones on their own, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone said the stones are for the priestess's ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, the priestess is already⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How many times have I seen this view?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long have I been working here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be about a year since I started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But they haven't broken me yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so satisfying to see the warden's disappointment when he looks at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I glare back at him every time he does to remind him I'm still here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just dig and carry soil.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be working now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone is working silently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My eyes might look glazed over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I am not gone. I won't give up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not until I see Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like they're digging underground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They break apart the bedrock with pickaxes and shovel away the dirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They separate the dirt from the pale stones in some sort of refinery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I shouldn't move toward the tower right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The warden told me something a while ago that made me think I'm better off staying away from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does the tower's lightning strike anyone who tries to escape?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How does it work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be a way to escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just have to keep my head down and look for an opportunity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Have to be careful or I'll end up like the others⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Roasted alive by lightning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's take a break for a while.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we don't take a break, our bodies won't be able to keep this up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's just take a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If we overdo it, we'll destroy our bodies. Good health is important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's rest.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't work if I don't move this dirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I can keep going as long as I don't stop and think about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm only going to do this one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've just got to break this rock down into dust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grruhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there yet![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is tough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One more![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff huff huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great. It's got to look something like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Next⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The pile of dirt is in the way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to carry all of this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, one more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold the pick at 45-degree angle and twist it in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grruhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is good exercise. Whew![%p]
[name]Worker[line]You are incredible, as always.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]How do you keep up your strength and energy?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Even that horrible warden is impressed.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The thought of working here the rest of my life makes me want to die.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But you keep me encouraged.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I really respect how hard you work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha! You respect me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not what you think. I made a promise to Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I refuse to break my promise to her. That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, another earthquake. They've been happening a lot more often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it leading up to a big one?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, there's no point worrying about it right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We've got work to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We've got to get all this dirt out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Otherwise, we won't be able to continue mining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's get started. First, break the bedrock with a pick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grruhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not there yet![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This bedrock is so hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn! The moment I hit it, my arms went numb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's take care of what I've already dug up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The dust around here is from prior work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the stones that are embedded in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sacred stones⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the warden said they use them for the ceremony.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Better not think about that right now. It's time to move on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, what's next?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would you like to take a break?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's take a moment to rest and look around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's carry it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof![%p]
Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa! I lost my balance![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. Now I'll have to start all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've got to pick this dirt up off the ground and get it out of here.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'll help you pick it up.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Don't worry. I like doing this.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's amazing how much you can move all at once.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hey. Take a look around.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's normal for diggers and carriers to divide the labor. You're the only one I've seen do both.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Is that more efficient?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I see. Everyone says you're amazing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's the first time I've met anyone strong enough to take on the warden.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I may not be able to face the warden, but there are a lot of people rooting for you.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Okay, I've finished cleaning everything up. Now we won't have to start over from scratch.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]By the way⋯ The earthquakes have gotten more frequent.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm worried there's going to be some kind of catastrophe soon.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I hope whatever we're doing will help prevent a disaster.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, I'll do my best. I support you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You support me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somehow, I feel embarrassed by that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I only work this hard because I made a promise to Yu-No.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I didn't have a good reason for doing this, I'd lose my drive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I don't want to give the warden the satisfaction of breaking me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've just got to keep up my energy. That's all there is to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I am a little tired though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Every day's work is just as hard as the next.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to rest a little bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no more dirt to carry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We've got to dig into the ground before we can move the dirt out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, one more⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They want us to carry it all to a specific spot. Let's get moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Grruhh!!!![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]

[name]Takuya[line]Whew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, that's the end of the second round.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I tell myself I'm exercising, it makes it more bearable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've just got to think of it like he's letting me exercise and build my strength every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One day, I'll teach him a lesson.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no more dirt to carry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to dig again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They want us to carry it all to a specific place.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Whew![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, that's the end of the first round.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was pretty tough at first. But it's all in how you choose to look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gotta dig first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gotta dig first, or there won't be anything to carry.[%p]
