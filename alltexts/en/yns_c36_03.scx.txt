[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, it was you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now comes the crucial moment⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to be patient.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I hate this guy with every fiber of my being, but I need to be careful here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Punching him right now wouldn't be a good idea⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Come on. Hurry up and give me the rest of the documents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I had them, what would you do about it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I thought I made it clear: I don't need to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ch-Chief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya. Why are you here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]He's trespassing. I was just reprimanding him for it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]This is bad, Chief. You can't let him into restricted areas.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I-I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, is it true you've been dismissed as head facilitator?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And now this guy is taking over your–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ahem! I have some urgent business, so I'll be going.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((Hmph. Don't look so pleased with yourself.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What's that supposed to mean?))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((She trusts me more than anyone else.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((A woman likes a knight in shining armor more than an unreliable man.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Who are you calling unreliable?))[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]((You wouldn't call a man who gets his ass handed to him by some punks very reliable.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What did you say?!))[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you two talking about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I must be going, Chief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. That scene keeps flashing before my eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I tell her?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't come in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, but⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯ What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You seem smart, but I wouldn't call you clever. Think about it logically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What would happen if you got caught here? Things would be even worse for Chief Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]She'd be lucky to only get fired. What do you plan to do if she's presented with criminal charges?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right⋯ Ayumi had to take responsibility, but she only lost her position as head facilitator.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I make it worse for her, it wouldn't only be a demotion. She'd be lucky to get away with only being fired.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. There's nothing I can do.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now, give it back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here you go, 10 yen.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯I meant the documents you have in your hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They belong to Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't mistake me. Those are company property. They don't belong to her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Not to mention that she's no longer in charge of those papers. It's obvious which one of us is in the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All this tedious logic.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you plan to do with these?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't need to tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're thinking, but I do know that you used yakuza to attack Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's just an accusation. I have the right and obligation to take those documents. Now hand it over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If you give them to me now, I won't report you this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I don't?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Don't be stupid. If you won't cooperate, then unfortunately, I'll have to call security.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might just tell them the truth.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]And what is the truth?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That you had those yakuza attack Ayumi, and that you caused an accident by forcing construction to continue.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, got any proof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'd appreciate it if you didn't underestimate me. There is no way you can outwit me. Shall I call security now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn. Was I wrong?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do? Do I just give Toyotomi the documents?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Of course you don't have a convincing explanation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes I do.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, so you have a convincing reason why you, an intruder, broke in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My stepmother is the head facilitator. It's normal for a son to visit his parent, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Your information is outdated. She's already been relieved of her executive duties. I'm the acting head facilitator now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]With all those scandals, the lightning strikes, the break-in, losing documents and so on, it couldn't be helped, could it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But that was you–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, that's enough with your unfounded slander.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it⋯ There's nothing I can say here.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's really expensive, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy's really proud of himself.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about your stiff burlap?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen, it's a $1,200 suit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The burlap suit⋯ I mentioned it before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just call it stiff from now on.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Stop saying nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe that I got caught by Toyotomi, of all people.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?)[%p]
