[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There doesn't seem to be anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see Ayumi now.[%p]
Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mio isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should meet back up with Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like construction is already finished.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Finished is not the right word. It just turned to night while the construction was interrupted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the construction is still on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the construction's on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the construction is still on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. Geo Technics is on top of the hill in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Ayumi trusts that Toyotomi guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I just can't trust him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to talk to him just once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like that jerk isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Would the construction workers tell me something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it looks like that jerk isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He always comes out yelling at me, so he must've gone somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I don't find Ayumi fast, something bad might happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nobody at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will Ayumi be there if I go to Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no drug store here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beach is quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's hard to believe there was a lightning strike in the afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was just another lightning strike here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you worried about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think she's probably at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Ayumi is at the school, meeting with the headmaster.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline. Looks like they're doing construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to talk to her as soon as possible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater to block high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our town is on the right. I guess it's for high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants are growing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass down the stairs here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sand is shining in the sunlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction takes away the refreshing feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a date spot at night before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]And I wonder what kind of construction it is.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I still don't know.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Which reminds me, I just heard that rumor.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They're going to make that chief take all the responsibility at the board meeting.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, she did all that, so it can't be helped.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Wh-What's with that look? Geez, don't get so angry.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But that company is so strange.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They say it's a geological survey, but why are they moving out dirt?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]So work's still on hiatus today.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, that's good for me.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That reminds me, Chief Arima looked pretty concerned on her way to the company building.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Did something happen?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I think she went to the company building.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* What are these insulated clothes going to help with?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Construction work is stopped for right now, but we don't know when another lightning strike will happen.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Do you know the voltage of lightning? These vinyl-coated work clothes will burn to a crisp.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Talking to Toyotomi won't get you anywhere.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]He was looking pretty serious about something.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]He was mumbling to himself. Something about not having enough.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What was that about?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What happened with the briefing?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wish we could get a satisfying answer from the company.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I guess everyone went to the company building to negotiate directly.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm quitting today or tomorrow, so I don't care.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It happened again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This is what happens when they force us to continue construction all of the sudden.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Chief Arima is a horrible person. She has no regard for our lives at all.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* Well, let's get to it.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]He said we were transporting something.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]There's always an accident when we transport things. Will it be okay?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I shoulda' taken another job. I hear this construction is cursed.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This job has gotten pretty bad.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just today they're supposed to have a briefing for the local residents.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But that's just a drop in the bucket.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But there's always an accident when we try to transport the dirt out of here.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What kind of construction are they doing here?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I mean, it's weird. We dig and dig. We gather up dirt, and just transport it to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, they say it's a geological survey, so I guess collecting the dirt is part of it.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* But it's weird.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's sunny today, so I hope there's no lightning.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh yes, I heard there will be a board meeting soon.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I hear they're gonna make someone pay for everything that's been going on.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder who will take the fall.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder when work will start again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's sunny today⋯but there might still be lightning.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It has nothing to do with the weather. Lightning could strike at any time.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* I wonder if these insulated clothes will even help.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Don't tell Toyotomi that I was complaining.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But he didn't look very happy today.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Toyotomi? I think he might be at the company building.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Back to work after what's just happened yesterday? No way.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]We don't know when lightning will strike again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's strange though. Why does lightning always strike during the transportation?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Religious folk say it's the wrath of the gods.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh yes, I heard there will be a board meeting soon.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I hear they're gonna make someone pay for everything that's been going on.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder who will take the fall.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Uh-oh, Toyotomi will flip if he hears I said that. Don't tell him, okay?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That reminds me, he just went to the company building saying some weird stuff.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]He muttered about something not being enough⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What was that about?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I hear there was a little commotion at the briefing.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They said a male college student stepped in.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well I just want everything to go peacefully.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]A lot of the guys that work here are violent.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I think that Chief Arima is pretty cute, but man, she's cold.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I bet she doesn't care about us at all.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just what's going on with the company's safety standards?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This is life-threatening.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But if we get the order, we have to carry it out.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I think he said something about transportation work starting now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Is that all right?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I don't care how good the pay is. My life is more important.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They say these clothes are electrically insulated, but they're just covered in vinyl.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I don't know if they'd help against a lightning strike.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck must be for moving earth and sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if they just leave it out here, it'll be bad for the engine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That ocean breeze always blows at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what are they transporting? This is a geological survey, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's for transporting dirt and sand or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This ocean is so beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope the construction finishes soon so I can swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still hot and perfect for the beach, but no one's swimming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because of the construction, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi's in charge of it, so I can't really say much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can faintly hear the whispering of the waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is dark and quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the proper name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost nobody around here calls it that, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the sights of Sakaimachi. It's known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. It's night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright and blue, but it looks gloomy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction is on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the construction is on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they did just have crazy things happen yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a quiet construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nighttime now. There's no construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might not start again tomorrow, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But can lightning actually strike on a sunny day like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really know what it's like inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess there was an accident around here somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like there was a fire.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what a geological survey looks like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like they could do it on a smaller scale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the construction site's fence. Apparently they're doing a geological survey inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what I saw from the rooftop, it looked like they're digging up the beach for all its worth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a pretty nice place before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet all around. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's usually loud with all the rumbling from the construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like the construction is on hiatus.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All that rumbling from the construction is loud. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, guess I'll go to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I just came from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics, hmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm a little concerned about Ayumi. Okay, let's give it a shot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't imagine Mio would be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi might be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go, just in case.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I shouldn't go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is whether or not I can get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, he works at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means there's a high chance he'll be at the company building. Okay, let's check it out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should probably quit while I'm ahead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics, huh? Okay, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I heard there was a briefing or something about to start.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm worried about Ayumi. Is she okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to climb a pretty steep hill to get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, it'll tire me out, but I'll go to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I kinda feel like I want to go to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll head to Sakaimachi Academy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be a pretty big pain in the ass if the guidance counselor sees me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that's where I want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back home. I'm worried about Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll go back to the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are we going back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like that's where I want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll try going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. They said Ayumi went home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, straight back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I have anything to do at Triangle Mountain now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The first thing I need to do is find Ayumi and give her these documents.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When Mio was at the shrine, she used the expression, 「from here.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「From here.」 But where to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Yuuki saw it a few times, but I should just check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi at Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I'll try going to Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go to Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like that's where I want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going to the shrine at the foot of the mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make sure that bastard doesn't find me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, here I go.[%p]
