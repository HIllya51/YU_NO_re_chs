[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some kind of letters. No need to read them now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's said that they were written approximately 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be reading this now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That girl was on the ground here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was she, anyway?[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]It seems like she's not here right now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. That woman was on the ground by the rocks here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She⋯kissed me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But then she disappeared.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was she trying to tell me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is right there, as quiet as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]Was it all a dream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji drew a gun, and I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I was facing off with Ryuuzouji here just a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I look around here a little more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the way to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But before that, I need find out what happened to everyone.[%p]
