[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like she's not back yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, are you here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she hasn't come back yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means I came in uninvited again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯? But then, why was the door open?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. It's Houjou, that middle-aged guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That guy must have been going through her apartment. He's no better than a robber.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I came in here without permission too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bare fluorescent light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something sinister about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fluorescent light is bare.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are no curtains on the windows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she really live here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't even curtains in this apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing stopping you from peeping in⋯except that it's on the fifth floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The AC won't turn on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's broken.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't turn on. Is it broken?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an air conditioner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember there being a lot of people catching cold from too much AC in the summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not on right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't much medicine in this medicine box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just stomach medicine, bandages, and some pain relief patches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medicine box. Not much inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's either not used at all, or all used up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is probably where she eats.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's really nothing there though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing on the table but the medicine box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal table. Nothing out of place about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's trash inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be using it as a trash can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cardboard box.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I shouldn't rummage through her cardboard boxes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Inside is a kitchen knife and a pot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it really okay to open this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing inside besides a kitchen knife and a pot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a simple kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Empty cans⋯not a drop inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would empty cans be discarded here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's certainly not a single guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it makes it seem more like someone actually lives in this place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some empty cans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot of soda cans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be where she cooks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a simple kitchen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's pretty much nothing inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't make me open it so many times.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Opening the fridge will actually make the room hotter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the food was used this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing but milk inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm assuming the stuff Kanna eats is in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A small fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, refrigerator storage is measured in liters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it matters.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The fridge.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A small fridge for one person.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This bottle looks like it had alcohol in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone gets the urge to drink some times, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's odd.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Smells like alcohol. Must be the empty liquor bottles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Kanna drinks this all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one cup.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just one cup on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter where I look, the best word to describe this place is 「simple.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bankbook and a photo inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I take a look at it?[%p]
Look at the picture in the handbook
Don't look
[name]Takuya[line]There's a bankbook and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯an old picture. It must have been taken more than 50 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「With the one I love most」 on the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I shouldn't look at this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, that old bastard's bankbook was in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A bankbook. 「Koudai Arima.」 That's my old man's name.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An old picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a girl who looks like Kanna smiling in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「With the one I love most」 on the back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「With the one I love most」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that's why she's smiling so innocently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But who's the lady next to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She looks pretty nice. I'd even consider her beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she related to Kanna or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, where was this picture taken?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could it be⋯ Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, it's definitely Sword Cape. There's that big stone slab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one Twin Boulders in all of Japan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just noticed, but isn't this a little strange?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get a strange feeling looking at this picture.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is up with this picture?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cupboard for storage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be stored in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's for storing things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing seems to be inside it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one is sleeping right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the bed Kanna sleeps in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I slept in it for a little while this morning.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the bathroom right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good, looks like Kanna isn't in here this time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm⋯a bit disappointed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This room is too plain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I could call a girl's accessory around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Kanna's apartment, apparently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I say apparently because I can hardly believe it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she have any family?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she live by herself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is a simple apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does a girl really live here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I shouldn't just go in without permission.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why was the door unlocked? That's a little strange.[%p]
