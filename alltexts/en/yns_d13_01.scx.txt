[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio went to the next room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did she close the curtain?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sorry. It'll just be a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's taking her a long time, though.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, make yourself at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, aah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's from the other side of that curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she gathering papers or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Mio's bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't do anything stupid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff⋯sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mmm, smells like Mio. No doubt about it, this is Mio's bed.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, yeah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio is on the other side of the curtain next to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Mio's bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she sleeps here every day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture of her with an old guy. I've seen this old guy before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the mayor. Which means it's Mio's real father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture of her and an old guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a picture of Mio with her sugar daddy when they went to the tropics.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's ridiculous![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear her voice, but I can't see her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio is in the room next door. Maybe she's gathering papers or something on the other side of the curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She seems like a pretty dedicated student.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her field of study might be a little biased, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「48 S&M Methods」 and 「Bondage Tutorials.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That Mio is a minx.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't be ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Mio's gathering papers or something on the other side of the curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's this? 「An Introduction to History」 and 「A Record of Transitions」 and 「Ancient Japanese History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's my old man's work, 「A Book of Hard to Understand History.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio is an ancient history fanatic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light. It's keeping the room brightly lit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lights all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The room is bright. I like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's what they call a foliage plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a real plant, not a fake one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a lot of them placed all over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, it won't spin no matter how many times I look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And there's a big light attached to the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It really looks like it could spin around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯ Maybe I should go check on her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are there really that many papers?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa!!!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](S-She was changing?!)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This is the first time I've had a boy in my room and⋯ I want to look my best.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What clothes would be best for him?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmm⋯ I'm not sure.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]If it's too flashy, he might turn feral on me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But too plain is no good either.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not too flashy, with just a hint of womanly charm⋯ So, maybe this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She said she was gathering papers, but she's picking out clothes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I say that, yet I'm enjoying the view⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you done yet?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can help you get the papers together.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm coming in.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-No, you can't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why not?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]N-Not right now. If you come in here, I'll kick you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come on⋯ Time is important to me, too. I'm going home.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Wait⋯ Geez.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Sorry to keep you waiting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not too flashy, with just a hint of womanly charm.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh⋯ R-Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes⋯you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you look so satisfied? And what about the papers?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They're here, come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, quit making such a mess on the floor.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They won't all fit on my desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's quite impressive.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yeah, I had to work pretty hard to research and collect it all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This looks more serious than I thought.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, look at all those papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, are you done yet?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing? Come on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is taking forever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are there really that many papers?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess rich people like putting lights everywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are lots of different lights attached to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the closet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are probably clothes in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I kind of want to look inside but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that wouldn't be good. I'm not some creep who peeks into a girl's closet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a closet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I open it, I'll probably find clothes and underwear and things.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not opening it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a cushion. I shouldn't sniff at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must sit here pretty often.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who sits in the chair next to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a tea set, but it looks like there's nothing in there now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Give me some tea, at least.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's for drinking tea?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the real entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanna come in through here just once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where you'd normally enter the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I have to come in through the window?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair. That's easy to see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's here for sitting and relaxing⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Mio usually sits here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no particular smell to it. I'm half relieved and half disappointed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I so disappointed about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you it's a rug.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a rug.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's spread on the hardwood floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a table for tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's no tea now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she drinks tea here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wanna have some tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it's been tidied up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The room is simpler than I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm gonna leave, I want to leave from the door back there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I have to come and go through the window?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just got in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she'd bring the papers soon. I'll wait a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came in from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no reason to go outside.[%p]
