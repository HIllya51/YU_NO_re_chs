[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside. It's chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, I'm going⋯there?[%p]
「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't understand, but that's what's written.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Your current junction completion rate is :clrpar: percent.」 is what it says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some more writing⋯[%p]
「There are also other places where your 『Current Coordinates』 are noted, so please reference that as well.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A sign. What does it say?[%p]
「This sign displays your current completion rate.」[%p]
「Your current junction discovery rate is :clrpar: percent.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As much as humans destroy nature to put up man-made structures, they can't get away from it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a strange connection we have with nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There is grass here and there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants in my house, as well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sexy fliers inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that it would matter if there were. It'd just make me happy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now then, are there any fliers for video deliveries?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh! This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The electricity bill. We have been using the AC lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the gate. You got a problem with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tiled wall. It's not made of bricks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wall that surrounds the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why do Japanese people want to surround everything with walls?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The spaces are small enough as they are, but everyone puts up walls. Making it even smaller.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not gonna clean it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The windows for my room and the old bastard's study.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They might start getting dirty if we don't clean them soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A normal antenna for the local channels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It gets VHF and UHF. Should I be looking at that now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the perfect 「upper middle class」 house imagined by us middle class people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The house where Ayumi and I live.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Until two months ago, there was another, crazy guy living here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dark night sky. Like it'll swallow me up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. There's not many people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A quiet neighborhood. Probably because the ocean is relatively close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I keep walking, I'll arrive downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the city in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man wrote that I should go to Triangle Mountain tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I just have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the wrong way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What will ringing my own door bell accomplish?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm going in the house, I should just walk in.[%p]
