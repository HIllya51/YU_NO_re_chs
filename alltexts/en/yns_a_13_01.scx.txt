[name]Takuya[line]There's an important-looking pedestal in front of me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do I do?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Begone, fool who bears no jewels!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I thought there was some sort of pedestal here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I need to bring back 10 jewels?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Begone, fool who bears no jewels!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I thought there was some sort of pedestal here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I need to bring back 10 jewels?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The king's name, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that phrase again? 「Light and shadow⋯ When the demon and heavenly being come together, the king's name shall reveal itself above their heads.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I think that was it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must have input the wrong letters.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Begone, fool who bears no jewels!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I thought there was some sort of pedestal here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I need to bring back 10 jewels?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The king's name, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that phrase again? 「Light and shadow⋯ When the demon and heavenly being come together, the king's name shall reveal itself above their heads.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯I think that was it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Light and shadow⋯」
[name]Takuya[line]「When the demon and heavenly being come together⋯」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try entering it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll press the :btnSTART: after I'm done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, looks like nothing is happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I must have entered the wrong letters⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I can find a clue somewhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light and shadow come together, huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe that means they stack on top of each other?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Begone, fool who bears no jewels!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, I thought there was some sort of pedestal here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I need to bring back 10 jewels?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's right⋯ I've been meaning to check that pedestal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's some sort of inscription in the stone above it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something above it⋯like some sort of button.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What the⋯ What's going on?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]He who bears the mark of the king⋯ Answer![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Someone's speaking⋯directly into my head?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]((You shall⋯answer to my questioning!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Questioning⋯? What do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((What⋯is the king's name? Answer!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]King's⋯name?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((What⋯is the king's name? Answer!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]King's⋯name?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Light and shadow⋯ When the demon and heavenly being come together, the king's name shall reveal itself above their heads.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Light and shadow⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](When the demon and heavenly being come together⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯the king's name shall reveal itself above their heads.)
[name]Takuya[line](Does it want me to enter the king's name?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](King's name⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right, I'll try entering something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll just press the :btnSTART: when I'm done.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing's happening⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like something is supposed to happen if I enter an answer, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What letters am I supposed to enter exactly?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's an oddly oppressive feeling to it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And this thing in front of me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What in the world could this room be for⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everything from the walls to the ceiling is completely paved with stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This thing is built pretty damn sturdily.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are rocks on the ground⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There isn't anything of note on the floor⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just some rocks on the ground⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't seem like it's supposed to slide sideways, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
*bmbm⋯bmbmbmbm⋯*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ No good. I can't even get it to budge by pushing it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I can pull it instead of pushing⋯ Oh, but there's nowhere for me to grab hold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see a dividing line here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This wall is different from the rest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a button⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something else a bit more interesting right now, don't you think?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That thing in front of me⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a button there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's something else that I'm more curious about⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the entrance I just came from.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So I'm going back, then⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try using the PDA.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's the time to use items right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Looks like now isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
