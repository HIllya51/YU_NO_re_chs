[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't see anyone around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock is in place, so I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, where is that ancient history-obsessed girl anyways?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. I'm out at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'll be evening soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, I heard Yuuki is looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did he go home already?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's inside the school anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Phew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Geo Technics executive board meeting should be ending right about now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Ayumi went after that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Yuuki was looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like there are some people in the school. Must be club kids.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you, Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I'm at the front gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I got kicked out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He said the teacher got angry at him, but who was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it the guidance counsellor or the summer remedial class teacher?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, nothing to sweat over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now let's get going right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't Ayumi say she's got some kind of briefing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what that's about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. Looks like Ayumi isn't inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school gate. I think Ayumi's inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do, climb up there and pretend to be a cicada?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll say this: I don't like the plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. It holds those electric cables in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I explaining things like a dictionary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see it from here, but I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top one says 「Stop」 and the bottom one says 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's any space in the streets of Japan, these signs spring up like bamboo shoots.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's also true that looking at green makes you feel calm and relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these plants are here almost apologetically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they're not hurting anything so whatever, but I just don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's pretty bad to destroy nature only to turn around and say 「we love nature.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guardrail is tough enough to take a hit from a car.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course our tax dollars paid for it, so if anyone were to break it, they'd have to pay to fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I also pay consumer taxes, so that makes this guardrail partly mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mostly single story samurai mansion⋯ What an incredible structure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A traditional Japanese house with lots of nature around it. What a place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sparrows in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sparrows like to rest up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're stretched all around like spider webs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hot during the day, cold at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This asphalt is just like sand in the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really hot. I bet heat waves will come off it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The temperature of asphalt rises above 120 degrees at the peak of summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I'll be seeing mirages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school isn't very tall, but it's on a large property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd take a while to walk all the way around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this type of construction is called an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior design is actually pretty nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Sakaimachi Academy, the school I attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A safe name for a university, I guess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring up at the sky like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not many people around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, so I should have assumed that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, let's go back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I be going somewhere else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll try going back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I doubt Ayumi went back home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's the wrong direction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is off on an inspection. That means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I haven't found Ayumi yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I even come to the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline means construction. Construction makes me think of that creepy construction director.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might run into that jerk. Okay, I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I going to the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think that's the wrong way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, maybe if I go to Geo Technics⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the sea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's not where I'm going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't mean to hesitate with Yuuki, but running away just isn't my style.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, they should be doing construction at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is responsible for that, so I'm sure she's there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go to the coastline![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are other places I need to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, it's not time to go there now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to go see Ayumi first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock is in place, so I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock is in place, so it looks like I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought for a second Mio might be in the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard Yuuki was looking for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just what could it be about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we go inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew. If I get caught by the guidance counsellor, I'll have to go to summer remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to be careful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like I can't get in the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's locked. I wonder if Ms. Eriko locked the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Either way, it looks like I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but wait⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think the door automatically locks in the evening, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's open. Well, that makes sense. There are still people inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's go see what scolding I'm going to get from the teachers.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could be waiting inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They mentioned inspections⋯ That must mean there's an inspection going on inside the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even though I know it's wrong, my feet won't stop moving.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go inside the school![%p]
