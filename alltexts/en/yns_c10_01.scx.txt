[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there no one inside the school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here I am again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way a teacher would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why am I here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a little chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm on the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need a speaker right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Monaural, hmm⋯ Now that I think about it, I bet monorail is short for monaural rail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The trains are separated into east- and west-bound, but they don't call them stereorails.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems inconsistent.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the speaker for school announcements.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like it's monaural, so even if I brought it home, I couldn't hook it up to my AV amplifier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's closed. Looks like it's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, there's no need to open it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to get out of breath.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That harsh smell reminds me of paint or varnish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school. What is there to stare at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I go through here, I can go down to the second floor hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to sit anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hiyaaaa⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really don't want to keep doing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Chai![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aw, now I'm craving chai tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Puuush.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So now what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Making noise when I sit down makes me sound like an old geezer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to look at boring pictures.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some old Renaissance art depicting poverty and corruption.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm lying, of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shrub. It has nothing to do with that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's totally different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pretty rare to see shrubs on a rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Educators just seem to want to plant things. Do they feel guilty about nature or something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would I climb the wire net?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's there so students don't fall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Teachers might find a way to do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know why this lamp's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've been wondering if they turn off the electricity at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aaand it turned on. Of course. What a waste of power.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure the lamp turns on at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But no one comes here at night. I wonder why it's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too dark to see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a lightning strike there yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess there was an accident, but there's no smoke anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's smoke rising.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll look one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess there's construction. They say it's a geological survey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I look at the coastline?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say they're conducting a geological survey, but it's pretty large-scale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so dark and cold that I feel I could disappear into the night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I could punch right through the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that even mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at the sky makes me sleepy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The clouds are all puffy like cotton candy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no point in spacing out here, is there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go down to the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Staying here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lightning strike at the coastline⋯ Makes me wonder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go downstairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, staying here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go downstairs.[%p]
