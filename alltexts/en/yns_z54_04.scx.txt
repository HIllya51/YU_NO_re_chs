[name]Takuya[line]Celes?![%p]
[name]Man[line]Who are you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should ask you that![%p]
[name]Man[line]Can't you tell by looking at our clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your clothes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're covered in white armor.)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Clearly, he's just some country bumpkin. Otherwise, he'd know who he's dealing with, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you guys?![%p]
[name]Man[line]What kind of question is that? Didn't you listen to a word I just said? Take a look![%p]

[name]Takuya[line](Where is he telling me to look?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Pale legs⋯ Is that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way⋯ Celes?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Legs so pale, they're practically translucent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They look familiar.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got a bad feeling about this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Legs?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop joking!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You want to go outside now?!)[%p]

[name]Takuya[line](I can't go to the bedroom now!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No messing around. I can't go to the bedroom now!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did those guys hurt Celes?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No way⋯ What's that on the ground?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to get a closer look.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you![%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey! Hold her down.[%p]
[name]Man[line]I am. She keeps struggling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit! I can't hear anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These are the first people I've seen besides Celes and Yu-No.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're wearing weird masks, but they're definitely human.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they doing?)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Hey! Keep her down.[%p]
[name]Man[line]She's struggling.[%p]
