[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is picking up the papers.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Umm⋯not this one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm. She hasn't noticed me yet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]18, 19⋯ Where is the 20th page?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll be in trouble even if I lose one page⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no. What should I do? I can't find the 20th page.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This isn't it⋯and not this one, either⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on, notice me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, um⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I wasn't looking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hmm, she somehow doesn't seem to notice me.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All I need is the 20th page. Where is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you want me to help you with that stack as well?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, I'm fine. Thank you so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't done enough to be appreciated.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]By the way, why are you here, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Why? I don't really know.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This company's security is really tight. So⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I'm your immediate family, I can't get in, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Exactly. Please call me beforehand when you come. This is already the company's private property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh. Even your son can't visit the company?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, it's company policy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to apologize, Ayumi. I understand; I'll try to cooperate as much as possible.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Security is tight, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why? Isn't this just a company that performs geological surveys?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's quite a lot. It's difficult to carry, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, I guess so. But it was my fault that I dropped them. Besides, I should've bound the papers together to keep them from falling apart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean is also pretty strong.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes, the company building is on a hill, so the wind is even stronger.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Interesting.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]On a windy day, my skirt flips over and⋯ What am I saying? Oh dear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to be the wind right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is looking down and gathering the papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is trying hard to collect all the papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It must be an important document.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's staring at me.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ You look good in a suit, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, what's going on? You're acting weird today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Am I weird?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi always has her long hair tied in the back.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If she let her hair down, she'd look even more beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She smells good, particularly after a bath.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to think about that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't keep staring⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well it's just that⋯there's dust on your shoulder. Let me brush it off.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi always ties her hair when she's at work.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is tied up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It makes my fingers want to play with it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is holding them carefully.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to be those papers right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, it's an important document⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. I'll be in trouble if it disappears or ends up in someone else's hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What kind of document could it be?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She only has a few in her hand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's more on the floor than in her hand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means it'll be difficult to collect the remaining papers on the floor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's my stepmother, after all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me. I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Though I say that, I can't help looking because I'm a guy, you know.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, nothing. I was just thinking there are so many papers on the floor.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Exactly. Thank you so much for helping me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, quit it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can almost see it, but not quite. This is also kind of⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But this is not the time for that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no! Did she hear the onomatopoeia of my libido?!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This is bad⋯ These papers are important and⋯*mumble*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She ignored me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, the position of her foot is very dangerous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't lift it up so much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, if you lift it up any more⋯more⋯and more⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How nice of you to pick up the papers. But you don't have to bend down so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ Whew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't simply be happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh⋯ I'm getting kind of dizzy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is sitting down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is holding the papers, so that they don't fly away.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't even care about me. The papers seem to be more important.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is gathering the papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't even care about me⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you okay holding all of them? I hope it doesn't go to 「Return to Start.」 I can help you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm really fine⋯ Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, I told you. Geez. Oof.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This and this and⋯ Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this? 「SP Stone, Optical Resolution Report」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's got a lot of numbers and graphs. Hmph, it looks like a school test.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, don't look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you. I'll look for it again later.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew⋯ If you weren't here, four or five pages might have been lost. Thank you so much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why can't I look at it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like it's a school exam.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, the company has a confidentiality rule, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Confidentiality? What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Geo Technics is a for-profit enterprise, you know that, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So, in order to protect trade secrets, they have imposed an obligation on all of the employees.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An obligation?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The obligation of confidentiality.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In other words, it's an obligation to protect company secrets, huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. I trust you Takuya, but there's no reason why you should be an exemption to the rule⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Besides, according to internal regulations, there are no exceptions other than employees, so please don't feel bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if I look at them, it won't mean anything if I can't understand it, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, I guess you're right. Ah well, I should get going.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't overdo it.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, let me tell you a secret.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A secret?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You know News Presence, that show on tonight?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that TV program with the pretty newscaster. What about it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, you can count on it. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She went up the hill, her skirt fluttering in the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, no no, that's not what I should be thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, she said 「count on it.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Count on the news program?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Whew. This is the last of the stack. I need to be careful not to let the wind blow it away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems okay.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]This section is okay. I will be glad if you can pick up the papers around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, I'll pick these up around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder why she is panicking.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll pick these up and⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here you go, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you so much for your help, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll pick this up as well and⋯here you go.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you for helping, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are some graphs and things like that written on it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What kind of material is it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's quite a lot. Oof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And the wind from the sea is strong, so you have to be careful. Oops![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ahhh, no! Oh there, right there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't raise your voice like that. Someone might misunderstand you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing. Here.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thank you, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me help you, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, I don't even know you but thank–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eeek, Takuya! When did you come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was here the whole time.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh it was you, Takuya. I'm glad it wasn't my boss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch, that hurts. Is that because you think your stepson would forgive you more easily?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, I think I'll make you a great big dinner tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, okay, I forgive you. Here you go.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A stack of papers are on the floor.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Let's pick it up one by one.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There seem to be a lot of papers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This might take some time. All right, I'll help her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It looks like an important document.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She dropped them all over the place.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's likely to be dozens of pages.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi works for Geo Technics, so it's no mystery that she is here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm in front of Geo Technics.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi works for this company.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not the time to use that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is picking up the papers in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should help her first.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. It's not the time to use that.)[%p]
