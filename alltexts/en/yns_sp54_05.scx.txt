[name]Takuya[line]I'm all alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm all by myself![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's pathetic for a man to get hysterical.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The kitchen. No one's in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sign of Celes, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The table.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like eating anything.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't be serious. There's nothing but the light of the moon in the desert at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wouldn't even be able to see my own wallet if I dropped it right in front of me.[%p]
