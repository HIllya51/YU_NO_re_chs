[name]Houjou[line]Whew! What a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Geez, he smells like alcohol.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I have something to tell you. Okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe this guy.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What would you do if I told you Kanna was my woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Whoa! The look on your face could scare off an ogre! You've practically got flames bursting from your eyes![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't like people who tell bald-faced lies.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]How can you be sure I'm lying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll find out as soon as I ask her.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't be foolish.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do I know you're not just an alcoholic bastard spouting nonsense?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Fine. That's all right. You should ask Kanna directly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Ask her all about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'll say you're just an ugly bastard.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh, you should really ask her first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]There is no way Kanna would open her heart to a guy like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]That's it. Do your best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is that alcoholic bastard anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna is that bastard's girlfriend?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How ridiculous. There's no way that could be true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit. Why am I getting so ticked off?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So tell me what you want.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Fine. Who are you to Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my line. It should be a crime for disgusting old men who smell like booze to be associated with Kanna.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]How could you say such terrible things?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm just being honest.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hmph. Fine. I just want to say one thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Stay away from Kanna.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why should I?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I don't need to say it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I don't?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]The more you know, the more shocking the truth will be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truth?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It's better not to know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this guy trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Were you spurned by Kanna Hatano? Even if you wait for her, she won't come.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She won't go.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I should tell you, I know a lot more about her than you do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lot? You going to put in your two cents or something?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Are you playing dumb? Kanna is not as innocent as she looks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]And I mean that in every sense of the phrase. Do you understand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you trying to say you're in a romantic relationship?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't look at me like that. You're just another guy, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, sure.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]There's that look in your eye again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What does he want to say?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't look at me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want? I'm in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh. Young people these days⋯ They've got no manners at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I've got manners. I just don't want to waste them on you.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, well done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Drop the sly gangster act. You're just an alcoholic old bastard.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I get the feeling you don't like me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry. The world could end tonight, and I'd still have the same opinion of you.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]That's okay. I'm not looking for a fight. *hiccup*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He smells strongly of alcohol.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't get all fired up, kid.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Are you doing better now that our little chat is over?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oops! You're fast.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I've seen a lot of people in this business, but you're the first one to get the job.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What? Do you wanna touch it that badly?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Do you wanna smell it too? It smells pretty good.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You shouldn't touch that.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I've got pomade all over my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think he said his name is Houjou.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems to be acquainted with Kanna but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's the perfect vision of a middle-aged nobody.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this guy?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You young people just don't understand. Everything about my life is tainted.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hrmph. This is my best outfit. What do you have to say about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think he said his name is Houjou.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems to be acquainted with Kanna but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's the perfect vision of a middle-aged nobody.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this guy?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I guess a youngster like you wouldn't wear this color. Hmph.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Wow. You've got eyes.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I bought this on sale a week ago. Hey! Quit picking your nose and look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think he said his name is Houjou.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems to be acquainted with Kanna but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's the perfect vision of a middle-aged nobody.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this guy?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You're pretty observant.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You can watch people without looking menacing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think he said his name is Houjou.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He seems to be acquainted with Kanna but⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's the perfect vision of a middle-aged nobody.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this guy?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What are you trying to do? Get back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Why are you behaving so strangely?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
