[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the middle of the forest⋯ I could go straight toward the cliff, or go back to the hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a forest⋯ I can't help but sigh in appreciation of its beauty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An awful lot of trees here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's sunlight shining through the leaves⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place always makes you want to take a nap in the shade⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beautiful stream⋯ There were fish swimming in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I found out that quite a lot of fish are swimming in it, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe next time, we could go fishing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You want to go pick some more nuts from the trees?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's all kinds of nuts⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some are edible, and some aren't. The selection process can be challenging.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should reach that cliff if I keep moving forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This path should take me to that cliff⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I've got enough nuts⋯ Time to go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They should be waiting, too⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going back to the hill⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gotta take care of that thing first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should probably take care of that before going back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean our daily routine, obviously.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go back there⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah⋯ I wanted to go check out the cliff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's enough, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, let's get done with that daily routine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]More nuts?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I had enough but⋯ Okay, a few more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not the camouflage-colored ones⋯ The nutritious ones are good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take some from here, here, and here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm. It's getting heavy. I think this is enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think we need to capture any bugs now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe when I bring her with me, I'll make her happy running after the bugs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I remember⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I was a kid, I used to run around the mountain and fields with a net and a cage.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a lot of insects in the forest I've never seen before in my whole life.[%p]
