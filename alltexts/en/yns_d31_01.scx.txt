[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a complete mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should look around here some more before Mitsuki gets back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's unlocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that means I can go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't open this by myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a big padlock on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be a different story if I had a key.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This storehouse is half destroyed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not particularly strange. It's just a wreck.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like he lives here with his mother.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at this, what other conclusion could I draw? How could the two of them even maintain a storehouse like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The walls are really damaged.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one has done any maintenance on this storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a copse of trees⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Most of the greenery around here is from the copse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one has been maintaining it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is so clear, it makes me want to do a rain dance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And they say lightning is striking down at the coastline. How strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I can hear is the whisper of the wind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, I might be able to go into the back of those woods.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this atmosphere, it's no wonder people talk about this place being cursed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like something could pop out at me any second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something about it makes me curious. I should check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something farther in has me curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I check it out?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try going back.[%p]
