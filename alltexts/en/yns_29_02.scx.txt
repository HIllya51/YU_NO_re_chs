[name]Takuya[line]Just making it brighter makes a huge difference.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where Mitsuki is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe in the main house?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's fieldstone. I can't break it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are rocks stacked up. They're called fieldstones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That reminds me, I've heard that karate masters can break stones with their hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've heard that roof tiles are easier to break, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. It looks like there's no one in the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know where the entrance is, but someone will probably answer if I call out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is anyone here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a huge mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost all one-story. With the land scarcity in Japan now, it's like a crime to such a structure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Mitsuki waiting in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream. I don't need to swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stream in the courtyard. This place is nuts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like the headmaster makes a lot of money. Way more than my old man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't ride it anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will it break if I ride it?[%p]
Carefully⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, I think it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it, there's no way it would break if someone just my size got on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a stone bridge going across it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The arch shape can hold a lot of weight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound of leaves rustling together is calming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Mephisto Waltz.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「La Campanella.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Transcendental ⑭tudes.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Minute Waltz.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「⑭tude Opus 10, Number 3.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Fantaisie-Impromptu.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Beethoven's Fifth.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Appassionata.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「Farewell.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I'm listening to the classic piece, 「My Original Song.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The leaves and branches are rustling together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pretty nice sound.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sunny again today. There hasn't been any rain lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she's not there. Mitsuki isn't an alien.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsukiiii![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking over there won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsukiiii![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She isn't hiding under any rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow, there are so many pincher bugs and other little insects.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mitsuki be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So she called me over here, but where is the woman herself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If that's how it is, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't be able to go in the main house. I guess I'll check out the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If that's how it is, there's nothing I can do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't be able to go in the main house. I guess I'll check out the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try looking a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so big here. If I move around too much, we might miss each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try looking a little more.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second. Mitsuki isn't here yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with her? All she told me on the phone was to come here.[%p]
