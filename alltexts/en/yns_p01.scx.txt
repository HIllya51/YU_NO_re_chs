[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the key to the study in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why did I come back? That's the real question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, there it is. It's on top of the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, let's see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's about eight inches square and surprisingly heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't seem like a video tape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like something heavy is inside of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I open it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's wrapped up pretty tightly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's even got water resistant paper on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mirror and⋯something else?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Finally home. Today really dragged on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just sleeping on the roof though.[%p]
