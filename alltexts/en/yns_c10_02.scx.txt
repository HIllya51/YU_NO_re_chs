[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What was she doing looking at the ocean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I should change the subject.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This subject isn't good⋯ No good at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A subject, any subject⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looked like you were talking to Ryuuzouji earlier.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. The geological survey may be expanding, so I have to get Ryuuzouji's approval in advance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Expanding the geological survey, huh?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's because the construction is a little over due. The dig is taking time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The dig?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sorry, it's work stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Which means, don't ask⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, I have to get back to it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you have to be somewhere?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm holding a briefing for the local residents. I have to get their understanding about the company's policy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will getting their understanding be that easy?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It won't be easy, but it's my job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Getting the blessing of the locals for construction with so many accidents⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder if she can do such a thing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah! Something got in my eye.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek! The wind's lifting my skirt. Aah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What? Her skirt?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, why did something get in my eye right now?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow ow ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](M-My eye hurts even more⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, my tears won't stop running.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow⋯ Shit, I can't see anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm crying all over the place⋯ Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a nice smell⋯ And I feel someone's breath on me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't rub it. Hold still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gasp*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't rub your eye when something gets in it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Aww, look how red and swollen it is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That hurts⋯ Ow.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's okay, don't move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Leave it to me⋯ That's a good boy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*thump thump*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Look, there's something in your eye. Let me get it out for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sniff* Something smells good.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Ayumi's scent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can feel someone breathing right next to me⋯ Ayumi's breath.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It feels good⋯ Really good⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If⋯we could just be together like this.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I got it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, ah ha ha⋯ Th-Thanks.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Look at the size of this piece of dust you got in your eye. That must've really hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'll wipe your eye with my handkerchief. Stay still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's okay. You'll get your handkerchief dirty.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Just stay still.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's chest is pressing against me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wh-Why is my heart beating so fast?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's my stepmother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Okay, you're fine now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Aww, I wish we could stay like this longer.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong, does it still hurt somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I⋯ I'm okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe. You're so weird, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Well, I'll be going now. It's about time.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Wow![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What was that sound?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sounded like an explosion. What was it?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It sounded like thunder⋯ Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck's going on with Ayumi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking outside like she's about to climb over the handrail.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The only thing you can see from there is the coastline.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯ Ayumi said it sounded like thunder.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no. There's been an accident.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's smoke⋯ You must be kidding. Lightning in this clear sky?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I just hope no one was hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I have to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go with you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]No, this is my job. You just focus on your studies, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe there was a lightning strike in the middle of the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope Ayumi's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Besides⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you gonna do about your briefing?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]With all that happened to Koudai⋯ Oh Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't want you to worry any more than you need to, especially not about me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm not worried⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can tell. You're very kind, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not the sort of guy I am. You're giving me too much credit.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*smirk* Oh really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Really.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You're just like your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I really don't like being told I'm like that guy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All right, I won't say it anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She keeps treating me like a kid.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But being lonely and sad⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]If it would make him come back, I'd be as sad as I needed, but that's backward thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]To be honest⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uhm, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'd be lying if I said I wasn't lonely, but I'm so busy now that I don't have time to be lonely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that means you're living your life.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, I guess you could say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's too busy to be lonely.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe she doesn't want to make time to feel lonely.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But school is nice, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not that old to be nostalgic, are you? You were a student just a few years ago.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, but I went to an all girls school. Hehe, so this is new to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. W-Well⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I wasn't used to men being around at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's how the old bastard tricked you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ We can be tricked into happiness, too, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whatever.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I guess you're too young to understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm joking. You're already an adult, Takuya. I think you understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Tsk, I don't even wanna understand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The old man and Ayumi⋯ Argh, it pisses me off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why⋯do I feel this way?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's n-nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess it's still taboo to talk about the old man.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She also looks like she's not over him yet.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing out here?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, I was just looking at the coastline and thinking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Thinking, huh?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are your remedial classes finished, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, yeah. They are, so I'm pretty much finished.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Pretty much?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean totally finished. Maybe.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe⋯ Keep up the good work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I lied to her⋯ Sorry⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's glasses. They're hanging from her pocket now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She took her glasses off and hung them from her pocket.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So even if I'm just looking at her glasses, I end up looking at her chest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always puts her hair up when she wears a suit. I almost never see her hair down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd like to see Ayumi in a suit with her hair down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She usually keeps her hair up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now it's dancing in the ocean breeze.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi will think I'm a weirdo.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Listen, Ayumi is my stepmother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What kind of jerk stares at his stepmother's chest?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh no, I looked at it again.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? You keep lowering your eyes and wrinkling up your eyebrows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯ I've got a battle going on inside of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Larger than I thought⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gasp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](N-No no, I can't be looking there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, quit it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi never stops smiling around me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But the truth is⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's smiling and looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is nice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She always keeps her hair up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a tidy suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a neat suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You make anything look good, Ayumi, but that really looks good on you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]*laugh* Thank you. It's one of my favorites.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it all right for it to be blowing around that much?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who cares. It makes me happy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, that's a lot of wind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a little more⋯ A little more⋯*grunt*)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's wrong? Why are you bent over like that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I, uh⋯ I'm stretching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, is it all right for that to be flapping in the wind so much?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh, for what to be flapping?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, uh⋯ You know, the dust from the coastline.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh⋯ The construction workers have it tough, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart's just gonna keep beating faster.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't look too much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can do this!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*pant pant*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Argh, my willpower must be getting rusty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just a little more⋯ A little more⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gasp*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell am I doing? She's my stepmother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stupid. I'm so stupid.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey, do you feel okay? You don't look so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, ha ha ha⋯ I-It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh, you must be tired from studying. Good work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can never tell her the truth.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Grrrnnnn.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hrrrrnngh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, she's not wearing stockings.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I-Is this for real?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If that skirt just flies up a little more⋯*grunt*)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop it, now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Listen, the woman standing in front of me is my stepmother.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I suppose my Freudian 「id」 might want that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But my superego says, do it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯ It says 「don't」 do it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It would be bad if I messed that up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No way I can do that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's skin is pale and clear.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such beautiful skin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such clear skin⋯ It looks pale and soft.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's the handrail.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The handrail Ayumi is leaning up against.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it weren't for the handrail, Ayumi would be falling into the ocean.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like the coastline is under construction.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the ocean over there.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The coastline is under construction.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see the shore in the distance.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looking at the sky is killing me.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The weather is so nice today. Aaah, I just want to sleep with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-S-Sleep with me?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, taking a nap would be nice right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Oh yeah. Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I have to tire myself out like this?)[%p]
