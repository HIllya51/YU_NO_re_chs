[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The princess is the same as always.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That was inconsiderate of me. Really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It hasn't been that long since your father died. But when I'm focused on something, I forget what's going on around me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's okay, I understand.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What is that tone about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just thinking that's what's charming about you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she being quiet now?)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey! Th-This isn't what it looks like![%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long have you been there, Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I just got here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So he says.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You weren't coming, so I thought I'd check on you. Did I do something wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, it's fine. Sorry, let's go.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]That's right! Today we're going to Triangle Mountain and⋯ Oh, I'm not supposed to say that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ah, Miss Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You've gone and made Miss Mio sad again, Boss Man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about? I didn't say or do anything.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But she's so emotionally unstable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you know? Once a month, girls have this⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh⋯ I guess not.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh-huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That one's up to no good. Be careful.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Be careful? Of what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio just rushes forward when her mind's made up. You have to keep her in check.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah⋯ Hey, Boss Man, you seem to know a lot about Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen, I know everything about the girls at this school.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, you are the walking libido. Woah, sorry Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The princess looks like she's in a big rush, or maybe a panic.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, it does look like things will go poorly for Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Like there will probably be a police investigation soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did you hear that?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]It was in the newspaper. It seems the decision may be made as early as this afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](One of those board meetings.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know it's gone that far.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯is she okay?)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Because of that, the value, and uh, safety, of Triangle Mountain is in danger.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's why Mio's in a hurry. I see.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why don't you ask someone at the company? Oh, I guess they wouldn't tell an outsider.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yuuki![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're going to Triangle Mountain now?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]No, that's up to Miss Mio. I'll go anywhere she goes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* All right, get out of here. The princess is getting increasingly flustered.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Right, then Masakatsu Yuuki is off![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So Geo Technics will make some kind of decision this afternoon⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it's already the afternoon. Does that mean the decision's already been made?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's going to happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, you're still after that legend of buried treasure, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What buried treasure? That's not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's not?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's your father's theory. You know it, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that thing that happens every 400 years. More of a fairy tale than a theory.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Dr. Arima's theory proposes that main cause could be in the city itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think that the cause could lie in Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, you're a devotee of the old man's theory.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't really put it out there, but I think that stone monument is obviously man-made.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stone monument? You mean the Twin Boulders?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes. They say that the characters carved into the face are man-made, but the stones themselves are believed to be natural formations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There's a catch when it comes to carbon dating. For example, what if a meteor strike occurs? There would be a totally different result.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wow⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She would be pretty cute if she'd just smile quietly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But why is the princess like this?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your father, Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Your father was someone special. His theory was ahead of his time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the end, though, he was shunned by academics, forced to work on the fringes of scholarship.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]There are many famous scholars who were once outcasted by academia. He just took the same path.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're giving him too much credit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I'm not. *sigh* I wouldn't have to think about this so much if your father was still alive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If the old man were alive, huh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want that, too. Not that I miss him or anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't rest until I punch him at least once.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're an ancient history fanatic as always, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't say it like that. It's just academic curiosity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what are you gonna do at Triangle Mountain?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why do you want to know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yuuki mentioned something about it, but he didn't tell me much, so I thought I'd ask.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I already told you what's it's about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Already told me? So it's about how you wet your bed when you were little?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not what I said![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? You never wet the bed as a kid?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]W-Well, of course I did but⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you making me say?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm making you say you're a bed wetter, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I feel dumb just talking to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Yuuki?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I asked him to go back to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you researching something in the lab again? Yuuki must have been so bored.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sure he wasn't. He sincerely listens to everything I say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Knowing him, I'd say that's about right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But when I'm with you, Takuya, I end up telling you everything⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something you don't want me knowing about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You'll stop me. I'm sure of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop you? Stop you from what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that I really care. You and Yuuki can do whatever you want.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Do you really have to say that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why's she so mad all the sudden? What a strange chick.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks like she wants to talk about something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should talk to Mio.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with that sharp gaze again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've gotten used to it though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That flowing hair of hers⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's beautiful, but I could never say that to her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your hair is curly as always. I like it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh? Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, you know, I like⋯curly fries.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've looked enough, now it's time to touch and taste.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]How about a taste of my fist?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're very extreme lately.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like you're a 32C to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pretty nice tits, I'd say.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, don't go judging my body right in front of me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then what size are you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why would I ever answer that?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your super dark nipples.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]D-Don't be ridiculous! My nipples are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, they're what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about your nipples?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You want me to kick you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, don't get so angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio looks good in her casual clothes, too.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're starting to look like an old man, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your skirt is pretty damn short, you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm sorry I can't show it to you on the screen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those are some pretty fashionable threads. No uniform, even though we're at school?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not like I wear my uniform 24/7, you know. And this school actually gives us the freedom to wear whatever we want.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really liked how your uniform looked.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait⋯really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay then, I guess I'll have to wear it for you tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't say I liked you. I said I liked the uniform.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm such an idiot. Whatever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you so mad about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I got this as a birthday present when I was little.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's very important to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Jewelry? Aren't you still a student?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, you sound like my dad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'm your daddy in a different sense?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you some kind of idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, she's snobby but certainly pretty.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Full hips, a tight waist, and a plentiful bust.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use trying to charm me with all that. If you want to charm me, you'll have to take your clothes off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, when are you going to get to it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't have time for morons like you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
