[name]Takuya[line]It's Illia's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Celes have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Celes isn't here. Let's look elsewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems that there is no sign of any people around, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a house in the middle of a rather large field.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where did Celes go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet here. It feels so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to Illia, this place is pretty wild.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She called it the Border.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A house made of stone. Illia's house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that's it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wooden architecture keeps it relatively cool inside because the warm air escapes outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone gathers in the center of the room, that's how the circle of warmth is formed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Therefore, it is a hypothesis that this style will be seen more often in ethnic groups who value peace and wholesomeness.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the contrary, stone houses do not let warm air escape outside, meaning that it is warm all around inside. So residents can do whatever they want, wherever they want inside the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some scholars analyze their architectural styles as the prototype of individualism, which is common in Europe and the United States.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not like Celes is going to appear just because I thought of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In Japan, we basically have more wooden structures⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These people may be a living in a relatively individualistic culture since this was built from stone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯ You're asking me why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels like it was built by piling up stones⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Architectural style of solid stones⋯ This is unusual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is quite difficult to pile up these stones, though⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who built this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the surface of the stone, it seems like there are thin layers of moss⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It means that this was not built today or yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like a mushroom⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you touch it, it will spit out smoke like spores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you touch it, it will spit out smoke like spores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough* *cough*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*spit* Eww, it spit out some spores⋯ Ugh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Strange plants⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have never seen this plant before⋯ It looks like cotton on mushrooms.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, are we going inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. If she's not around here, there's only one place left to look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't seem to be anywhere around the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should try looking somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she were around, she'd answer. Oh, wait, she doesn't speak.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'll have to look for her with my eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just glancing around, it doesn't seem like any one is here.[%p]
