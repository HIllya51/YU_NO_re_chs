[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯ What was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that sound?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is it coming from?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater. The sound isn't coming from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Trees don't make buzzing sounds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Over there. I heard something from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way. Is it coming from beneath the sand dune?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That can't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's coming from over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck must be for moving earth and sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound isn't coming from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think it's a truck horn.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It sounds like it's coming from further away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound isn't coming from the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain has nothing to do with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that noise⋯a siren?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, you think that's the sound of radio waves?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way that sound could just come from the sky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, it's not coming from the construction site.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound is coming from over there![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's from further away. Maybe on top of that hill?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound is not coming from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Higher up the hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it sounds like it's coming from Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that sound? It sounds like a siren.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's running this way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're running right at me. They seem quite dexterous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are they running over here from Geo Technics?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, they're getting closer![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Eek.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eek?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ow, ow, ow! Look where you're going you⋯
oh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ow, ow, ow! Look where you're going you⋯oh?
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, you're⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe, what a coincidence. Let's see. Takuya Arima, was it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And you are⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey!!![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, this is bad![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll leave the rest to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]L-Leave what to me? What are you doing, hiding behind me like that?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey! Grab her–[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Female Guard[line]Ow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the security guard, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Ahhh, you're⋯ Who are you again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm Takuya Arima. I'm pretty sure I've introduced myself to you before.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Arima⋯ I think I've heard that name before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on⋯)[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Wait, you're her accomplice![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Accomplice? Why are you making it sound like I'm some criminal?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You are aiding and abetting that woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aiding and abetting? You make me sound so bad. Who's really the one helping people commit crimes here?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]If you're protecting her, you'll end up guilty of the same crime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea what you mean. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You can only feign ignorance for so long. Breaking into Geo Technics? You must have nerves of steel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! Breaking into Geo Technics?! Who did that?![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯you mean the person behind me?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Aren't you her accomplice?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Get outta here with that. I just happened to be walking by.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Then hand that woman over to me right now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hand her over?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]This is interference with official police duties![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're not a police officer. You just work at the company.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Well, you're right, but⋯quit stalling! Do you have any reason not to hand her over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She just got behind me on her own.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Aww, you gave me away, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Mmm, I guess it was a bad idea to rendezvous here. Let's run for it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, what are you–[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I knew it! Prepare yourselves!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, I didn't do anything![%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're under arrest!!![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whoops.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Yahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She tripped and knocked herself out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this security guard?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe, I tripped her. Just like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just who do you think you are?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm Kaori. Kaori Asakura.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. I've seen News Presence plenty of times.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, I'm so glad to hear that. So you watch me on TV.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You really gave it to Ayumi⋯my stepmother tonight.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]There are two sides to that story, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I wanted to talk about! That lady said you broke into Geo Technics![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, being broken into certainly makes her and the other security guards look bad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I⋯ Wait, did you really break in?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No one will ever know for sure. Hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, here come reinforcements.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Reinforcements?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, fresh soldiers. They're coming from Geo Technics, one by one, just like ants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're right. D-Did Geo Technics really have an intruder breaking in?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Gotta go. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck was all that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The guard is knocked out. I should take care of her.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What? You again?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you think you're doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does it look like? I can't just leave her here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you some kind of idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're getting on my nerves! You have no right to say that to me. We don't even know each other.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm saying that out of the kindness of my heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing in the universe that would necessitate you calling me an idiot.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Quit your grumbling. If we don't get out of here fast, we'll get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would I get caught for? I didn't do anything.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You ever heard of subjective thinking? The point is what they think, not what you did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A guard is injured and knocked out. Next to her is a random stranger. Doesn't that seem suspicious to you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why would that mean I have to run away?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You don't get it, do you? Geo Technics got broken into, and that means the security guards must be really upset about losing face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]The last thing they can do to barely recover their loss is to catch the intruder.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not the intruder.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Didn't I tell you to think outside of your perspective? They need a culprit. You are just another man near the scene of the crime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, so you're saying they're going to scapegoat me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well done. You're smarter than you look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Heeeeyyy! You two! Don't move!!![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]See? Here they come. With eyes so intense, you know they think it was you who did it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?! But you're the culprit![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let's get out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no need for me to run.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You're under arrest!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I'm not running away. I'm just going to the place I want to go.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* Do as you please. Bye now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]You there, young man! Don't move![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, why do I have to run?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Either way, I think I'd better get out of here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound isn't coming from the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So that means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way that sound could come from there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sound isn't coming from Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think this is the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use that item.[%p]
