[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was Ryuuzouji⋯looking for something in the laboratory?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like Mitsuki said something about that before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji said he was looking for something, or whatever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki called me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure Mitsuki left the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Remedial classes are over, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't see Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I know where I'm supposed to go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the only one here. It must be because remedial classes are over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. It's quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They must still be holding remedial classes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. Unlike the main hall, it's quiet up here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. Where is Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That bastard Yuuki isn't here either. Shit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. I'm boycotting the remedial classes for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shouldn't I look for Ayumi first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sitting in the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof, I'm getting old![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ha⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bench; a place to take a load off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do old men always make so much noise when they sit down?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I feel like that's a deep question.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I think this is mostly for Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what I really don't understand is why there's so many cigarette butts in the ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I thought smoking was banned on campus grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, they never explained what the penalty was for smoking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this point there's only some kind of academic penalty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ashtray for the ashes of chain-smoked cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why is there an ashtray in the middle of a school hallway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stairs to go directly down to the school gate are through the emergency exit on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I follow these directions⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I run into the glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know: it's the sign that indicates emergency exits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've never used this thing before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I guess not having to use it is a good thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hose wrapped up inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light's on. What a waste of electricity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This light's on even during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They should think of something a little more eco-friendly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light. It's on even during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so bright out. Is it really necessary for the light to be on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I think this is mostly for Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what I really don't understand is why there's so many cigarette butts in the ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn, I thought smoking was banned on campus grounds.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then again, they never explained what the penalty was for smoking⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At this point there's only some kind of academic penalty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An ashtray for the ashes of chain-smoked cigarettes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why is there an ashtray in the middle of a school hallway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Down leads to the main hall, up goes to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're convenient stairs that let you go up or down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing too special, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a sticker indicating the emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you're inside, this is an exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you look at it from the outside, it'd be an entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The emergency exit sticker is stuck right on the window glass.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is obviously an emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A familiar indoor plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're all over the place, just like convenience stores.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Somebody must be cleaning this every day. The window is always nice and clean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is nice and wide.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With this much light being let in, it sure gets bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A handrail. I can't take it home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The handrail is here so you don't go flying off of the stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, I've never held this handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night. The hallway is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hallway is so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor. There's no one here but club members and people attending remedial classes, so it's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's here. Everybody must have gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I use this, it's a straight shot to the school gate. I'd actually just be going down the emergency stairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, let's go to the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]C'mon, I have somewhere to go, remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take the stairs down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I can go down to the school gate from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The place I need to go is right in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get outside through this emergency exit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can swing right down to the front gate. Okay, I'll give it a try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Should I go up to the roof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be going up to the roof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think there's somewhere I'm supposed to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll go down to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just came up to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Fine, I'll go down to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Down to the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think anyone's in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do wonder what Ryuuzouji was doing in there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take a look inside the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I kinda feel like I want to go to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Mitsuki's there though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well, I'll give it a try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I kinda feel like I want to go to the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no real reason, but I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I had plans with Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was supposed to meet her in the lab. I wonder if she's already there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll go check out the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory, huh? Okay, I'll give it a shot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The laboratory. I saw Ayumi here the day before yesterday.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I might see her again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
