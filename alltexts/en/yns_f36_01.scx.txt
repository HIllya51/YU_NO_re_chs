[name]Takuya[line]What do I do? I have to get out of here quick.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Ayumi isn't here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't stay here any longer. Maybe I should use the Reflector?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Or I could go back to the main menu and start with 「Keep Map and Items as is.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]The card is here. We can go in![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Okay. Open it right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They'll think I'm some kind of criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to do something![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Where's the card?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]It'll be here right away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's only one way out of here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hey, this door won't open.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Someone hurry and bring the card![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to get out of here fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm interested in those drafted plans⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't have time for that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The samurai mansion and Triangle Mountain⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are some kind of drawn plans⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain on the left, and on the right⋯ What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Blueprints of what looks like a samurai mansion⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Ayumi draw this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And where is this samurai mansion supposed to be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a machine that makes drafts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what Ayumi uses to draw up plans?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you planning to hide in the computer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's come up with a more realistic escape plan⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she uses all these machines by herself⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's gotta be a reason for having two different kinds⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are a bunch of machines on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can't fully utilize a CAD system with just a computer⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what Ayumi always says.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something smells good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the time to be doing that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be Ayumi's chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's nice and fragrant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This must be Ayumi's desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's another one over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi uses this desk⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must do a lot of work on here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like it blows comfortable air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A ceiling AC unit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, AC is short for air conditioner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring at the ceiling light won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling light. It's night time now, so it's on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A ceiling light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even if it's sunny outside, the inside of this room is pretty dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess that's why the light's on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I have to get out of here fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a teapot. I'm not thirsty now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You could use the items around here to pass the time drinking tea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if Ayumi put her lips on any of these cups⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she read magazines over here during her breaks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the time to take a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she read magazines over here during her breaks?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This desk is probably for breaks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a teapot and some other stuff here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this the time to look at the chair?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That chair looks rather uncomfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This chair doesn't look very comfortable.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't get outside from the door on the left.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hmph, so you found me out, Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]T-Toyotomi?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, you did well realizing I was hiding here. You have my praise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't get what you're saying, but I can't believe I found you hiding here.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's what I just said.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hey, that's my line. I'd like to know the reason why an intruder like you is trespassing here so late at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ah, so you can't answer. Then let me answer instead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Your stepmother, Chief Arima, was in a very precarious position.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Unable to avoid the growing complaints due to the accidents, the chief sensed her research was at an end. So, she came up with a plan to save herself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]There's only one person with complete knowledge about our current research: Ayumi Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]If she stole the research data, it'd cause the research to grind to a halt, buying her time to avoid disaster and find a way out of the situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this guy talking about?)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That was her plan, but she had to think on how to carry it out. She would have to steal the data herself, otherwise it'd be a major problem if it was really lost. So what does she do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It's simple. She has someone she can trust steal it for her. Of course, this is all an act.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]With this idea in mind, Ayumi Arima would certainly ask the person she trusts the most to help her out. Which happens to be you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't understood a thing you've said.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm explaining the reason why I found you here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You came here to steal the Hypersense Stone from the laboratory for Ayumi Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up. Ayumi knows nothing about this.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Right, she doesn't know a thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Whether she knows or not isn't the problem here. What's important is how it seems.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't be stupid.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Think about it. It's not necessary for the information the police want to hear and the truth to be the same, is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. So, I'm some stupid burglar who came here because his stepmother asked him?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, exactly. You're a scoundrel who came to steal the Hypersense Stone under the orders of Ayumi Arima, the former head facilitator.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Well, I wasn't expecting you to come in here. You're supposed to take the Hypersense Stone from the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I did that, my fingerprints would be all over the place.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It seems you're not stupid. Your role is over once you give her that stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Give her the stone?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Mhm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. I broke in here with Kaori⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she in on this, too?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, that took you long enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori⋯who is she, really?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hahaha. I suppose I can tell you. That woman calls herself a journalist, but she's actually a corporate spy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A corporate spy?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]She infiltrates a company and steals information. She uses it for blackmail or sells it to a rival. This creates a scandal, which she then covers on her show.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]She says she enjoys her work, but she's just hungry for money.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]That's a big accusation. You're the same, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Behind me?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kaori and Toyotomi are working together.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sad to see it turn out this way⋯ I wasn't planning on tricking you.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Now what? We won't get his fingerprints on the water tank like this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I guess it can't be helped. Let's go with what we got.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph, you should be grateful for all my help.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sure. I'll give you some of what I earn. No complaints, right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Your employer is that school's–[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Stop. Don't talk about it here.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmph. Fine. What about security?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I already called them. They'll be here soon.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]All right, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel dizzy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit⋯ It was a trap⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kaori is a corporate spy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's working with Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe it⋯ What's gonna happen to me?)
[name]Voice[line]Look over there⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]He can't be far⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Have you searched this room?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]No, not yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's aching⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My head⋯hurts.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is just like a hangover⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That sounds like something a college student would say⋯ Hahaha⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ugh⋯ Shit⋯)[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Next, check over there⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I'll search this area⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I keep hearing voices⋯ Sounds like they're in a hurry⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's going on?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, I⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, I was⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-My head hurts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why does it⋯ Oowww![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I've got a huge lump on my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like I have a second little head growing. Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm⋯starting to remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I came in here with Kaori⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori went somewhere, and I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was talking to Toyotomi in Ayumi's office.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's it! Toyotomi and Kaori?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's only been a few minutes.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Look over there⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]He couldn't have gotten far⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Did you search this room?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]No, not yet. However, this was the former head facilitator's office⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]There's no time to spare. The stone was stolen, so we need to search everywhere![%p]
[name]Voice[line]I never thought we'd have two break-ins two nights in a row⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Just keep searching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I fell right into their trap. Shit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do? The guards are about to barge in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to get out. Shit, I can't believe Kaori tricked me so easily⋯ She won't get away with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, how am I getting out of here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go into the corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That door goes nowhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The window doesn't open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The only way left⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door⋯ No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a drawer. I don't need it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is built into the wall. I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see the construction site near the ocean in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky, the trees, and the ocean are all out there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is the perfect work environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around won't help me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to do something, fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around here won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Okay, let's open the electric lock. Bring the card![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, those security guards are outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just staring around the room isn't going to get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looking at that won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi isn't here⋯[%p]
