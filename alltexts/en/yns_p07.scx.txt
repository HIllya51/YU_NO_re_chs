[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can get to the lab and the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the 2nd floor corridor. The only thing above me is the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I've fulfilled my duties here for the time being.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mission complete. Time to go.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, hey Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The second floor corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, M-Mitsuki⋯ I mean, Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You can call me Mitsuki. Long time no see, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, it's been a long time.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I guess I should be calling you Arima now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't matter what you call me.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yet you were so worried about it earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you here with Ryuuzouji?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. I'm his secretary, you know. I quit my part time job teaching here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, really?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, I only started working here because it was a good part time job.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I really liked your history class though.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Thanks. Things got really busy at my main job, so there was no helping it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your secretary job?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Yes. Mr. Ryuuzouji asked me to stop teaching because it'd be too hard to do both.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it because of⋯well, you know⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Mr. Ryuuzouji has been very busy lately, which means a lot more work for me. That's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is everything okay? You look pretty serious.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I read about your father in the papers. I'm sorry for your loss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd like to think the opposite about it. The painful life we've been living not knowing if he's alive or not is over.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a matter of perspective. Whether he ended up dead or alive, not knowing what happened⋯that was the stressful part.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all. Once everything is clear–black and white–things get surprisingly easy.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Oh really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Good. I thought you'd be more upset.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And if I were?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I would have cheered you up again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't seem very depressed lately.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe. I learned how to separate my private and work lives.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're all grown up.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]What about yourself?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even have time to be depressed.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Do your best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You too.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I at least⋯reached a conclusion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I have to go see Mr. Ryuuzouji now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Keep your chin up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki seemed a bit lonely.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That door leads to the lab.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They call it a research lab, but that's just where teachers hang out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what I'd have to do there, but I guess I'll check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school corridor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The air conditioning makes it nice and cool in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Woah![%p]
[name]Male Student[line]You should be careful⋯[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]If it isn't the club chief. It's my lucky day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Who am I? I'm your number one underling, Masakatsu Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I think I remember someone by that name in my club.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Please don't forget me, chief.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop calling me chief. I already left the club.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]How about Mr. Prez then?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Always with the jokes, Yuuki.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hahaha, no need to compliment me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Then how about I call you Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care what you call me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm just trying to be respectful of my seniors, that's all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, what are you doing here anyway?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]I'm⋯standing here.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Ow![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh, I'm breathing.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yes, I'm alive, too.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Quit slapping me please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your joke was so funny, I had to give you a prize.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Was it that funny? I'm glad I stayed up all night thinking of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a weirdo.)[%p]
