[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, no⋯ What do I say?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks sort of different than usual.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya. This is awful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Toyotomi told me this afternoon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Told you what?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He⋯ He said he was very hurt by your accusations, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? But it's all true![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please. I want you to stop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he⋯ That bastard is the one who's wrong![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Do you have proof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well, no.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, it's a big deal to call someone a criminal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Damaging someone's reputation can have legal consequences. You should know that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got to be kidding. He caused the accident. He used those yakuza–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Why can't you understand? If he takes legal action against you, what am I supposed to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]How can you know he wouldn't?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He's an adult, and he's very kind to me. I trust him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You have Mitsuki, Takuya, so it's okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Come on, you were kissing her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, well⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You have the right to love whomever you want, and I have no right to stop you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I will search for my own new love. So that's enough for now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No it isn't. That's a different subject.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not different. It's not your fault, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about you, Ayumi?! You were with that bastard in the other room.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit. I shouldn't have said that⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Y-You saw us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Y-You were watching us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't say it like that![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I saw you. I saw you and that bastard together.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to be taking it easy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I have to go after her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just wanted her to understand. How did it get so messed up?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just when she needed my support, I started an argument.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm such an idiot⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, there's something I want to tell you. It's about that bastard.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi. He's been acting strange lately.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You can't say things like that. He does a lot for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like what? He opened up your desk and was trying to take these documents.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's because he needs them for the meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And he said he was the acting head facilitator.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]He was just being hasty. If I get demoted, he'll get the position.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he was the one who instigated the accident yesterday![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The accident is the company's responsibility. Toyotomi is not to blame.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I'm saying. There was a tragedy because he forced construction to continue.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you talking about the transportation work?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There's no relation between the transportation and the lightning strikes. You can't say the accident was his fault just because he forced the transportation to continue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what about the yakuza he hired to attack you?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on, have you thought about that?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I, uh, I'm sorry about earlier.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Earlier⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I lost my head a little. I'm really sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, so did I.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, I have to clear up the misunderstanding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It should be easy to talk about it now.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It was the first time I've seen you with someone like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that. Uhm, well what I mean is⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So⋯ How long have you been together?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not how it is.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's not?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki is, umm⋯ Look, there's nothing between us.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]So her name is Mitsuki?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]She looks older than you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sh-She is, but⋯it's not like that.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's okay, I was just surprised. I support your love life, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, it's not like that⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it, how can I explain this?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it true you're going to lose your job?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯ I'm really worried, and⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]The order hasn't come down yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I still don't know what will happen. It could be even worse⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]But I haven't been stripped of my position yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So that's why the bastard said that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, he ran off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is always beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it just my imagination, or is she not as cheery as usual?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's hair is tied up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not the situation for that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop looking at your stepmother's chest.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's her regular business suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not how it feels⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it just my imagination that she seems different than usual?)[%p]
