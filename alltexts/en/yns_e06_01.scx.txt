[name]Takuya[line]It's the main hall⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It always makes me wonder. Is it okay for the school security to be this lax?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just walked right in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The main hall is as noisy as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost scary quiet when there aren't any people, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school is so quiet without all the people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The first floor main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the school's main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bell just rang so remedial classes must be over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there are still a lot of students here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People from remedial classes and club activities.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be people from afterschool clubs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's an unusual amount of people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back when it was in style, someone put lighting all over this room. It's stupid, really.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All it does is make my eyes hurt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's what they call indirect lighting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Indirect lighting is supposed to be done with some kind of padding on the cover or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night now. They must be doing oxygen breathing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel stuffy, but at the same time⋯ I don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now that I think about it⋯ Plants perform photosynthesis during the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it should be increasing oxygen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See, it's this thing's fault⋯ Plants take in oxygen, which increases CO2 in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why it's so stuffy in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is probably the only one using it, since she's the school doctor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why is there an ashtray in the school's hall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it for guests?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a circular sofa.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to be some kind of artwork.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An 「exhibit.」 That's what it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a strange object hanging from the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard it's supposed to represent the sun.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know who drew the big picture there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's supposed to represent the sun⋯ I think I learned that when I started here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone told me that skylight opens.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How do you open that? It is electric?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A skylight window. The stars are beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stars are shining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a skylight to bring in more light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes it bright and pleasant in here.[%p]

[name]Takuya[line]There's more written below⋯[%p]
「Be on the lookout for your current completion rate as well. Please use these in conjunction with each other.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there are any new postings.[%p]
「Refer to this bulletin board for your coordinate values on your map.」[%p]
「You are currently in coordinates :mappos:.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it mean? I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have the strength.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmph, so I'll fail once or twice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I won't do it again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*rustle*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got a nosebleed so bad it's dripping onto your fist, you dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just be going then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She doesn't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What doesn't she know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll ask. Hey![%p]
[name]Student[line]Never heard of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The people attending club activities look much more relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are all those guys in remedial classes?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You may not see it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know everything about the school, but I know a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a school building directory.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary and offices are on the first floor down the hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our classrooms are on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel like doing that now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Standing around in the school hallway isn't going to get anything done.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Aaah, Hatano⋯[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]H-Hey, why are you trying to hit me?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Aaah, just once, I should've asked Hatano to play that forbidden game with me.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Um⋯ Why are you hitting me?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh, there was a beetle on me? Oh, thank you. My face is broken, though.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]But that Hatano, it seems she's popular with certain male students.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]If there's a school slut, it's Kanna Hatano.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Um⋯ Why are you hitting me?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh, there was a cicada on me? Oh, thank you. My tooth is broken, though.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Woah, that scared me. I can't believe that Hatano⋯[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Oh man, if I knew that about her, I would've had her pop my cherry.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Um⋯ Why are you hitting me?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh, there was a mosquito on me? Oh, thank you. My nose is bleeding, though.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]What is Geo Technics doing on the coastline?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Is it really just a geological survey?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I can't believe the mayor and Geo Technics were in a cozy relationship. That was a pretty shocking report last night.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Embezzling public funds for construction. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]That's getting me worked up.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Man, that Kaori Asakura from News Presence is the best.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]She's been in the spank bank for a while.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Oh, is that not what you meant?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]That's what I meant.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]There's a lot of natural disasters lately.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]That earthquake might've been bigger than normal.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I've been hearing these loud noises from outside. What's going on?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh, you don't know because you were having a nice moment in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Okay, I'll have to use the school infirmary from now on![%p]
[name]Male Student[line]By the way, the girl I'm talking to is just a normal student.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]She's not a slut.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]Huh, Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]There's a popular rumor that she's easy. I wanna do her just once.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]But according to some people, she asks for a lot of money.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I work and work. Just staring at my own hands.[%p]
[name]Male Student[line]I don't have a job, actually.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]*sigh* There are so many girls who are more mature.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Maybe I should lose my virginity with my boyfriend.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There was a girl who quit school because of an illicit affair.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I hear it was someone in Ms. Takeda's class. So I guess she was third year.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]So many mature girls at this school⋯*sigh*[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, we're talking.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I'm talking to him about last night's news right now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Of course it was the number one-rated, News Presence.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]We're not 「not」 really talking about not 「not」 breaking up.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Do you know which one it is?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, sorry. I'm in a complicated conversation now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]We're breaking up.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh come on, don't look so down.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, we're talking now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]A rumor? Sorry, not interested.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]But I think this person knows a lot of rumors. Why don't you talk to them?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Oh, you already did.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, I'm talking to this person now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't want them to destroy Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That's right, the construction on the coastline is on hold now.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Rumors say that construction will start on Sword Cape soon.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Huh, Kanna Hatano?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't know that name. Is she in a different class?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Lightning doesn't just strike from a cloudless sky.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I hear there was an accident at the coastline last night.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Maybe it was lightning. Heehee, as if.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I fell asleep looking at the stars last night. There couldn't have been lightning.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, I don't really know.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Yeah, Hatano.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Not many good rumors about her.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What I hear is that she's good friends with a lot of guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I also hear that she does business with dingy old men.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I guess those looks fool all the guys. So stupid.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I mean, my boobs are bigger than hers.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]There was another accident on the coastline. It seems bad.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That reminds me, there was a girl that's always saying there will be another accident.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]She was a third-year student. I think she was a transfer student.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Sorry, I don't really know.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Speaking of rumors, you don't hear about the curse lately, do you?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What, you don't know? You're so behind.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That old samurai mansion you can see from the school gate. Do you really not know?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Then go ask someone about it.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Hatano? I don't hear good things.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]What I hear is that she's good friends with a lot of guys.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I also hear that she does business with dingy old men.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I guess those looks fool all the guys. So stupid.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I mean, my boobs are bigger than hers.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I hear that she decided to quit school on her own.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Well, I guess it was inevitable with all those rumors.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]By the way, did you hear?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The third-year, Hatano. Looks like she was having an illicit affair.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Hatano has some weirdly mature things about her⋯[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]Maybe it's because she has experience with men.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't hear very good things about Hatano.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That reminds me. The school physician Ms. Takeda and Hatano just took off somewhere.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I wonder where they went.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The weather was so clear, and then lightning?![%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I don't really believe it.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I hear there was a lightning incident.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]You know that big shake like an earthquake before? That was from an explosion at the construction site.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The weather is so clear. Don't you think that's strange?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]The weather's been so nice lately, there couldn't have been any lighting, could there?[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]That reminds me, there was a girl saying there will be more lightning.[%p]
[name]Schoolgirl[line]I think it was that third-year, Hatano.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Yes? What?[%p]
[name]Student[line]There is something interesting written on this bulletin board.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Hey, long time no see. Nice to see you again.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got good news to share, but it's kind of a long story.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]It takes a while to explain, but do you wanna hear?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]This is just between us. Don't tell anyone else.[%p]
[name]Student[line]On the map, the approximate time axis is displayed horizontally, and of course, the vertical axis displays certain times.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Okay, let's try opening the map.[%p]
[name]Student[line]The vertical axis of the map displays nearly the same time in each parallel world.[%p]
[name]Student[line]So when you want to see a different parallel world at the current time, look at the map vertically.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Pretty cool, right?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.[%p]
[name]Student[line]The timing for when I tell you different information is on the first night before sunset, and the following afternoon, right around now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]So if you speak to me in each parallel world at around this time, I'll probably give you different information.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Student[line]Shh⋯ I'm experiencing the waves of the world right now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]I've got some information to share with you, but it'll take time to explain.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you still want to hear?[%p]
[name]Student[line]Do you want to hear it again?[%p]
Listen
Don't listen
[name]Student[line]I'll tell you, just this once.[%p]
[name]Student[line]There are different versions of me in parallel worlds. I'll tell you when you can get the different hints from me in each world.[%p]
[name]Student[line]You should talk to me before sunset the day after the main story begins. Meaning, uh, right about now.[%p]
[name]Student[line]If you talk to me right about now in each parallel world, the hour before sunset, I'll say something completely different.[%p]
[name]Student[line]And when night falls, I go back to my house. Right now is the best time.[%p]
[name]Student[line]What? You want to know how to tell if it's before sunset in each parallel world?[%p]
[name]Student[line]I'll give you that answer tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Student[line]Really⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the hall leading to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need to go to the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Off to the second floor![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm going outside![%p]
