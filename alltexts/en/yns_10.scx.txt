[name]Takuya[line]It feels kind of cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why I have such a bad feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It's the middle of the day, but it's a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the breeze coming in off the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How kind of her to leave the moment she saw me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I get it. She's avoiding me, right? Damn it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it seems like she visits the ocean a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna and the sea. It suits her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was planning to go there after that phone call from Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is, I'm on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It's the middle of the day, but it's a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the breeze coming in off the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Mitsuki isn't on the roof. Of course.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* It's the middle of the day, but it's a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's the breeze coming in off the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Why did I come to the roof?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same rooftop as always. There's nobody around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that Kanna?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Are remedial classes over?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like she's always here.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why do I feel nervous just looking at her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not like I like her all that much.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is this feeling?)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Did you need something?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing on the roof?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I was taking a little break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, did the remedial classes make you tired?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Sorry, I have to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like she's avoiding me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does she hate me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Voice[line]I saw you, Boss Man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That voice is killing me.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You are so terrible! You troublemaker![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I climbed up to the rooftop.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hello, Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That was scary.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she out on the roof all alone?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I climbed up to the roof, but no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it up to the rooftop⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's Ms. Eriko there by the handrail.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's time for a smoke break, like always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eeeriiiikooo![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Aahh![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, it's you. *sigh* You almost made me burn myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you put out your cigarette so fast?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If the guidance counselor catches me doing this, I'll never hear the end of it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe she's actually a teacher.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yet you still have the cigarette in your mouth.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's fine if it's just you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know how to feel about that. Flattered? Insulted?)[%p]
