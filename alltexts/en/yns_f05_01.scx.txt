[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not even 10pm yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear the voices of club students inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]School at night is meant for ghost stories.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the school gate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I still see some students around though. Staying for club activities, maybe?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I gonna do, climb up there and pretend to be a cicada?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll say this: I don't like the plan.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a utility pole. It holds those electric cables in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why am I explaining things like a dictionary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't see it from here, but I don't need to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The top one says 「Stop」 and the bottom one says 「No Parking.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's any space in the streets of Japan, these signs spring up like bamboo shoots.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's also true that looking at green makes you feel calm and relaxed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All these plants are here almost apologetically.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, they're not hurting anything so whatever, but I just don't like it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's pretty bad to destroy nature only to turn around and say 「we love nature.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you break it, you pay for it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guardrail is tough enough to take a hit from a car.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course our tax dollars paid for it, so if anyone were to break it, they'd have to pay to fix it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I also pay consumer taxes, so that makes this partly mine⋯maybe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is always taking a walk over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what kind of person lives here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A traditional Japanese house with lots of nature around it. What a place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, Yuuki mentioned something about a curse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No sparrows in sight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sparrows like to rest up there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're stretched all around like spider webs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hot during the day, cold at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This asphalt is just like sand in the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really hot. I bet heat waves will come off it soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The temperature of asphalt rises above 120 degrees at the peak of summer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet I'll be seeing mirages.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the wall surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's surrounding the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This school isn't very tall, but it's on a large property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd take a while to walk all the way around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard this type of construction is called an intelligent building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The interior design is actually pretty nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is Sakaimachi Academy, the school I attend.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A safe name for a university, I guess⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing, staring up at the sky like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is the sky, no matter where you go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not many people around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, so I should have assumed that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's night, so I should have assumed that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, let's go back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll go back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'll try going back to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think Ayumi is around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline. I'll try going there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I can check it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sea at night. It must be so quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, now I really want to see the ocean.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll try going to the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock is open. That means I can go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The lock is activated at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I can't get in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, time to go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The automatic lock is in place, so it looks like I can't get inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, the automatic lock activates after dark.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course it's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't go inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll try going inside.[%p]
