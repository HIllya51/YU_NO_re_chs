[name]Takuya[line]Nobody asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, why was the curtain closed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's strange.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know someone is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where, where are you?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]*sneeze*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What was that?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I just heard a sneeze.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, the only place I can think of is underneath the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what could be underneath⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't this⋯ So-called th-thighs?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quite peachy and soft⋯ No, that's not the point.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there someone underneath the bed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to take a peek underneath.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms⋯ Ms. Eriko?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Mmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like she's asleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I heard some moaning, which gave me ideas.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what is she doing underneath the bed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe she can sleep on the hard floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On the hard floor, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯ Abel⋯ Dell⋯ Midra⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sleep talking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is sweating a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not that hot.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ahhh⋯ Abel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*gasp*)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ahhhhhh⋯ It's hot⋯scorching⋯burning⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Is Ms. Eriko having a nightmare?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's burning⋯ Please don't leave me⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I will make sure⋯that he's⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]No⋯ Don't go⋯ No![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms⋯ Ms. Eriko.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sh-She looks like she's having a bad nightmare.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I'll be sure to capture him and⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I want to go back⋯to those days⋯ Ahh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is Abel? She keeps on repeating it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Perhaps he's a lover who stole Ms. Eriko's heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, she is sweating a lot⋯ I know! I have a handkerchief that Ayumi always puts in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This will do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that falling from her eyes⋯tears?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is she⋯crying?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, when I look at her closely⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯she's quite beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]M-My heart's starting to pound.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Ahhh⋯ Abel, you came back to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Please, come closer to me⋯come.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Wait⋯ What? Are you okay, Ms. Eriko?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Eriko[line]Uh⋯ Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know Ms. Eriko is sleeping but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She kissed me, out of the blue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko seems to be emotionally overwrought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess she thought I was Abel, whoever that is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯it was nice. Soft lips.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, she's awake.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Huh⋯what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you doing there?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh⋯ Abel?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she is still sleeping.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, y-you⋯ What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's my line. Ms. Eriko, you're sleeping on the hard floor.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sleeping?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Eek!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eek?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]G-Get out. Get out![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Ow, ow, don't hit me like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You crept into my bed. That's inexcusable![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ow, ow⋯ Okay, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch. What's the matter with her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She didn't have to hit me like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, maybe I shouldn't have just sat around watching her⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I really hear Ms. Eriko scream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's kind of surprising that she's so, you know, cute.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What the heck are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Didn't I tell you that's my line?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I happened to walk into the school infirmary, and⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Did you see my sleeping face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I did.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, no![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Only my lifetime companion gets to see my sleeping face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Companion? What's that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Although it was unexpected, I have deviated from my own moral guidelines.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Why are you mad? What did I do?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I know what you did![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Well, it was only a kiss.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What? You kissed me too?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, Ms. Eriko. You kissed me first.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Hmm⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you said 「Abel」 and⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know if that's your ex-boyfriend or what, but you were having a nightmare.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]But, you saw my sleeping face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't understand her at all.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sheesh⋯sorry to panic.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's all right. But why were you sleeping on the hard floor?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Because it feels nice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Beds are not suitable for me. It's more comfortable there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you were having a nightmare.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, that's nothing. It's a long time ago. It's about the past, and I don't even want to remember.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And you⋯ What do you need at this time of the day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I forgot something in the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Then, go pick it up quickly. I have something to think about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I think Ms. Eriko is feeling a bit blue.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Maybe because of that dream?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it doesn't seem like the right time to ask.)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Well, sorry about hitting you. I got things confused with my dream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No worries, I don't mind since I got to see your cute side.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she blushing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then. I'm leaving.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you don't leave soon, I'm going to activate the electronic lock at the entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See you around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She really is strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sleeping on the hard floor⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And something about seeing her sleeping face? What was that all about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is Abel anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it the person who was wearing this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Take a lick, just a little bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding. If I do something like that, I will be a real weirdo.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I wanted to lick those panties. *lick*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop, it's weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Panties have nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh no, looking at it makes me dizzy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's not look at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I feel like it's still warm⋯*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, hold on⋯ What am I trying to sniff?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what a pervert would do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sheesh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't this women's underwear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I picked it up and wanted to take a sniff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But the question is, why are these panties lying here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a glove.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe someone's inside? Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Long gloves that cover over the elbows.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a glove, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a long glove that covers the elbow⋯like that ones you see at parties.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why is this on the bed in the school infirmary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My heart is intrigued, but this is not it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A garter belt, to hold your stockings in place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what I think it is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's some lady's underwear that keeps stockings from falling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are also stockings placed in front of them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stockings. It makes me want to wear them on my head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not what I'm here for.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stockings⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not something you wear on your head.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet these are stockings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And it's the kind you hook up to a garter belt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is the one on top a garter belt?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if the person who wears these clothes is around⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a dress with very little fabric⋯ I don't know who wears this though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a very tight dress⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]However, it seems to be different from what Ms. Eriko always wears.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who's clothes these are⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the bar?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's not a thread worm, she won't be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you hit your head on this, you'll be able to sleep soundly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't want to try that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a bar for the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I used to fall on the bed and bump my head on this all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why I slept so good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think the pillow has anything to do with it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Leave the pillow alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have other problems to solve.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a pillow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me tell you a joke. 「There's a pill on the pillow.」 「Ow.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe in the bed? No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she is in here, she must be as flat as a pancake.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think students are sleeping here around this time of the day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I don't think Ms. Eriko would be sleeping either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an ordinary bed placed in school infirmaries.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The problem is this mess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Curtains closed for no one sleeping, underwear and clothes left behind⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing is going to be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wheels, for moving the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wheels to move the bed around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No reason for you to roll it around now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's in the next bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means, it's on this side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It serves as a 「divider」 to the next bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just to let you know, nobody's in the next bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The curtain was closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means, someone is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the curtain that I opened.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When I came in to school infirmary, this one was closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why was it closed?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure someone is here. Where are they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't look like anyone's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no time for that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't the time to use items.[%p]
