When Triangle Mountain crumbled, it made a huge commotion.[%p]
The Sakaimachi city council was in a panic about losing an important cultural monument.[%p]
Apparently, there was a disagreement between Geo Technics and the city. Some believed the company's geological survey was to blame.[%p]
Mio and I are the only ones who know the truth.[%p]
A few years later⋯[%p]
Mio is on the doctorate path at a university. I'm majoring in history.[%p]
Basically, I'm her assistant.[%p]
Her fanaticism for history has gotten worse⋯[%p]
Of course, given what she saw in that underground cavern, even a normal academic would go wild with joy.[%p]
Mio is studying so she can one day unravel the secrets of Triangle Mountain. I guess that's the power of being a fanatic.[%p]
Now, Mio and I live together in a condo in Sakaimachi.[%p]
Mio pays the mortgage. She told me to leave it to her and bought it herself.[%p]
I think she's trying to turn me into a trophy husband⋯ Geez.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You say that, but who's the one who doesn't share their paycheck?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That would be me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not trying to get into it about money, but I'd at least like you to show me you care.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll show you I care anytime. Like this.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mmm⋯ Money can't buy you love.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're being illogical.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Just listen to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do. I hear your voice every night.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was so exciting the first time, back in the cave.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-Why are you bringing up ancient history?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what did you want to talk about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Right, in the laboratory yesterday⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I haven't told anyone in the lab that you and I live together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You haven't?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But the other day in the lab⋯ I think one of the assistants saw us kissing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I remember. You wanted it bad all of the sudden, so even though we were in the laboratory⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hey, this is what I mean about getting your facts straight. You're the one that wanted to do it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even so, you didn't seem to mind.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Still⋯ That is the first time I've ever been in that situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you'd never done that before?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You were my first, Takuya. I've been only yours ever since then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I guess I still have a lot to teach you then.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A-A lot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like⋯*whisper whisper*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh, you do that⋯there?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, we'll try it out next time.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll take your silence as a yes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]A-Anyway, back to the subject.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please, tell me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So the other day, that pervert assistant who was spying on us came on to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me guess: I'm the pervert assistant.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're the super pervert assistant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Anyway, I told him I was already in love with a super pervert, who is resourceful and amazing in bed, so he should leave me alone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So who is this super-perverted, resourceful man?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]The person bathing with me right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯ So what did he say?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]He cried and gave up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah ha ha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]*sigh* It's going to happen soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Your period?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You idiot! The excavation will soon start at Triangle Mountain⋯well, at the place where it used to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, this is why everyone in the laboratory makes fun of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I go at my own pace. I don't care what they think.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]On the other hand, you say clever things that make the professors admire you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Really?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I guess you're more about inspiration than you are about reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you saying I'm like an animal?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're not an animal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll show you an animal.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you saying? Don't be stupid![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm an animal, so I don't care if we're in the bath. Raawwrr.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh⋯ You really are a super pervert. Hehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Takuya⋯ I love you. I'll never let you go.[%p]
Solving the mystery of Triangle Mountain with Mio⋯ That's my life's work now.[%p]
She's a little stubborn, but she listens to me, and she's smart.[%p]
Mio and I will continue on, hand in hand, living together.[%p]
This is one life I can live happily⋯[%p]
