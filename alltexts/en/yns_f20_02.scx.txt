[name]Kaori[line]You brought me a blue card, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't say you don't have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Blue card⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a card to enter restricted areas in Geo Technics.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me with a very slight grin.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's so modern.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her face is cute, but I think she might be older than me.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay. Thank you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I thought we could work together.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Goodbye, Takuya. I won't see you anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is that really okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't break the law no matter what the reason is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi will understand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! No more errands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should head back downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The city's as lively as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Can't you give it to me?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'll wait one more time.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Give me the blue card.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You don't know what to do, do you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I know how you feel. It's good for you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Give me the blue card.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't tell me you don't have it after you came all the way here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so shiny it looks like it might twinkle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her mid-length hair is beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's light illuminating it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Although I'm very curious to see what's going on inside.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should already know the answer to that question.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoops.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Use common sense. I can't do that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, you want to see, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, what a nice breeze. *peek*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, hehe. You're very forward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just kidding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're very direct, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, being so straightforward is good once in a while I guess.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa. That's a pretty bold outfit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't keep myself from staring.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you looking at?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Sorry, but I can't give you this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I never said I wanted it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess she likes shiny stuff.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Fashionable clothes and shiny jewelry. A very mature combination.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Doesn't she get cold with her stomach exposed that much?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No use worrying about that, I suppose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'd love to rub my cheeks against and lick that beautiful navel of hers.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Psh. Not even in my dreams.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you laughing about all of a sudden? You're so strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not sure why, but I get the feeling she's being provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's that kind of pose.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hands are so provocative.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are provocative hands, anyway?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's beautiful, but I don't know if I can trust her.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heh heh. This is exactly what I wanted.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Last night, I couldn't get past the second security check.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I got a normal security card with no problem, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Was it really okay to hand over that blue card?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I-I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're wondering if it's okay to do this, aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now that you've given this to me, you're complicit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's too late now. I'm sure you had plenty of time to think it over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]By the time you came here and handed me that card, you'd already made your decision. What do you say?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're my partner now. Aren't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's my⋯partner?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's right. I did have plenty of time to think it over.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And I came here to cooperate with Kaori.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is Kaori planning to do? And what is Ayumi doing at the company?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now I can find out.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And that's what I want to know.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm only cooperating with Kaori temporarily.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's not a friend or family.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've got nothing tying me to her. I should watch my step.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]*smirk* Look at the expression on your face now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I've prepared myself for the worst.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. Good. That's good. You look great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I-I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori, we don't have time for this.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Wow, you're unexpectedly calm. A nice woman is asking for your attention.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? A nice woman? Where?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Excuse you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heh heh. We're partners from here on out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Partners⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]And now, we're going to buck the law and uncover the mystery at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]We should get to know each other better! I can't get any work done unless I put my life in my partner's hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's too much.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is it too much? Can you really trust a complete stranger?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I can't. So I get physical to learn everything about my partner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
Kaori Asakura is a strange woman.[%p]
She's a beautiful woman in her mid-twenties, and she's got a figure like a runway model.[%p]
You wouldn't expect her to be a newscaster on tv.[%p]
The program's already got a high viewership, and Kaori Asakura seems to be star of the show.[%p]
It's starting to feel like it's just a facade though. I can already tell she's not really like that.[%p]
My instincts tell me I shouldn't be fooled by appearances. I need to keep a firm grasp on reality.[%p]
Her job, her title, her smile, her laugh⋯ It's all fake. It's all for show.[%p]
It's kind of unbelievable that she's even with me right now. It's like something straight out of a movie.[%p]
But I came here to meet Kaori Asakura.[%p]
(I had plenty of time to think it over.)[%p]
I'm here to cooperate with Kaori.[%p]
What is Kaori planning to do? And what is Ayumi doing at the company?[%p]
Now I can find out.[%p]
And that's what I want to know.[%p]
I'm only cooperating with Kaori temporarily.[%p]
She's not a friend or family.[%p]
⋯[%p]
She said she likes to get physical to get to know her partner.[%p]
But she just wants to use me. That's all.[%p]
I'll allow myself to be used by her.[%p]
Plus, she says I've got merit. I might find out everything about Geo Technics through her⋯[%p]
No, that's not it. I want to know about Ayumi and my father.[%p]
If I stay with Kaori Asakura, I might learn something, and that's enough to keep me interested.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Don't judge a book by its cover, Takuya. You were wild and intense, but somehow gentle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't need to say that.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But it's true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were amazing, too. You always look so elegant.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, don't say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehehe.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's a regular security card.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're well prepared. But I have that one.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What I want is the blue card. You know that, don't you?[%p]
