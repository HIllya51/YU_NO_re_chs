[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, what are you staring at me for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tell me something.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]No, none of that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that. It's about Toyotomi. What's gonna happen to him?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Toyotomi? Who knows?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, 「who knows」?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It was his job to bring those documents. Now that there's no need to bring them, he's no longer needed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man, that's cold.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you feel bad for him, you could always go meet up with him.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe, that's what I mean. Right about now he should be on the phone with a client, getting fired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is something wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It seems like something happened between you two. What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, something happened.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Come on, tell your big sister what's wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He argued me down because I don't have enough evidence. Can't win against his logic, I guess.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]He always says things like, 「Where's your evidence?」 Oh, right! That's why I was looking for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hold on a second. I have something in my bag.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's crawling on the floor over to her bag on the side table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can see her panties clear as day.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Sorry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's nothing⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Where was it now? Oh, I think it was in my pocket.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is she doing?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, when did you take that from me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Look, you're holding it. The picture of Toyotomi's secret meeting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, you're right.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're very nimble-fingered, aren't you? Oh well. You remember when I took this picture of him, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You never know where or when a picture like that could come in handy. I don't spare any effort for things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a picture of Toyotomi meeting with some yakuza.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His face is there, clear as day. Irrefutable evidence.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why are you looking so pale? You can have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just sit around here. Sorry Kaori![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, here it is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. You remember when I took this picture of him, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯yes.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You never know where or when a picture like that could come in handy. I don't spare any effort for things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a picture of Toyotomi meeting with some yakuza.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His face is there, clear as day. Irrefutable evidence.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong? Why are you looking so pale?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kaori![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ahh! What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you give me this picture? Well, I just need to borrow it actually.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, I was planning on giving it to you. That's why I was looking for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
You obtained [color index="840000"][Secret Meeting Photo][color index="800000"].
You obtained [color index="840000"][Secret Meeting Photo][color index="800000"].
[name]Takuya[line]I can't just sit around here. Sorry Kaori![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]H-Hey, you're just going to leave me here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, and thanks![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ugh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now that I have this, Toyotomi won't have much to say.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know he'll say this is some kind of fabricated photo.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But if Ayumi sees this, she'll finally understand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to hurry home!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi!!!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You!!! I've been looking for you![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Explain yourself right now![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you babbling about?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I just got a call from my client.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About being fired?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]What?! So this really was your doing![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know anything. You should start by questioning yourself.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why does the client have the 20th document page?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Grr. How could this happen all of a sudden?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Dammit, my excellent brains and ability to take action would have come in handy for the new world.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My condolences. I don't feel bad for you though.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ugh, this⋯ It's all your fault![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't it your mistake? Don't blame this on me.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]She's no longer needed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? What did you do?![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Nothing. I'm just being honest. She's just a tool.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I gave that frustrated widow the satisfaction she needed. There's no need to be angry with me. In fact, you should be thanking me.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Ahhh! M-My nose! You broke my nose![%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's assault! That was no accident![auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Toyotomi[line]*clutch*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe she likes that stupid bastard.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't believe it!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi. Ayumi!!!)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You remind me of your father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, did you⋯with the old bastard?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Only once⋯ Don't get angry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You really did?! With that old bastard?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, but only once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Unbelievable! I never expected that of someone like you, Kaori.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Why are you taking that tone? I was just curious about the difference between you and your father⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just curious? Geez![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What can I say? I finished a job and I'm in a good mood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Job?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it the one with that paper?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You could say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you had page 20 of that document, it would be complete.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let's not talk about that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is up with that document?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Your mother knows about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She won't tell me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I see. Okay. I'll tell you, just this once. Don't tell anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's the formula to generate a liquid that preserves ore in its natural state.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It preserves ore?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yup. When ore is dug into the ground as is, its physical properties can change dramatically. It might be to help prevent upsetting the ore's property.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The liquid could be used to maintain the ore's natural state.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's right. That's your mother's work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's Ayumi's?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes. She knows something, but⋯ Well, this is just a hobby of mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What use does that liquid have?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's intended to maintain the natural state of the ore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there any way ore can change states as soon as it's dug up?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, that's exactly what the Hypersense Stone does.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hyper what?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You don't need to know. Let's not talk about it–I don't like talking about work in bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Can you tell me about your father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Yes, about Dr. Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I don't know why, but every time I mention your father, you get that look on your face.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What look?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Like there's something stuck in your teeth that you can't get.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't know what she's talking about⋯)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's with the face?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you're asking about my bastard of a father.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What was he like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haven't you met him before? You told me you interviewed him.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]A few times, yeah, but I don't think I've ever met the real man, ya know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I was wondering what he was like at home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He always acted the same way.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you want me to say?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whatever you wish to say.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He was tough: he was a skeptic, a free thinker. Sometimes, he seemed like he wasn't thinking, but he could also be extremely smart, wonderful, and a funny guy.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]That's great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not great. He liked women, and he wasn't strict. So I got to do whatever I wanted.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The best way to describe him is as a poor man who abandoned his educational duties. A real bastard.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]But you grew up so well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Children grow up and learn to recognize their parents' flaws as bad examples.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You don't know anything.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heh. You wouldn't know it from looking at me, but I used to run child care programs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a newscaster. If your fans across the country knew, they'd be shocked.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're an idiot. My popularity is skyrocketing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should consider yourself a lucky man for having been with such a beautiful newscaster as myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't pinch me.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I was interested in you, so I talked to you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're interested in me? Why?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I have my reasons.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are you trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]This wasn't your first time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, obviously not![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I want to claim at least one guy's virginity.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It clearly wasn't your first time, but you're not exactly experienced either. The balance between the two was⋯exquisite.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It was good, because you're inexperienced.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Whoa, you're blushing. Heh. It makes me want to hug you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]It's too late to be a bad boy. Heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is getting hard.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What's wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kaori is looking at me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's lying right next to me.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm fascinated with you.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You're nice.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'd like it if you stroked my hair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Aren't you curious about it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, I mean⋯ It's beautiful.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Ha! Thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is so silky. I can practically hear it shimmering in the light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a bit long.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey, my eyes are up here.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]By the way, you were too rough earlier.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I like it, but not all women do. Okay?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should be gentle with women.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Let's rest for a while. Okay?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hey⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What are you trying to do?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You should put it on your waist⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If I don't, I'll get anxious.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Is that funny?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such beautiful, soft skin.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you looking at my skin?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You have such unexpectedly fair skin.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]What do you mean unexpectedly? I don't go to tanning salons. I'm proud of my natural tone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has such beautiful, soft skin.)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I really like this room.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you curious about this room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How much does it cost a day?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, multiply your pocket money by three, add 500 dollars, and you'd be close.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with that, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is a room in the hotel downtown.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess Kaori lives here now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just think about it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I going to use here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not a good time to do that.)[%p]
