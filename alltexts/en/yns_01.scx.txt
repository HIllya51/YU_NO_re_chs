[name]Takuya[line]I accidentally came back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the phone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be at this hour⋯? I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm all alone in this empty house⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I'm not the type to feel all sad about it. Now, what should I do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I came back to my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯ Why did I come back here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm pretty sure I should be heading to the mansion right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A call⋯ I wonder who it could be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Obviously, Mitsuki isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, why did I return to my room⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do I really want to go back to school?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no sign of that old bastard, is there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's alive somewhere. I can feel it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder where.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, can I come in?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯ Come in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi. Good, you're dressed.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hey! Don't say things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]There was a phone call from Ms. Ichijou.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Ichijou⋯(Mitsuki.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]She seemed to be in a hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A hurry? (I wonder why.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I called you, but you didn't answer me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I was, uh⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]You were⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I⋯ Umm⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Is this something you can't tell me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯ Look, all boys do it, okay?![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]All boys?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just really awkward if your parents catch you. When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I⋯ You know⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She looks almost as uncomfortable as I am.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she was the one walking around naked at night. This isn't nearly as bad as that!)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ahem. So, Mitsuki⋯ I mean, what about Ms. Ichijou?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Um⋯ She said she would talk to you at school tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It must be about Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She might be worried.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she said it was urgent. I wonder what she wanted.)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll try to call her from here. Thanks, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Sure. Goodnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What does Mitsuki think is so urgent?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just need to call her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use the first floor to get outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't use the first floor to get outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi is pretty strict about things like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should I do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no idea where the old bastard is hiding⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All I've got is this weird device.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Assuming it is a clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what could it possibly lead to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to gather my thoughts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Things are happening so fast.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should think about Ayumi first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder who's calling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to read my father's letter one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I might understand why Ayumi's acting the way she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I'm back in the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew! I'm back in the room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did I come back here? I need to find Ayumi at school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I'll just go to bed tonight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll continue this tomorrow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's the best way to do it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Goodnight⋯
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's all that noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shut up! I'm tired![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, sir![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The phone! Ayumi?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to relax.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I need to calm down and get a grip on the situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's letter led me to the Shrine at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's strange, but it fits.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I had expected to see my father there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I saw something else instead.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was a strange woman who wanted to tell me something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what she wanted to say⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what did she have to do with my father?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father said something about the flow of time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should read the letter.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, that's right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「The flow of time is not an irreversible phenomenon. You must understand that it is a reversible concept.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Alone, this device can create enough energy to reverse approximately twelve hours. The main unit is separate.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does reverse mean you can turn back time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't some sci-fi movie.
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was also that naked woman who died and then disappeared right in front of me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Man, that alone was out of the norm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And I saw it with my own eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just wait for Ayumi for now. When she gets back, I'll talk to her and decide how to handle this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if she doesn't come back⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she doesn't come back by tomorrow morning, I'll go to the police.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all I can think to do now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
