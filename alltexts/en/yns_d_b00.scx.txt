[name]Yuuki[line]It's still blocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-The entrance⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Aaah⋯ Awawawaaa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's blocked, isn't it?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Y-Yes! It's blocked![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Wh-What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
Guuhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hrrnn⋯ Arrggh⋯ Come on![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no good. It won't budge.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]L-Let's try together.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay. Let's do this.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Yeah.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One, two, three![%p]
Gaaah⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Hrrnnn⋯[%p]
*pfft*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]S-Sorry. Eating that hamburger before we came in here was not a good idea.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You've got some nerves⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Sorry. What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How am I supposed to know?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing we can do. This can't be moved by human strength.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Maybe Miss Mio got stopped by this, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I think you're onto something. Maybe she just wanted to take a look inside⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]And then, bam, the entrance closed behind her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why her bag was left outside. She didn't have time to go back and get it.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Do you think⋯she's okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯ Maybe she's using her history fanati-power to get out of this situation somehow.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]F-Fanati-power?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her power as a fanatic. She can be pretty powerful in weird situations.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]You know her well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Oh, I don't mind. I'm totally over it now. *sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No you're not.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]But⋯ It's okay if it's you, Boss Man. Please, take care of Miss Mio.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would you say that? Man, do you understand our situation at all?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uh, we're currently stuck inside here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What should we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Aren't you scared?[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Well, the only thing I'm afraid of is Miss Mio when she's mad.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Why are you frowning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* But I guess this has it's own merits.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's better than him screaming and crying⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]What do we do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder what we should do⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wish I could ask someone for help⋯)[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Umm⋯ I feel like we're going back and forth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel the same way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The entrance is right in front of us. We can get outside through there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But when I want to go back, I should use 「Move」 on the edge of the screen.[%p]
[name]Yuuki[line]Uhm, I don't know what you're saying.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry about it.[%p]
