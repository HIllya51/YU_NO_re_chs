[name]Takuya[line](Ugh, my head hurts⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This place–)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Agh⋯ I fell pretty hard.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Look at all these books⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could this place be Ryuuzouji's storehouse?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This place is so serene⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*glub*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*glub glub glub*![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*glub glub glub, glub glub*![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*glub glub, glub glub glub glub, glub glub glub*![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pwaaah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Haah⋯haah⋯ I thought⋯ I thought I was a goner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I dove into the water⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why is it warm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯warm water?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so cramped in here! Th-This place is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯a bathroom![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck am I doing here⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ I need to get out of here.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Ah!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?!
[name]Takuya[line]A-A-Ayu⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A p-pervert?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, c-calm down! It's just me![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]「Me」? Who's 「me」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* (That's right, she's not wearing her glasses⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I forgot how extremely near-sighted Ayumi is.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what am I doing here anyways?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Are you here to take my virginity?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]N-No, I'm not going to do that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to focus on getting out of here!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch⋯ Where exactly am I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, this place⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I might have seen it before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this⋯ Ayumi's office?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing here–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Whoa?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Who are you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A human.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯How did you get in here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯From the sky.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, to be completely honest, I'm not really sure either.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Did you see?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]See⋯what?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Isn't it obvious? My afternoon love affair with Director Arima in the other room![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯What?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hah⋯ You look so disappointed not seeing your stepmother's naked body.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This little⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't know what you're doing here, but you need to leave, now. Or do you prefer I call security?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Go ahead. You'll be the one in trouble here, not me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's going on⋯?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Why hello, Director.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]T-Takuya⋯ What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Trespassing, it seems.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Is that true, Takuya?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, there's something I've been wanting to tell you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This guy⋯ Toyotomi can't be trusted.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What do you mean by that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Last night, he–[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hold it. Keep talking if you must, but I'll be sure to have my say, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Your words will rain a great deal of trouble down on not only yourself, but on her as well. Even you should be able to see that, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What⋯are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-That's⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Just some senseless rambling. Nothing to concern yourself with.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You're not a child anymore. It's time you learned a little something about prudence like a mature adult, hm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Stop! Takuya, please don't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What's the matter? You appear out of nowhere and suddenly start antagonizing Tomita⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But he–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi, listen. Last night, this asshole–[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please⋯don't make me hate you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Let's talk some more later tonight, okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And what about you, huh?! I thought you had an important meeting to go to?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why did you have to take in a guy like him? Damn it⋯![%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Ah⋯ Takuya, wait![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She didn't even try to hear what I had to say!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Instead, she sided with an asshole like him⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I must look like a complete idiot⋯ Son of a bitch!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oww⋯ What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, isn't this⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Mio's room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, I must have been inside the closet to the right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, what was I doing inside a closet?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And what's with all that noise?[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh–at⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What are you doing here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This should be Mio's room, so why are you here, Mio?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯Are you feeling okay, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gimme a minute⋯ I need to figure out what's going on.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha–?![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh my gosh, my closet is a mess![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I can't believe you opened up a girl's closet, you jerk![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't open it, I just went inside.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, why are you always like this? I'll have to clean this up later⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I resent that⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You'd better not be hiding any of my underwear.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wha⋯ Why would I want any of 「your」 underwear?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Now what's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I didn't mean it like that![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「What」 yourself. And what's with that pile of documents by your feet?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What do you mean⋯? You said you wanted to know more about Sword Cape, so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]D-Did I?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You did![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]R-Right. So then, I came here to learn more about Sword Cape from you⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you saying⋯? Are you all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I⋯think so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I see⋯ Then I really did come here to talk with Mio about this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew⋯ Right. That must be why.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]All right, take a look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey hey, you're making a mess on the floor⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But these won't all fit on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Here, look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is impressive.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I know. It was hard work finding and collecting all of these.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is really in-depth⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm surprised she gathered so many documents⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? This place⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Whaaaaa?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You⋯ Houjou, was it?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]A-Am I going crazy? I-I thought I just saw you come down from the sky⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You must be imagining things. I don't have any wings or a ring over my head.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh⋯ I guess I just had too much to drink last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I must be in front of Kanna's room.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If Houjou is here, that must mean⋯)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hey, how are you feeling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Great, until I saw you.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh. You've got a mouth, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Kanna Hatano isn't here right now, it seems.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's good. I'm sure she would hate it if you just showed up to see her.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I have a feeling you don't like me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me clear the air then: 「I don't like you.」[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh⋯ Cool down there, big guy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I just wanted to talk. I've been looking for you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with this guy⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯the school hall?[%p]
[name]Students[line]*whisper*[%p]
[name]Student[line]I-I know what I saw! Someone just came tumbling out of the sky![%p]
[name]Student[line]What, daydreaming already?[%p]
[name]Student[line]No, really–I'm not lying![%p]
[name]Student[line]Okay, okay⋯ I'll pay for today's lunch. Let's go.[%p]
[name]Student[line]But⋯ I really am telling the truth⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like I'm inside the school hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is happening to me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ugh⋯ My head is throbbing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess I'm in the school hall, and it seems like it's still daytime.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's obviously still daytime, but I wonder what day it is exactly⋯[%p]
