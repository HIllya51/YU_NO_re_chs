[name]Takuya[line]It's like some kind of⋯mine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't sound like that ruckus is coming from the tower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We should get closer instead of watching from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We'll be able to see better that way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The tower is black and really tall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Running around over there⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I see something⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's someone running toward the desert![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's almost like they're running away from here![%p]
[name]Worker[line]They actually are running away, ya idiot.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Fools. There's no way they'll escape.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]How awful⋯ I'd end up the same if I tried to escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're running for the desert, but no one's going after them.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Of course they won't. There's no need.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* No way we can help them now. They've gone too far.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is everyone talking about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's too late to⋯help them?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell![%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's over.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]May they rest in peace.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that rumbling? Sounds like thunder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why would there be thunder on such a clear day?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Th-They're gone⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did that person just die from a bolt of lightning?![%p]
[name]Worker[line]It happens all the time. Get back to work.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I need to take this load way over there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with those guys?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A person just⋯died! What's going on?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They're here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who're they?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]You, get to work! Hurry up![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who's here? What's going on?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Eeek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?![%p]
[name]Voice[line]Heh, heh⋯ So, you're the new guy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's with this person?)[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]I feel like we haven't met before⋯ Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]So, you're the one who broke into the temple and got captured by the Royal Guard? That's a nice face you're making.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you?[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]What? Haven't you heard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. I don't know any fatties.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Here's an introduction for ya⋯ Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Gaah!!![%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]How's that for a hello, heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ He whipped me bad. That bastard!)[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Hm, you've got different eyes from the rest of them. I'm looking forward to seeing more of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who the hell are you?[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Oh, where are my manners? Heh, heh⋯ I'm the warden of this mine and the prison.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mine⋯and the prison?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You'll be worked to death here, no doubt about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Lots of people in Dela Grante try to rebel against the God-Monarch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]This is a work camp for those stupid enough to get caught.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A work camp⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]There are several other camps just like this, which goes to show how many people with bad intentions are out there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I'd advise against trying to escape. You saw what just happened, didn't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, did you do that?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]It wasn't me, but the Tower of Garzel⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tower of Garzel⋯?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Yes, it serves a very nice purpose for those thinking more devious thoughts. Heh, heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Today, you'll be mining for something very important.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What would that be?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You'll be lookin' for sacred stones⋯ Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh, never heard about it? I'll have to give those guys a stern talkin' to.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What stones are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I'm sure you must've heard all about it. The sacred stones are a necessary component for the priestess's ritual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The priestess's⋯ritual?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I need you to understand that the work we're doing here is a holy undertaking. Heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The sacred stones⋯are necessary for a ritual? Not only that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](By priestess, does he mean⋯?)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Rumors say the priestess was duped by some nefarious fellow and she didn't fulfill her duty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Well, worrying about it won't do anything for us⋯ All we have to do is follow the orders of the God-Monarch. Heh, heh, heh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The God-Monarch, you say?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Once you realize this holy endeavor is meant to save Dela Grante, maybe you'll put a little more power into your work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think an ogre can motivate me.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Oh good, very good. Heh, heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where's Yu-No?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Yu-No? Who's that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The young woman I was with.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I haven't the slightest idea. You were alone when you were brought here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yu-No isn't here⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]You know, I really love young men with intense eyes like that. Heh, heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that supposed to mean?[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]I adore seeing those bright eyes lose their vigor and intensity as time goes on, until they become as dead and lifeless as a shark's.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're a fucking sadist.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Let's bet on how long the intensity in those eyes of yours will last. Hmm, let's see⋯ I'll give it one month.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think they'll stay this way until the moment I kill you.[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Good, very good. Heh, heh, heh. I'll be waiting for the day when you're begging me for your life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt*[%p]
[name]Vile Chief[line]Now, you can ask the others about the details of the work. Heh, heh, heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn it⋯ He hit me in the face. I can taste my own blood.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That fat piece of shit⋯*spit*[%p]
[name]Worker[line]You're incredible.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I've never seen anyone go against the warden like that![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do you all just do whatever he says?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Can't help it. Your life is over once you're sent here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's tough following orders and working all day, but they give us food and a place to sleep.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's all you need, huh?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]No use complaining. Besides, someone's gotta find them sacred stones.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]For the priestess's ritual⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Well, better get to work. I'll show you where you can sleep once the sun goes down. See you around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone is working silently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They look exhausted, their eyes lacking any life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're all slaves to that fat warden⋯ Dammit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll get out of here. I'll show them all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I left Yu-No at the temple⋯
[name]Yu-No[line]((Daaaaaad!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yu-No?!))[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]((Dad, please don't die!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Yu-No, I'll be right there!))[%p]
[name]Yu-No[line]((Daaaaaad!!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like I'm going to die before rescuing Yu-No. Yeah, right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't care what this fat-ass warden does.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll wait for my chance. It'll come eventually.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But not now. Not while that lightning-shooting tower is around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as that thing is here, I can't run away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn. How does that thing work though?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It creates lightning that strikes anyone who tries to escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll just work here and wait to escape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My time will come. I'll get my chance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯ Wait for me, please.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I will save you, I promise.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A mine⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at a mine right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's all the commotion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone's chattering. What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This looks like some kind of work camp.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And that tower right there⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I just noticed something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Beyond us, there's a tower⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What could it be? I wonder⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see people all around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're all holding pickaxes and shovels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like they're mining something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is this place?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Rocks, sand, buildings⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯ What is this place?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone's chattering. What happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like everyone's looking toward the desert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone is working silently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What're these sacred stones the warden mentioned?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are they all working so hard?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They dig through the ground and carry out the dirt.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sacred stones⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stones emit a pale light, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, that's what's buried underground here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Digging and moving dirt⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Everyone is working silently.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I should talk to them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like they're digging underground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They break apart the bedrock with pickaxes and carry away the dirt with shovels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're taking the dirt somewhere⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But there's nowhere to go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't even know where I am![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So where⋯where could I be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have no clue.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a minute. Why is everyone making so much commotion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should try taking a closer look.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a tall tower.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is so bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Small towers are surrounding the giant one in the middle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are they used for, I wonder?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What exactly am I looking at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I've seen something similar before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It was a long time ago, at least a few years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A few years ago⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A few years ago, I was still⋯[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((Ahhhh! I can't take it anymore!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]((I can't stand this place!!!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, the work camp is getting really loud.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go back![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hear people chattering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Look at that idiot trying to run away.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]He's been told countless times, and we all know he's seen what happens.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Poor guy⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This happens all the time. Who cares?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Every month there's at least a few that end up like him.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I'm used to it by now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This is just getting in the way of our work.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What? You don't know about the sacred stones?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah, I get it. You're a little messed up, huh?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]That explains how you ended up in this place.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What are we mining for?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The sacred stones, of course.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Huh? Why are we mining?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Are you a moron?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Get to work. Our quota will go up if you don't do your part.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh, don't go past the tower![%p]
[name]Worker[line]That guy is done for⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]There goes another one! See 'em running?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Fools. There's no way they'll escape.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Who was that?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I don't get why you'd even ask⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hey, don't just stand around. You should be carrying dirt, too.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]If you don't, he's gonna notice.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What? Are the stones in this dirt we're moving?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]There's no way there'd be that many.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They're very precious stones.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Yeah, they're beautiful, and give off a pale light.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Oh, sorry. I'm a little busy right now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Gotta meet this quota by the end of the day⋯[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Can't you see? I'm moving the dirt we've been digging.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Why move it?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Because that's my job.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]What's my job?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I told you. Moving this dirt.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It's been almost a year since I came here.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I know I'll never get out.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Hey, watch out! I have to move this dirt over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is going on here?[%p]
