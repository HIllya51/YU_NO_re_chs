[name]Takuya[line](Ms. Eriko is changing by the bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is she really changing right this second? Geez.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](All right then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm not trying to peek or anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm just worried Ms. Eriko might be having trouble. Maybe she needs a hand.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Yeah, helping other people is admirable.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who am I justifying myself to?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just gently, veeery gently⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know I'm contradicting myself.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Quietly. Quietly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](B-But still⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I am totally smitten. Is this even real?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I mean heck yeah.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't know Ms. Eriko was so pretty⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I mean, she's really pretty⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gulp*[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You'd better not be trying to sneak a peek![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I would n-never⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]You are hopeless.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I suppose I can understand how a boy your age might feel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]After all, it's basic instinct for every human to be interested in reproduction.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I've never heard someone use anthropology to justify being a peeping tom before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's the truth. Humanity would go extinct without that instinct.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So did you check?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]On what?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What did you come here for? You came here to get something of Ms. Hatano's, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I told you it was on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh. Really?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]*sigh* Just a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I don't intend to help you continue the human race or anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Here, take this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When did she give that to you?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It was around noon today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](After we left the park⋯)[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Are you going to look inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I will.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Heehee. I'll be pretty surprised if it's chocolate. I heard that's in this season.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I heard it on TV last night. Thought I'd try it out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha⋯(What the hell?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is my old man's bankbook.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I saw this at Kanna's house.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is that what she wants me to have?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's a bankbook.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What's up with that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my old man's.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, it does say Koudai Arima on it. What does that mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should tell Ms. Eriko.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She already asked me about it at the caf⑮ anyway.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now is as good a time as any to tell her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, you're not doing that on purpose, are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's where the curtain is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does it interest you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if she's still changing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could sneak a peek around that curtain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's somewhere else more interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't move yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't seen Kanna yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't need any items now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not the time to use that.[%p]
