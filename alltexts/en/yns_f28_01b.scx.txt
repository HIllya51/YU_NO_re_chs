[name]Takuya[line](What is that bastard Toyotomi doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, if I turn that way⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh? Someone's there.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who's there?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're staring over here really intently.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I'm wrong.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're looking at Toyotomi. Actually it's more like they're watching him.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're staring over here; they haven't moved a muscle.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wonder who it could be⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll try to get around behind them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Quietly⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If it was a couple, they'd be really getting into it⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's fun about watching three ugly guys?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They must have some reason for watching Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who the hell is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The one looking at Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right behind that person⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I was careful coming here, so I don't think they saw me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If a woman's here, she's got to be some kind of nympho.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And she has a camera⋯ There's no question.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So why is she snooping on Toyotomi talking with those two guys?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looking at that kind of thing wouldn't make you happy at all⋯)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Yes, that performance is exactly what I need⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Heh heh heh. You're just as bad as us, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]There's no reason for you to say that to me.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Hmph, don't act all innocent now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can hear them well from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But this woman⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She has a camera without a flash.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That means it's a high-sensitivity camera. She's no amateur⋯ Is she a professional peeper?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I stepped on a twig!)[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kaori?![%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Shh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck are you doing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Give me a second. Let me take a few more pictures.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Pictures?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is she taking pictures of them?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kaori. What are you doing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Quiet!))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]So⋯do you understand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Toyotomi⋯)[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]But we can't do what we need to without the picture.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Right. If we don't know our target's face, it'll just be indiscriminate violence.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Hmm, I thought I put it in my pocket⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Get your head out of your ass, Toyotomi.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Oh, well. I'll bring it to you later. But the time we planned won't change.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Okay. Call me on my cell then.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Just to double check, you are really sure?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't mind, but I won't be happy if I don't achieve my goal.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Yeah, I got it. I just need to steal those papers.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Once we get what you want, we can do as we please, right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]It will be too public if you go that far.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Hmph, fine.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]We'll take the pay up front.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]You get half now. You'll get the other half if you're successful.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Tsk⋯ Now you have your ducks in a row. Okay.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm counting on you.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]It's a woman, right? We can't mess that up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're talking about taking something⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The fact that they're using language like that means⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're not talking about something decent.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((What are you doing?))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Can't you tell?))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((I'm asking why you have that camera.))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((To take pictures, dummy.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((Maybe this one's good⋯))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((This one?))[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]((I was wondering if I got a good picture.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay⋯ Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey! Where are you going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Toyotomi and those other guys⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? They're gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When did they leave?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Hehe. Did you follow me? Nothing gets past you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not true. I just saw Toyotomi was here in the park.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Curiosity is a good thing. That's the spirit of journalism.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]You keep asking. Listen–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can see you were taking pictures. I'm asking you what's up with the camera?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Well, a camera is–[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know it's for taking pictures.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Oh, really?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What I want to know is, why are you taking pictures of them with the camera?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Heehee.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What?[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Are you curious?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, a little.[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]If you come to the Evening Caf⑮ tomorrow at five o'clock, I'll tell you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]I'm sure you can agree to those conditions. I'm not running a charity here. I don't have to show you all my cards.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Okay, I got some good pictures, so now let's get them developed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kaori[line]Now now, don't give me that look. If you come tomorrow, I'll tell you as a reward.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should head back to the Heights. Staying here won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]So⋯that's why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't be here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be better if I could get to the other side.)[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]Listen. These are the steps. First, she'll have⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]I steal that⋯[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Then I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit, this seems like a big deal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And it sounds really illegal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Okay, so Toyotomi will⋯[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Hahaha, this masterpiece⋯yours?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I'm a feminist. I⋯never force⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Could they be having a shady conversation?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit, I can't hear them clearly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It'd be better if I could get to the other side or something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to Toyotomi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But they'll catch me if I get too close⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't think I can hear them from too far away though.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's how it is. I'm not involved⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]I see⋯ But if you're gonna do it, you gotta be thorough⋯[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]So⋯[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]I don't want any violence. I'm not involved⋯[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Heh, got it. You're not involved, right?[%p]
[name]Toyotomi[line]That's right.[%p]
[name]Skinny Man[line]Hm, Toyotomi. If we get paid⋯no involvement.[%p]
[name]Fat Man[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](They're smiling while they talk⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they talking about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Toyotomi, the guy that directs construction.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's Ayumi's underling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But what is he doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I want to grab those hands and crush them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't care about this guy's hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Don't you want to listen to Toyotomi now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a pretty expensive-looking suit. Damn.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Didn't he say it was a burlap suit or something?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That doesn't matter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The skinny guy's eyes are totally lifeless.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What a cold stare. He's like a snake.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know it's not good to judge people by their looks, but he looks like a bad guy.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do they have to do with Toyotomi?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These guys are strange no matter how you look at them.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Looks like a rugby player in a suit.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Other than that heinous face⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](These three really stand out in the park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Inside Meiunji Park⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There are fewer couples here today than usual.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey. Is it really the time to be using that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should listen to Toyotomi talk now.)[%p]
