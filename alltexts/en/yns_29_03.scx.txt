[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there really no one here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Behind this rock?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I start turning rocks over, I'll just find bugs, so I won't.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really quiet around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What happened to her?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The mansion is pretty quiet, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki said something about Ryuuzouji not being here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is the old lady not here either?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's in the stream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It'd be bad if they were.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Could they be underwater in the stream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A stone bridge over the stream.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This garden is full of greenery.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are so many trees back there, you could call it the woods.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was pretty sure she went in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was it Mitsuki? No, if it were her, why would she hide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, I don't know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right, I should go to the storehouse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki might be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why don't we try looking a bit more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait. Aren't you curious about that person?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I don't see Mitsuki around, there's a strong possibility that was her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if that's the case, I don't know why she's still hiding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back to the main house again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki told me on the phone that she was inside the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If she's here, she should be inside the main house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Isn't it too quiet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go there.[%p]
