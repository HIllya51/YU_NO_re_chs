[name]Takuya[line]It's a mild sprain.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean, no? I can't see what it is without checking it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All we need is to wrap it up with some bandages.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes, thank you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, you're⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're not the best student in class, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But you know other things. A lot of things they don't teach you in school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Heh heh, I'm pretty good down there, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Dummy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How's your ankle?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't it feel much better?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, you're right⋯it doesn't hurt anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good. Apply a pain relief patch and some bandages, then just keep your ankle set in place. You should feel much better in a day.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, it's nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wish I learned things that would help me live a better, enriched life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. The point is, I think that intuition is what's important.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Intuition?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone who's fallen into a rut can't be helped out of it. That intuition that you want to do something and the ability to practice it⋯ That's what's important.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some say that school is boring, and even makes you stupid. But if you don't go, does everything work out okay then?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't think so.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Those guys are blaming their own lack of intuition on their surrounding environment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're motivated, you can deal with any environment. That's what I think.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's what the old bastard said to me when I whined about school being so boring.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wow.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He told me, if I find something I wanted to do and if that's something I can't do while attending school, then I can quit.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You had a good father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so? Well, he did live several decades longer than I have. I guess I should've listened to him more often.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*smirk*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You know, all they teach you in school is so one-sided, and only in order to pass the exams.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, I guess you could call it that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]When I look at you, I get so frustrated about what I'm doing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's wrong. School is not just for studying.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well⋯ I guess you're right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no other opportunity to interact with people of the same age range, other than school. In that sense, it's been good for me.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima, you don't go out with classmates much, do you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You think so?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, you were practicing all by yourself during club activities and you don't come to parties, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How does she know that?)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But you know what?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You sound like a doctor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah hah. Long ago, I was trained by my father, a guy who traveled around the world.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Interesting⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He taught me all sorts of knowledge he acquired during his travels.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I thought historians stayed indoors and stared at documents all day.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, there are people like that, but my father is an exception among exceptions. He taught me a lot of random things.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's great.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not great. Because of that, my school grades were always bad, except history.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, you're different. An honor student with excellent grades.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wanted to learn more⋯like you did.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait, you shouldn't be lifting it so high.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Please be gentle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, this won't hurt. I'll make you feel good.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That sounds vulgar.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, next. I'll set the ankle with a bandage.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Can you do that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course.[%p]
*rip*[%p]
*pat*[%p]
*stick*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So, what do you think?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wow, amazing. My ankle doesn't hurt at all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who is it? It's so late at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No clue.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I thought I heard voices⋯ Geez.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see. Mitsuki, are you on night shift tonight?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's just temporary until Ms. Takeda comes back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry. I'm using it for treatment at the moment.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's fine but⋯did something happen?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yes, she twisted her ankle.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I heard some loud noise at the coastline a while ago. Is it related to that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No, nothing to do with it.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's good. Hehe, did I disturb you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You didn't disturb us but I think it's rude.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Mio. That's not⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* Oh, sorry. I'm glad I didn't catch you in the middle of something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]In the middle of what? Hey, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]*glare*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, Mio. Can we please just⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I think it's far better than a female teacher luring students into the laboratory.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hah hah, you hate me now, don't you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Mio⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]May I say one more thing?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]As you wish.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Can you please leave? You're disturbing us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](H-Hey⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I have a bad feeling about this.)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I'm on night shift tonight. You two broke the rules and entered here, and used medical equipment without permission.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then please appeal to the court or wherever.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I won't file a complaint, but I can warn you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't want to hear it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop it⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I can call you to the teacher's office tomorrow afternoon, and have a nice, long talk, you know.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]As you please. Bring it up at the staff meeting if you want.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Maybe I will.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey! Stop![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Eek![%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki, can I please talk to you?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, all right.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio, you can head down to the main hall. I'll be there soon.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll be right there.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Sheesh⋯she was giving me the evil eye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Please, Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Blow for blow, tit for tat. Sorry, I shouldn't have done that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She twisted her ankle. So we came to see Ms. Eriko, but nobody was here.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I trust you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Thanks.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]However.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]From now on, don't come in to the school after hours. This is a warning as a teacher.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. I'll keep that in mind.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]*smirk* You're making me jealous. There's some chemistry between you two.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Were you eavesdropping on us?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]That's not a very nice thing to say. I happen to hear you talking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's all right. I'll keep my sweet moments with you, deep inside my heart.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, please don't say stuff like that, especially in front of her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Hehe, getting panicky? Don't be ridiculous. I wouldn't do such a foolish thing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hrm⋯)[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You like her, don't you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't dislike her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Answer yes or no.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I like her. But I don't love her.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Don't try to look big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Listen⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]Now, go. Isn't she waiting for you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, do you really have a staff meeting tomorrow?[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]It's a lie, of course. I'm not that rude.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry. Well then⋯[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]You're clumsy as usual, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Mitsuki[line]I⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? I thought I told her to wait for me in the main hall.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where is she walking around?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Why would you come out like a ghost?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go. I'll walk you home.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll go by myself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, that's impossible.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not impos–[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ouch![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course it is. I only put a pain relief patch and taped up your ankle. You need a day to heal.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, well⋯ Here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What do you mean? Why are you hunching over?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here, get on.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, that's embarrassing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How are you gonna go home then? We don't have a magic carpet.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'll take a taxi.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Tons of taxis in front of a school in the dead of night.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here. Hurry, I don't wanna be crouching all night long.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]B-But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just listen to what I say.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Oh, all right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oof.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, quit sounding like you're carrying something heavy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're not as light as a feather.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hmph⋯ Hey![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You're touching my butt. Pervert![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ouch⋯ Hey, don't hit me like that.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's your fault![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is how you give a piggyback ride. Stay still, won't you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No! I don't want anyone to see this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't worry, with a bandage around your ankle, everyone will think you're just injured.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So stay still. It's not easy giving a piggyback ride.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sheesh⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This ain't easy at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, I have to piggyback her all the way to her home.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm telling you, I don't have designs on her.)[%p]
*boink*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]H-Hey.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a piggyback ride. Nothing I can do about it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, at least this feels nice.)
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew, we're finally downtown.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I told her I'd give her a piggyback ride, so I can't quit here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it's pretty hard to keep going like this.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, at least she's quiet. It helps.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Phew⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oops, can't let her hear me sighing.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But I should work out more, seriously.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's over a month since I quit club activities.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I guess that was good exercise for me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey, are you okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Am I too heavy?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah you are.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]E-Excuse me?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're heavy, but not a burden.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph, too late for excuses now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What excuse?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's enough talk. Be a man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's gender discrimination.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hrmph⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, let's do it quick.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'll put the pain relief patch on.[%p]
*stick*
[name]Mio[line]Ah, oh feels good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can you say that again?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Never.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It still hurts a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll continue massaging for a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll give you a little massage. You'll feel much better.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Thank you.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wait, what are you doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, if I don't touch, I can't tell, can I?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Wh-What do you mean?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a diagnosis.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, how about this?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Nothing's wrong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So it doesn't hurt, huh? Then how about this?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Does it hurt?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, but I feel it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, how about this?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Mmaaah!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I see.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hey⋯ow! I'm crying![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm treating your leg.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What kind of treatment is this?! Ow ow ow⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a little twist. It's not sprained.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Knock it off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*lick*[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you okay, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*kiss*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I do that, I'm sure she'll give me a Spinning Bird Kick.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What are you saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I didn't see anything.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh, boy.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's wrong with your eyes, Arima?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah ha ha, it's nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should stop.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Once you lose someone's trust, recovering it takes a huge amount of time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what are you looking at?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not where I should look.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No⋯nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](White thighs, a little dazzling.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Crystal clear pale legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No. Uh-uh. I shouldn't⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why are you closing your eyes and shaking your head?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio has beautiful legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Does she play any sports?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bust⋯it may be surprisingly big.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She would never dream that I'm guessing her cup size.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hahaha![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Are you⋯okay?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, the size of her underbust might be smaller.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it a 32C?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](32B⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems anxious, and looks so cute.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](However, I can never say that to her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking at me and her own legs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's looking a little bit anxious.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Beautiful hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Curly hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's flowing and clinging to her body.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm treating Mio's leg now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She is sitting with her leg lifted in front of me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a dangerous situation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It seems like nobody's here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Except for Mio and I.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A quiet school infirmary.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just me and Mio, alone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't need any items now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey⋯)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What's going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hah hah hah. Nothing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to use items.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This doesn't seem like the right time to use that.)[%p]
