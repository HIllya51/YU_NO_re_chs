[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the dry well, but it looks like Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where are you looking?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the dry well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the dry well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's bigger than I thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's a crime for a family to own this much land.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]How long has it been since I've walked under the trees like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can hear birds singing far in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like Sakaimachi is becoming pretty modern.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It might actually be rare to have so much greenery left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There must be some significance to the existence of this spooky mansion. Hence all the rumors about a curse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't you feel like we've been walking a pretty long time?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's a little strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how big Ryuuzouji's mansion is, this is too much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I lose my sense of direction?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'm just walking around in circles.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's ridiculous. I'm not in the mountains.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it opened up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This looks pretty different.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't really think this is that spooky mansion's garden.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's with this mansion?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is that the well I can see over there?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I just have to go there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck was Mitsuki doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's bigger than I thought.[%p]
