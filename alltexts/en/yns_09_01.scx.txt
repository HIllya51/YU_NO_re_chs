[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are clothes left on the chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said something about night shift, but where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. Damn, Ms. Eriko really is like a butterfly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are clothes left on the chair again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko never changes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought she was just at the mansion.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said it was some kind of regular staff meeting, but that seems suspicious to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko is never here. Is she really the school physician?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯there aren't any wadded up tissues thrown away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ew, could this red-stained cloth be⋯could it be what I think it is?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's probably just gauze used to wipe away a cut.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell was I expecting?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's gauze and tape thrown away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's only natural, considering it's the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko's clothes and physician's coat have been tossed here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ Where did that teacher go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko's clothes and physician's coat have been tossed here⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Damn⋯ Where did that teacher go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko sits in this seat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her underwear isn't there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, hey. This is Ms. Eriko's physician's coat and her clothes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And⋯her underwear?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I shouldn't let this distract me. The problem is, why are Ms. Eriko's clothes and underwear left here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Her underwear is just sitting there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Why am I trying to smell it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I can't go against this urge to⋯ugh![%p]
[name]Voice[line]What are you doing, you moron![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, it's you, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Looks like your true form has come to light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My true form?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Yes. A pervert has been revealed to be⋯a down right dirty pervert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Calm down, Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What? You're always up to no good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you saying? I'm the poster boy for the pure of heart![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't say that while you're holding someone's bra in your hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Umm. This isn't what it looks like.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Show me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]O-Okay, I got it.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And zip up your pants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geez, so demanding.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I mean, show me Ms. Takeda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell? It's not like I'm hiding her in my pocket or something.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wouldn't put it past you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I would never![%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then what's with the clothes and underwear strewn about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They were just strewn about.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And their owner?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told you, I don't know. Maybe she shed her clothes off and flew away?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She's not a butterfly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course she isn't.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just calm down a little. What are you here for anyway?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What am I here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, you've been coming to the school infirmary a lot lately.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This has nothing to do with you. I just have some business with Ms. Takeda.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, she does seem to flutter off like a butterfly sometimes.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Anyway, give it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You want 100 yen?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Who wants a 100 yen coin?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I do.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was just kidding! If you keep getting angry like that, you'll get more wrinkles.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Hurry up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk, if it were my love you wanted, I could give you so much.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No thank you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Here's your precious bra.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Pervert.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio's putting away Ms. Eriko's clothes and underwear in a cabinet.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wanted to bask in their warmth just a little longer.)[%p]
[name]Mio[line]What the heck are you grinning for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Summer remedial classes with Yuuki are very fun, you know.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well isn't that jolly.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You idiot![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who are you calling an idiot?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What're you so upset about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe⋯you have a bad case of constipation.[auto-forward][linebreak][linebreak]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Mio[line]I'm not constipated![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk about eavesdropping, sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what about Ms. Eriko?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did she really just take her clothes off and go somewhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A five-legged chair. Ms. Eriko probably uses this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's just a normal chair. A five-legged chair is a thing of beauty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When you lean back on a four-legged chair, it tips over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it won't with five legs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who am I explaining this to?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko sits here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sniff sniff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It doesn't have any particular scent to it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What particular scent would I be sniffing for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't have any plans.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's summer vacation, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯ Female students have their measurements taken at the beginning of the second semester in September, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should write the dates down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wish she'd just sit here and listen to all my sexual frustrations.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She'd probably kick me out, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where Ms. Eriko works.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be doing all kinds of work here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A vent⋯it lets air in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a vent for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels nice and cool on my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's open. Which means no one's sleeping.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When someone is using the bed, this is always closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Use the bed? What do they use it for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I napped a lot here my first and second years.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Recently I've been spending my time on the roof.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Since the curtains are open, it's easy to deduce that no one's using the bed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess you don't need a detective to see that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The window is closed because the AC is on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold air is coming out of here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cold air is flowing out. The AC must be on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that feels good.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the AC's actuator.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you open this, you can see the fan inside spinning around like a washing machine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not going to open it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So this is where air flows through.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a vent for air circulation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It feels nice and cool on my hand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a shelf full of medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me take a peek inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yup, nothing but medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A cabinet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet there's medicine and first aid supplies inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medicine box. Don't find much use for this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's anything I am, it's healthy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A medicine box full of medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't feel nauseous right now, and I don't have a headache.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's one way to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could just throw a chair at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This window is set in the frame, so I can't open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]An empty school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I dawdling around for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go somewhere else.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A memo board.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know, let's go back to the main hall.[%p]
