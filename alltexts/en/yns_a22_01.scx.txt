[name]Takuya[line]This is the base of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that noise?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it an earthquake? No, this is⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is going on?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that rock over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a hole in it. It's pretty big.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like I can climb down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Luckily I have my flashlight with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]According to my old man's journal, if I came here at this hour with 10 Jewels, something would happen.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then, there's this big hole at the foot of Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Doesn't leave much room for thought.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should go look inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing I can do here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Open the map, or 「Keep Map and Items As Is」 and continue playing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's nothing I can do here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like nothing will happen unless I have 10 [Jewels].[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to get those Jewels from somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean makes it sound like it's buzzing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's waving so sadly. No one seems to be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some kind of letters. No need to read them now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's said that they were written approximately 400 years ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I be reading this now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That girl was on the ground here at Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was she, anyway?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a mysterious rock⋯ I feel strange about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks too contrived to be made by nature.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no proof that any of this is man-made though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Triangle Mountain is right there, as quiet as ever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here but me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The journal told me to come here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because I don't have 10 Jewels?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here. It's a bit chilly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure I was facing off with Ryuuzouji here just a minute ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I can't do much hanging around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the coastline.[%p]
