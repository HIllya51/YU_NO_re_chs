[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is being attacked right in front of me!)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Good⋯ No need to say anything else⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna isn't saying anything⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she doesn't look afraid at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Such a strong woman.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima⋯please leave. Now![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I told you to keep your mouth shut![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You won't get away with this![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh, you keep quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This bastard isn't going to get away with this!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But seriously, what's up with Houjou?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This guy is completely mad⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, you shouldn't be here![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]This person⋯ No, the person behind this person is trying to–[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Shut up![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ahhh!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You bastard![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Whoa there, don't move. Can't you see this shiny thing in my hand?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh, heh⋯ Good, that's it.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please⋯stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna hasn't noticed.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I'm fine with that. If you don't give it up, I'll just cut her into pieces.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Actually, I'd prefer that. I've always wanted to slice up the face of a young woman.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I give it to him⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](⋯ I'll never be able to get back to where I came from⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll never be able to look for my old man again.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What do I do?!)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]If you're going to blame anyone, blame this kid, Kanna.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Let me go![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Now, it's slicin' time![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, you win! I'll give it to you![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]A-Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh. I was hoping you'd say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Slowly. Hand it over slowly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let her go first![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You think you're in the position to negotiate? Haha.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Uhhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]F-Fine. But once I give it to you, release her.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Sure, I'll let her go.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]He's lying! He won't![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Shut up![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Ahhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop! I'll give you the jewel![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh⋯ All right.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, no!!![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Agh! Knocked the knife out of my hand?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now's my chance! He dropped his knife!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Raaaaahh!!![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]N-No, take it easy on me! I didn't mean any harm![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Give me a break! Don't you know the difference between right and wrong?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]A-Arima⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna, what's wrong? You're pale as a ghost![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]The necklace⋯hurry⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? The necklace?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Kaaah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey, wait! I won't let you get away![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Haa⋯haa⋯haah⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Give it up, there's nowhere left for you to run.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh⋯ Muahahaha![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Has this guy gone completely mad?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh boy, I wouldn't get any closer if I were you. Now, give it to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Are you half asleep or something? Let me give you a little something to make up for all this.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Whoa there. This gemstone doesn't do well in water, right Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]*gasp*[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]If you get any closer, I'll throw this right into the fountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's he talking about?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh heh⋯ Looks like this guy doesn't know. This is Kanna's life itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What do you think will happen when I throw it in the water? It will deteriorate, and Kanna will grow so weak that she'll die within the next 10 minutes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Psh, where did you get that idea?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, but look at Kanna. She's acting strange.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's right. She is acting very strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's like everything he says is true⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯that can't be.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Mmm.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it true?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Of course it is. She'll die the second it touches the water.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Now, now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna will die?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just from him throwing her necklace in the water?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not scientific at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But she's acting so strange⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And if⋯ If he's right, there won't be any way I can bring her back.)
[name]Takuya[line](Plus⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((If I lose this, I'll die.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Die?))[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]((Yes.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]((Hahaha, I get it. That's how important it is to you.))[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But that's⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It means that it's more important than my own life.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right⋯ Wait, what?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Houjou is lying⋯ What he says is complete nonsense.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]That necklace is important to me, but there's no need for you to worry, Arima.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What did you say?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I-I'll really throw it in there.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Go ahead.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I-I really, really will.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Bahaha! Look at your face! You're worried to death![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Then I'll throw it in myself![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What are you doing?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hiya![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You⋯ What is wrong with you?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Now you have nothing to negotiate with.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Urrrgghh! It's come to this![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the–?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Gahaha! The tables have turned again![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Houjou?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I didn't want to kill anyone, so I've been hiding this. I'm glad I borrowed this from my boss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](His boss?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I'm an amateur when it comes to guns, but at this range, I can't miss.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop this madness! Are you really going to kill someone over a simple job?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Sh-Shut uuup! I'm⋯*grunt* I'm⋯aggghhh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Houjou's gone completely insane!)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It was no use negotiating in the first place. I'll just kill you with this and take the jewel.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this where it all ends?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this where I⋯?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Die!!![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'm still⋯alive.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could this mean?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Houjou's on the ground.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought I was the one who got shot⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But still, Houjou was completely out of his mind.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell happened to him?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]It's what they call Niarb.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms⋯ Ms. Eriko?![%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Whew, that was a close one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Gosh, I told you to call for me, didn't I? You were nearly a goner.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So⋯ So that means⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You did this to him?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]He was consumed by the Niarb. He didn't seem like a normal guy, did he?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Niarb? What's that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It's a type of hypnosis. But unlike other types of hypnosis, you still have your own consciousness while it's active.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know what you're talking about.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]In other words, you're being cleverly controlled while thinking it's your own volition.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I understand even less now⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]That's fine. Anyway, this man was under hypnosis.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who would hypnotize him?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Probably whoever hired him to do this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]His boss?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Exactly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who is Houjou's boss?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are they after my old man?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Sorry to tell you this now, but I was listening in for a minute.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]This Houjou guy mentioned the word 「jewel,」 right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, right⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]And that you have it with you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't remember having anything like that.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]So what are you going to do? Go to the police?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]It would make sense, seeing what happened here. What are you going to do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't plan on going to the cops. I can't really explain the details to them.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]I see. Hatano?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]What are you going to do? You're the biggest victim here.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I⋯agree with Arima.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Okay. I'll take Houjou with me then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What? Why are you going to take him?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]When he wakes up, I'll have a lot to ask him about.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Will you be okay? This dude is definitely not normal.[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Oh, are you worried about me? How sweet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-Who are you calling sweet?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Takuya Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What's with that?[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]If you ever want to talk about things, come to me. I'll hear you out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Eriko[line]Later.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eriko dragged Houjou away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lightning?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it another accident?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's raining⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna, it's raining. We should go.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna? You don't look too good.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]My heart is racing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet. That was quite the situation to get caught up in.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Yes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah. I'm going to go get that necklace that dirt bag threw in the fountain.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It's too late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you mean? We'll just wash it off and dry that thing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]K-Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]H-Hey⋯ Are you okay?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, that's a serious fever.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]F-For now⋯ Let's just get you under the tree in the grass. Let's get her rested over there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But man, this fever is off the charts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the heck happened?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We won't be in the rain if we're under this tree.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ No one's even around to ask for help.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko already left.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope Kanna's okay.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]We talked about you-know-what before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you talking about?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]It's like a crystal ball with glass beads.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]My boss has reasons to believe you have it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I-I don't know anything about it.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh, you don't? Heard it was a keepsake of Koudai Arima though.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Why⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Maybe you'll remember as I slowly slice into Kanna here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]S-Stop it![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hehehe⋯ What shall we do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit! What am I going to do?!)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Gahaha, look who's quiet all of a sudden. The both of you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let her go right now.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Only if you concede to my conditions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What conditions?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Arima, no!!![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Aahh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop that right now![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Listen to me, kid.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I talked to you before once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Me⋯?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Yeah. *gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]M-My head⋯ I-It's killing me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's up with him?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Dammit, listen here⋯ Uahhh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is this guy okay?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Stay right there, you⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Even if I wanted to move, I probably couldn't.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Huahaha⋯ Guh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the hell is happening to Houjou?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I knew he wasn't a good guy, but I didn't think he was this messed up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's completely in a world of his own.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, can you knock it off?[%p]
[name]Man[line]Doesn't this just turn you on, Kanna?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Let me go![%p]
[name]Man[line]Oh, don't tell me you don't see this shiny thing.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's completely in a world of his own.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, old man![%p]
[name]Man[line]Gahaha⋯ I've always wanted to do this kind of stuff with you.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]S-Stop it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit, he can't hear me.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He doesn't look normal at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, it's not like holding a knife to a young woman in the middle of the woods is normal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's got the crazy eyes.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just what the heck is going on here?)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]You know it's not nice to stare at people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What's gotten into Houjou?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Something is definitely not right with him.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What are you staring at?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't see from here!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who the hell is that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit. I can't make anything out from here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn, I have to do something about that knife.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](As long as he has that knife, I can't do jack.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's got the knife pressed against Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He has a knife.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't approach him carelessly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Forget about me, I'll put Kanna in a lot of danger if I do that⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a knife!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](How could he hold a knife to a girl like that?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now is not the time.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Didn't you hear me when I told you not to move?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I probably shouldn't instigate right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My chance will come around eventually.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Oh ho, quick as ever, aren't you kid?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]If you take so much as one step, I'll slash her face open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tch⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Right, I can take this guy on with my fists!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, old man![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hit![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It didn't work? But I really laid into him![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]A-Arima?![%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hmm? What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Y-You're Houjou, aren't you?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What the heck is he doing here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Well, we did arrange to meet here, so I guess this was inevitable⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, that's not what I meant!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why in the world is he attacking Kanna?!)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Kid, you better stay out of my way![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Houjou⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He's got a lot of crazy in those eyes of his.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait⋯ I haven't grasped the situation yet!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait a second.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I need to get a grasp on this situation first.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is there any way I can help her?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Think Takuya, think.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is scared.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's amazing that she isn't crying and screaming at the top of her lungs. What a trooper.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, what am I calmly staring at?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be gazing around!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is the time for action!)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I⋯don't know.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Man[line]I'm going to keep punching you until you tell me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, Kanna is getting beat up right in front of me!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be watching!)[%p]
[name]Man[line]Now tell me![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]I don't know⋯ I told you I don't know![%p]
[name]Man[line]Still playing stupid, are you?![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Grr⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That bastard punched her!)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Stop⋯ Gaah![%p]
[name]Man[line]Keep quiet![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn it⋯ This guy⋯)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Please, stop![%p]
[name]Man[line]Hurry up and come out with it already! Tell me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Kanna is⋯being attacked by some guy?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Inside the woods of Meiunji Park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why tonight, of all nights, is no one here?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the time to be looking at that!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Inside the woods of Meiunji Park.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why is it that tonight, of all nights, there aren't even any couples here?!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Or maybe they saw this and ran away⋯)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What, do you want to see more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Damn, you sure have a glare for such a young guy.[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Hehehe, I guess you're a man after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not watching.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Stop it. I need to get a grasp on the situation.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](You think it's a good idea to be looking at that now?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I might say that, but then I end up looking at it. How sad⋯)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Don't you move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯ There's nothing I can do.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh heh heh, do you want to see more?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Stop![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Dammit, don't touch her with those dirty hands!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That guy's hand is on Kanna's legs⋯)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]Heh, heh⋯ Yeah, look at what I've got in my hands.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He has a knife.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't move carelessly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be checking out her tits⋯)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]So you're a little creep too, huh? Heh heh heh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Damn⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is not the time to be looking at her boobs.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her boobs. I like how they're not so big.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Now is not the time to be assessing her chest!)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No, I can't use something so dangerous.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Come on now⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If I swing at him with something like this, he'll end up dead, I tell you.)[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]What's with that anyway?[%p]
[name]Houjou[line]I wouldn't be so careless if I were you. Kanna's face might end up sliced to pieces.[%p]
