[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No⋯sheesh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I told her not to go out by herself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems Yu-No went to pick nuts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I know where she went⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm the kind of guy who prefers function over form. This furniture placement is unexpectedly functional.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Illia is a bit utilitarian, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been four years, but this room hasn't changed a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the same as when Illia lived here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As usual, there's some weird vegetables hanging in the window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes likes this plant. And, for some reason, Yu-No likes it too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder why.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is always washing something in that sink.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Lately, she won't wear just the apron for me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She must be worried about Yu-No seeing her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing on the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing on the table⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's really clean⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're a family of three, but there are four chairs.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One of them has become a mini-table to put food on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are pots and things, but I don't need them right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Cups and plates. We have a lot of stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All of it in sets for three people.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No isn't here. She must have gone to pick nuts.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That means she has to be there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll go outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The bedroom?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think Celes is cleaning.[%p]
