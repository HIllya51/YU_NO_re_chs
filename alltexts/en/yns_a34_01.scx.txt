[name]Takuya[line]I read the old bastard's journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So tonight, I need to collect all ten Jewels.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's study never changes⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's as messy as always. Looks like Ayumi hasn't cleaned it up yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What about the fluorescent light on the ceiling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the ceiling light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like there's a fluorescent bulb inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a world map. Technically, it's a Mercator projection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a world map. Technically, it's a Mercator projection.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The globe is drawn on a square sheet of paper with the equator in the center, so the area ratios are all off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The area spreads out drastically as you get farther from the equator. This map only lets you get an idea of where each country is located.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a map.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man kept a map of each region for some reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hence all these rolled up papers⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not just here, the whole room is buried in books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's buried in books.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And not one of them looks interesting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are even books on the floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did that bastard read each and every one of these?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I read the journal again?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let me say this, it's long.[%p]
Read the note
Don't read the note
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I already read it once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This isn't something to read over and over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a desk. There's nothing special on it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a desk. My old man used to write here all the time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a chair with five legs. I don't need to sit down.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Five legs, how audacious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say a chair should have five legs, but do you know why?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With only four legs you'd fall right over when you leaned back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So with five legs, you have less of a chance of falling over.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lamp. I'm sure it's meant to be turned on when you work at the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a lamp. The room is bright now, so there's no need to turn it on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are books here. None of them particularly catch my eye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There were too many to put here, so some books were set on the bay window.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man's collection of books used to be in the thousands⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But apparently, he got rid of a bunch.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are books laying right where he left them.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A lot of books just laying around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When it gets to this point, you wonder if you should even try cleaning it up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't need to slide it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a book shelf that can slide open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's another book shelf behind this one.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A pendulum clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I already got the Jewel inside it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What⋯am I gonna do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A pendulum clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A pendulum clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's an antique clock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't remember when, but the old man brought it back from somewhere and said it was a rare find.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you want to go back in, you should select move to the study on the side of the screen⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is where the journal used to be⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's nothing left to take.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What, you want to read the journal that bad?[%p]
Read the note
Don't read the note
[name]Takuya[line]All right, I'll give it a read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The old man's journal. I'll put it on the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'm really not interested in stuff like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'm kinda curious.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No matter how much room you have for books, this is a bit much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll climb on the desk and try to grab it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*grunt* Oof![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, got it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not a book?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My old man's handwriting⋯ Is it a diary?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think⋯it's his journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what he wrote⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll read it at the desk.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's journal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What exactly did he write in it⋯[%p]
Read the note
Don't read the note
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. I'm not interested in stuff like this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll put it back.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I going to do now?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something on top.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like a book⋯ Come on, did my old man not have space for a single book?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There aren't really any books I want to read.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's full of books here, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the room won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My father's study. I almost never come in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd get in trouble if I went in without asking.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no one left to yell at me now though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a garbage can. It's empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The garbage can's empty.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did Ayumi take out the trash?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. Let's go back to the living room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something I haven't found yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should search the study from top to bottom. There must be something, somewhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait⋯ Does that there was a Jewel here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something in this room I haven't found yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. Staying here like this won't get me anywhere.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go back to the living room.[%p]
