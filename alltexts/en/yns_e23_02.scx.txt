[name]Takuya[line]This is the end of the fifth floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess Kanna's apartment is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Staring at the door won't help anything.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's weird that Kanna isn't home at this hour.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe she went out to eat or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Kanna said she didn't feel well.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door looks strong.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I open this, I'd be in Kanna's apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a steel door. It looks pretty tough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The nameplate says 「Hatano.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a nameplate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It says 「Hatano.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means this is definitely her apartment.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's open. Does that mean somebody's inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But, no matter how many times I rang the bell, no one came to the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should just go in.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hello![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm Kanna's–Kanna Hatano's–classmate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Someone's on the ground?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who could it be?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯ I wonder if I should just open it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It won't hurt to try.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, but⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one came when I rang the doorbell. That must mean nobody's home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I wait a little longer?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll ring the doorbell first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey⋯ Shouldn't I ring the doorbell first?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I just start turning the knob, I'll scare whoever's inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I rang the bell, but no one's answering.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm, I should just try ringing the doorbell one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If no one answers⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew it. She's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no way she's at the hospital or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if anyone is inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She told me she wasn't feeling well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It looks like no one's here. I'm not sure what to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I'll ring the doorbell first.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what if someone from her family answers?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem, I am Kanna Hatano's classmate. I brought this student handbook for her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ahem, I am Kanna Hatano's classmate.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That sounds dumb. What am I nervous about?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not too late yet. Okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's weird. Maybe no one's home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a quiet apartment building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know I shouldn't judge, but it's a lot cleaner than I expected.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The superintendent must be attentive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]With the management fee plus the maintenance fee, it must be super expensive.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯ I doubt the door is unlocked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Did I check it yet?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll wait a little longer.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She might be rushing to put some underwear on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't seen Kanna yet. It's too soon to move.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That being said, I haven't even rung the doorbell.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I haven't seen Kanna yet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What do you think I came here for?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should give her this handbook as soon as I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't tell what's going on inside from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hm⋯ I can't peek inside from here either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Kanna really not here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's no use. It won't work unless I look from the other side.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's designed to prevent you from seeing in from the outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's just how it works.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's illuminating the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The light is illuminating the painting.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess it's interior design.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]To be honest, I don't really understand art.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means I don't know the value of paintings.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Paintings hung in places like this are usually some innocuous landscape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And landscapes don't really excite anyone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which means anything is okay.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ceiling light⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a light that's set in the ceiling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's lighting up the hallway.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a plant, the same kind you see all over the place.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of those typical indoor plants.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's kinda hard to breathe in here. Maybe because they're not sucking up enough carbon dioxide?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a decorative ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? There aren't any cigarette butts inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess this is just a decoration?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think it's an ashtray.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna doesn't smoke, does she?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Am I here just to stare at this thing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have other things to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I press this, a siren will sound, then a firetruck, the police, and a bunch of busybodies will show up.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I bet even married couples would stop enjoying their 「quality time」 just to see what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I push it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a fire hose coiled up like a snake inside here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Even saying it is kinda gross.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The door I need isn't the one in front of me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's the next door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If there's no nameplate, does that mean that no one lives there?[%p]
