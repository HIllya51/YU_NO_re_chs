[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Dammit, where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is weird. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did I read this situation wrong?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I was pretty sure she would be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here now.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]My, my. We keep running into each other.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ryuuzouji.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he doing here?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph. This might be another connection of phenomena.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]What do you think of the word 「coincidence」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure how to answer that.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Well then, when do you use such a word?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The word coincidence?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]When something unexpected happens, I suppose.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Exactly. When a causal relationship line with a certain vector, crosses another causal line that has no universal foundation, we call that a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]However, what we call unexpected is simply information we cannot predict within our current situation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So even if it is something inevitable that had been decided beforehand, we still might see it as a coincidence.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What is he trying to say?)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Thanks to the construction being cancelled and the construction director not being around, it's quite easy to reach Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were you doing?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I have a particular scientific interest in Sword Cape, you see. Whenever I have free time, this is where I come.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Scientific interest, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](He sounds just like Mio.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]No, maybe that isn't the best way to put it. My interest isn't in the mountain, but rather the things that exist around it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What things?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Everything that involves Sword Cape, including Sakaimachi itself.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know a girl that says the exact same thing.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Oh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She also went to your house to check something out.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I see. You must be talking about Shimazu. She did come to my house. She was examining a tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is that tapestry-thing?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's been in my house for a long time. I have no idea why she'd be interested in it though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A tapestry, huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Actually, Mio mentioned something like that yesterday.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The tapestry in Ryuuzouji's house could be a big clue is what she said.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Is everything all right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yes, if you don't mind, can I have a look at that tapestry sometime?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So you're interested in it too? Like father, like son.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh⋯?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Koudai said the same thing before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My old man was interested in the tapestry at Ryuuzouji's house, huh.)[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Hmph, I guess it could be good to let you follow Koudai's steps.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Very well. Come to my mansion sometime. I'll show you the tapestry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that samurai mansion we can see from the school gate, right?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]So you know it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, yeah. I heard it got pretty famous at one point.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Yes, yes it did. It's the origin of that curse which was talked about a lot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]I'll be going home shortly after this, so come by then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Sorry, but I don't know where it is.[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]Don't you know that samurai mansion you can see from the school gate?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A samurai mansion you can see from the school gate?[%p]
[name]Ryuuzouji[line]It's the origin of that curse which is being talked about a lot. I'll be going home shortly after this, so come by then.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]He's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ryuuzouji's house is the mansion I can see from the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one was here earlier, either.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nothing but the sea behind Triangle Mountain. No point in going there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So does that mean Kanna just appeared out of nowhere?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No one's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could Mio have gone?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said she wanted to check out Sword Cape for one last intellectual inquiry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]At the foot of Triangle Mountain is the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I thought Mio would be here, but I guess not.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like no one is here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nobody's around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kanna was looking at something here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I came to the shrine, but no one's– Hm?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's Mio. She's early.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She must be investigating already. Wait.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Did Mio have hair like that?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Why would she need to hide like that all of a sudden?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's not Mio. Who is that woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Semi-long, black hair. It's too dark to see.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's bent down, examining something.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](At this time and place⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What could she be doing?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whoa, I can see even less now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If it wasn't Mio, then who could it have been?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Anyway, I should go check out where she was looking around.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a perfectly normal mountain of rocks.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what was she doing here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The base of Triangle Mountain. People call it the shrine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Seems like there's no one here right now.[%p]
[name]Mio's Voice[line]Why do you say that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, sorry![%p]
[name]Mio's Voice[line]You have no right to say that to me![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Wait, that voice.)[%p]
[name]Mio's Voice[line]Why would you warn me about that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Mio⋯ It's Mio's voice.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She sounds pretty angry. She must be arguing with someone.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But with who?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Mio⋯and Kanna.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What are they arguing about?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Why won't you say anything?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Because no matter what I say, it seems like you won't listen to me right now.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's not like you're involved in the construction, are you?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, I'm not.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then you have no right to tell me that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]But am I wrong?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well, no⋯it might be bad for me to be here without permission.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No, that's not what I mean.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Then what do you mean?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You know that lightning just struck again, don't you?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Y-Yes, I heard about that.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It could happen again.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But look at the sky. It's perfectly clear today.[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]It was clear before, too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]If you stay here, you might also be in danger.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]This whole thing seems so weird. Is it somehow inconvenient for you that I'm investigating Sword Cape?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]No. It's just too dangerous for you to be here.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I see how it is⋯ All I have to do is thank you for the warning, right?[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]Hmm⋯ All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whoa, she's coming right toward me.)[%p]
[name]Kanna[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey![%p]
[name]Kanna[line]You shouldn't be here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, Kanna![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Comes and goes like a passing breeze, that Kanna.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Arima.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mio.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You were watching us?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, let's just say I wouldn't call you mild-mannered anymore.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Ugh, you're always looking where you shouldn't be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like your boobs and butt?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]You idiot.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You were really loud. I heard you all the way from the school.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't be ridiculous.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So can I ask what you were talking about?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That girl, Kanna Hatano, she warned me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]About what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She told me I shouldn't be investigating things that have nothing to do with me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'd like to give you a warning about your ancient history mania too.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That has nothing to do with this.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know. Why would she say that though?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's what I asked her. I asked her why she thought she had the right to tell me something like that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]And?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She wouldn't answer me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, so what were you doing?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I was conducting a personal investigation.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I know that. How much did you investigate around here?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Well well, you're sounding a lot different from one month ago.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A man can change a lot in just a few days.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Not true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Tsk⋯ So what was Kanna doing here anyway?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I don't know. She just randomly showed up and told me I better leave.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I do wonder what she was doing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah. She's a weirdo.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She flows like air, that girl.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Good analogy. She seems so floaty.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]She isn't close with anyone at school, and there are some pretty bad rumors about her.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's up with that anyway?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Don't you know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Nope. I try to separate myself from worldly gossip.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]They say she's seeing multiple men at once.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, is that all? I'd be honored to spread my love equally among all the beauties of the world.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's okay for you because you're nothing but an animal.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]And⋯just the other day, she was at a hotel downtown.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So what?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Some students saw her come out with another man.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Free love, what's wrong with that?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It was a guy old enough to be her father.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]It's as if she thinks all of us are stupid and that she doesn't have time to mess around with us.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Did you see it?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I mean, did you actually see her come out of that hotel with a guy old enough to be her dad?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]No, I just heard about it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So you're criticizing Kanna because of a rumor you aren't even sure of yourself?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I wouldn't do that. You just asked me what kind of rumors there are so⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They're nothing but rumors though.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]But they say where there's smoke, there's fire, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Mio[line]I was only telling you about the rumors being spread at school. I don't have anything against her personally.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right. It takes around a month or two for an introvert like her to warm up to people.[%p]
[name]Mio[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's barely been a month since she transferred here, right?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]So you're taking her side?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait a second, are you jealous?[%p]
[name]Mio[line]That's not it![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something seems off here.[%p]
