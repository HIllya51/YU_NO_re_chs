[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is still out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* I stayed out late last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe Ayumi is mad at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the anti-fever medicine now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*huff⋯huff*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems I managed to get away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Shit, now it looks like I'm an accomplice.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What the hell is with that Kaori woman?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She said there was an intruder in Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If Ayumi is home, maybe I can ask her what's going on.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh? Wasn't there something I had to do right away?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the anti-fever medicine with me for some reason.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside of my home again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back and forth, back and forth. What am I even doing?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like there was somewhere I was supposed to go⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have the super powerful anti-fever medicine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I bring this over⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I think I heard something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, it kind of sounds like a weird siren.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it just my imagination?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sure it's my imagination.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I should hurry to where I need to be.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]My front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should hurry and do what I have to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I made it to my house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That thing I have to do⋯ I know what it is, don't I?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is Ayumi already back?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The wind from the ocean is a little cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's my front door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sun is still out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, someone's coming out of the entrance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh it's you, Ayumi. Are you finished with work already?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That would be nice. I still have a lot to do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, that's right. You did say this was a busy time for you.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. Oh, if I don't hurry, I'll be late.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do you have to be somewhere?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes. We're holding an information session for residents in front of the company building today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Like a briefing?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah, that's right. How did you know?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, you know. Oh, that reminds me⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yes? What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There was some woman looking for you, Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]A woman? I wonder who it was.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't know, but she was talking about the briefing.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hmm. Maybe it was someone from Geo Technics. I'll know when I get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You look busy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Yeah. The understanding of local residents is necessary for the construction to continue. So I have to do my best.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But you're against the construction, aren't you Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]That's my personal opinion. I have to follow company policy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Aah, I have to hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]W-Whoa.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I don't know how long this will take today. I'll call you later, sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]People used to say that it's good to be busy.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe. Thanks. All you need is an understanding family. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi took off.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The briefing, huh.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm outside my home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are we gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not in my nature to just sit around the house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where am I going?[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Oh, sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's a very beautiful woman.)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Excuse me, do you live here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh, yeah.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]But⋯ I heard that the owner had died?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm his son.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]His son? Oh my.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who is this woman?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I feel like I've seen her before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is it just my imagination?)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I didn't know Mrs. Arima had such a big son. Maybe a lovechild?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm her stepson. May I help you?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I was hoping to gauge Mrs. Arima's feelings before the briefing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Briefing?)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I was also hoping to ask her if I could film the briefing for television. Maybe she ran away.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]*smirk* Sorry. Bye.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Who was that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not sure if I've seen her before or not.[%p]
