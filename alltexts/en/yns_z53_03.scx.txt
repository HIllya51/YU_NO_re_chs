[name]Takuya[line]Now then. Let's look for Yu-No⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You went outside to look for Yu-No. Don't you remember?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Birds are singing far in the distance.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It makes everything seem so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's so quiet here. It feels so peaceful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yu-No might be over there. I should hurry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's just a house sitting in a wide open field. A knight named Illia used to live there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's been a while since I started living in this house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Not that you can see any difference from here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I renovated this place quite a bit.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]First, I made Yu-No's room and put it next to our bedroom.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It is time for her to have her own room, after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We can't all sleep in the same bed forever, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm gonna have to polish the stone soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I polish the stone once a year.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A house made of stone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Now, me and two others live in that house.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A plant that emits smoke when you touch it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's like a cactus with a bonbon on it. What a strange plant.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I probably shouldn't touch it carelessly. It'll spit out smoke if I do.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should we go inside?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go up this hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you're gonna go inside, just open the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Celes is going to get really angry if I keep doing meaningless stuff.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should give it a break.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I live here. No need to knock.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No way.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're in now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey. Let's try doing something less silly.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]As long as I'm around, that plant is going to keep growing.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should stop. It'll just get smoky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*cough*! This is some smoky smoke all right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's why they call it smoke, right? I wonder which came first. The word 「smoky」 or 「smoke」?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, just touching it and making the smoke come out is making this plant reproduce.[%p]
