[name]Takuya[line]I never expected to get into the school this late at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, I feel something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I knew someone that swapped their lights to look like this because it was stylish at the time. So tacky.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]These things are just going to make your eyesight worse.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's that so-called 「indirect lighting」⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark, so I can't tell⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, it's night time right now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It must be releasing stuffy CO2.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko, the school physician, must be the only one to use it⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Yeah. I have a feeling I'm right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]One of the many mysteries of this place⋯ Why is there an ashtray in the school hall?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯Maybe it's for guests?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Just a chair.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Some sofas arranged in a circle.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Must be one of those 「art objects.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's basically just a fancy way to say 「object.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What's that weird thing dangling from the ceiling?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]They say it was made using the sun as a motif⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a big painting⋯ I wonder who the artist is?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's difficult to see at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard that skylight slides open.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder how it opens⋯? Maybe it's automatic?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The stars are shining.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What a beautiful, star-filled sky.[%p]
「Congratulations! Now that you've found the Music Room, you've completed Yu-No!」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It seems like there's something different written here every time I look at it.[%p]
「This notice board displays your current coordinates. You are currently at the coordinates listed.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder if there's something new posted on this thing⋯[%p]
「This notice board displays your current map coordinates.」[%p]
「You are currently at these coordinates.」[%p]
「By the way, if you leave the Music Room now, it'll close.」[%p]
「Please look for it carefully.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What is it talking about? I don't get it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually, I remember something strange always being here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It almost feels like it's been watching over me for a long time now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Something's written here. What does it say?[%p]
「Hey, looks like we meet again. I'll tell you something for completing 100 percent.」[%p]
「At this time, the Music Room in the school is open. Try looking for it.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Music Room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what that means.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The Music Room is across the hall from the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can listen to this in the Main Menu now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]No point in looking at it now⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I may not know everything about the school, but I'd say I know just enough.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school's directory⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The hall, infirmary, and office are all on the first floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our classrooms are on the second floor and above.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]By the way, the Music Room⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯it's not here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe the Music Room was here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well, now I can listen to it from the Main Menu, so I don't have to come here anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm⋯ Something's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's going to be a surprise⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I saying?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The school infirmary is closed.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I should go to the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh, that's weird. It's locked.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ms. Eriko should be on night duty. Something's not right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's not on the second floor. The Music Room is across the hall from the school infirmary.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think I need to be on the second floor.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's something here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go inside the Music Room?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You can enter Music Mode from the Main Menu any time now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't enter the music room⋯ I don't have the sound source.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hold on⋯ Something's written on the door.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's see⋯[%p]
「To enter the music room, please provide the sound source.」[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hmm, thinking about it, there wasn't any music playing during the game⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If you think about it, it's pretty obvious. There is no point going in the music room when music won't even play.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's not go in the music room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh, I should look at the icon to move to such a small area.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]「Go inside.」 Hmm⋯ Something must be in here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Okay, I'm going inside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Right. I found the Music Room after all.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to get outside![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, outside?[%p]
