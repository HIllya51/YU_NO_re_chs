[name]Takuya[line]It's the front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, this isn't where I'm meeting Mitsuki.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Voice[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Um⋯ I'm sorry about before.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why are you apologizing?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It looks like I caused a misunderstanding.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A misunderstanding⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Shit⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I have to work a little longer. Sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm used to it now.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Those words⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Please⋯don't say that.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi went inside the company building.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I'm the one who's crazy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm in front of Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that was a workout, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯ I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But why did I come here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that always tires me out.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew, that was a workout, as usual.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]If I'm this tired, I must be really out of shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess quitting kendo affected me more than I thought.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Eek.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Ahh, my papers⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm sorry, I wasn't looking.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Oh no⋯oh dear⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's Ayumi.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the top of the hill at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But I'm beat.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* This company saps your strength and will.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I could fall asleep right here.[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]Can you let me by?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Huh⋯?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've seen her somewhere⋯)[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Now, how will I do it today?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Do it?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, are you going in here too?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You don't look like one of my colleagues. Do you work here?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm not directly involved, but I am invested, I guess.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Hmm⋯ Oh, right. Are you with the Citizens' Association?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Huh?[%p]
[name]Woman[line]I heard there will be a briefing from the company this afternoon. Did you come for that?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Woman[line]This company isn't looking so good. If you want to criticize them, you should do it now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm sorry, but I–[%p]
[name]Woman's Voice[line]You're here again.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]You're a nuisance. I told you I can't answer any questions.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Well, I'll have to use my talents to get around that.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I don't care if you're some famous newscaster. I was ordered not to let you in. No exceptions.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]You're stubborn. Didn't you hear that I'm inviting the head facilitator to the studio tonight?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I heard, but that's different than this.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Different?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]The head facilitator will go directly to the studio. Letting you in here is a completely different matter.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Oh, well. I'll get inside eventually.[%p]
[name]Woman[line]Sorry, I'm going past you.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ah, okay⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Nothing I can do about it.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Wait, who are you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Eh⋯hi.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Have we met?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I see lots of people every day, so I can't remember faces. Can I help you?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Actually⋯[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]Oh, it's a call. Whew, don't even have time to rest.[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]So do you understand, kiddo?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Kiddo?[%p]
[name]Female Guard[line]I can't let you in here even if you are immediate family. If you need to contact employees inside, call them by using the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]She's gone. She seems so busy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you gonna do?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew⋯whew⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe because it's on top of a hill, but this climb is hard for me since I stopped hitting the gym. Whew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I said it wouldn't cost anything to come, but it's good exercise⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Since the building is on a hill.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]So Ayumi is climbing up this slope every day. I wonder if that's how she keeps herself in shape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What am I thinking at a time like this?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Whew.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, I can see it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Geo Technics.[%p]
