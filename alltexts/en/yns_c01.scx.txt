[name]Takuya[line]Okay.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Close your eyes.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya, thank you so much for today.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ooh![%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's something soft on my lips.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No way⋯)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Goodnight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I must have imagined that. There's no way.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](*sigh* Maybe I'm more tired than I thought.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's never spoken so harshly to me before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](“Never do that again”, huh?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whether I was late, had to go to extra classes, got in a fight or caught up in some scandal, she always told me to do my best with a smile.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But not this time.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I've never seen her look like that before.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Time for bed.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll talk to her again when I wake up.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](And then⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wait, this is my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Was that a dream?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can't believe I had a dream where Ayumi did that to me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe I had some pent up emotions.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Come to think of it, where is Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room again, but Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Where could she be?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like I really need to find her soon.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Back at my room again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Looks like Ayumi went out somewhere. Something doesn't feel right though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's strange. Where did she go?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's no medicine in my room for headaches.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room again.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's already dark outside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to read my father's letter one more time.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Then I might understand why Ayumi's acting the way she is.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm back in my room.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi isn't here, of course.[%p]
