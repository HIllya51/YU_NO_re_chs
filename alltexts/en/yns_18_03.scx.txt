[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I took the long way, but I can get to the school from the stairs on the right.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I want to see Mitsuki as soon as I can.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The coastline is quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I wonder what's gonna happen with the construction now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The beach is quiet. Looks like no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard there was a lightning strike here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's a strong sense of panic in the air.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I heard there was a lightning strike here last night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All the construction workers have gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. All the construction workers have gone home.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Which reminds me, I feel like I had plans this evening.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What were they?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'm at the coastline. Still under construction, as always.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the coastline.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater to block high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a breakwater.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Our town is on the right. I guess it's for high waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There are plants growing here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Plants are growing around here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]There's grass down the stairs here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sand is shining in the sunlight.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The construction takes away the refreshing feeling.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a date spot at night before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Of course, no one's here now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]We have to make a direct appeal to the company to stop construction.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I wonder what will happen to us.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]It finally happened again.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Huh? What's going on?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Lightning. Light-ning. I heard there was another strike last night.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]*sigh* The pay is good, but there's a lot of accidents.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I shoulda' taken another job. I hear this construction is cursed.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]This job has gotten pretty bad.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Just today they're supposed to have a briefing for the local residents.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]But that's just a drop in the bucket.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Things aren't looking good for Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]The rumors about kickbacks are spreading even to us now.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Why are they continuing construction with all that's going on?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]According to the rumors, a little something changed hands between the mayor and Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Don't you know? It's what they call a 「money pie.」[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Damn, I don't care what they do on high, but I wish they'd keep us out of it.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]Don't you think so?[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I don't care how good the pay is. My life is more important.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]They say these clothes are electrically insulated, but they're just covered in vinyl.[%p]
[name]Worker[line]I don't know if they'd help against a lightning strike.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The truck must be for moving earth and sand.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But if they just leave it out here, it'll be bad for the engine.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That ocean breeze always blows at night.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's a truck. They must be transporting something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But what are they transporting? This is a geological survey, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's for transporting dirt and sand or something.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This ocean is so beautiful.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I hope the construction finishes soon so I can swim.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's still hot and perfect for the beach, but no one's swimming.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's because of the construction, too.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But Ayumi's in charge of it, so I can't really say much.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I can faintly hear the whispering of the waves.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The ocean is dark and quiet.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I guess the proper name is Sword Cape.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Almost nobody around here calls it that, though.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's one of the sights of Sakaimachi. It's known as Triangle Mountain.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's dark. It's night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is bright and blue, but it looks gloomy.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Maybe it's just me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]The sky is dark and cold.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like it's gonna suck me in if I keep staring at it.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is this what a geological survey looks like?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I feel like they could do it on a smaller scale.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This is the construction site's fence. Apparently they're doing a geological survey inside.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]From what I saw from the rooftop, it looked like they're digging up the beach for all its worth.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]This was a pretty nice place before the construction started.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's rather quiet now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is it because the construction's on hiatus?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All that rumbling from the construction is loud. *sigh*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]It's quiet all around. Nobody's here.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Why do I have to climb that hill?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*sigh* All right, I should just go, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to climb a pretty steep hill to get there.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]All right, it'll tire me out, but I'll go to Geo Technics.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh yeah, I have to go to school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Mitsuki didn't sound so normal on the phone.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Let's go right away![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I'll try going to the school.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Should I go back home?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's not where I want to go.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Oh well⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Going to the shrine at the foot of the mountain, right?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I have to make sure that bastard doesn't find me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]But it is night now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I don't think that Toyotomi is very serious about his work.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I'll head over there.[%p]
