[name]Takuya[line](She looks so weak⋯like she has no energy at all.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯?)[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I can't take this anymore.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]*thump thump*[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Koudai⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's covering her face with her hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's covering her face with her hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She doesn't seem very excited.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What should I do?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It doesn't really seem like a good time to talk.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's hair⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems pretty tired.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her hair is always so beautiful.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](But it looks so flat and dull right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just stop it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her bra strap⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the time to look at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Just look at her. She's not normal.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's her bra strap.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be looking at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Never mind.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I doubt she'll get that joke now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I wouldn't be able to do that with her even when she's sober.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](So obviously now is not the time⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh man⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hey, isn't there anywhere else I can look at?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's legs⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Her legs are stretched out under the table.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She seems worried about something. That's the feeling I get.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I don't know if I should even talk to her.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What would she be so worried about though?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a chair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I shouldn't be worried about sitting down right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a chair I can use to sit at the counter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's plump butt is right in the chair.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It can't be.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Is Ayumi crying?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Huh?![%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Takuya⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What are you doing up at this hour?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]I should be asking you the same question.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]I'm just⋯ Hehe, thinking about something. Are you feeling better?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Yeah, I feel fine.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Good. Should I make you something to eat?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Ayumi.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Wh-What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Don't change the subject.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Can't you look me in the face when you talk to me?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]My makeup is running a little bit. I'm sorry.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Hey, Ayumi?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]What is it?[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]We're family, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]You're the one that said a family was built on trust, right?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Right⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]What are you so worried about?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Is there something you can't tell me?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, of course not. You're the only family I have, Takuya.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]It's really nothing. I'm just a little tired.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Talk to me.[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]My makeup is running right now, so please don't look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Turn off the light.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Uh-okay⋯[%p]
*gulp*[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]Wh-What⋯?[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Don't look at me.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]A-Ayumi⋯[%p]
[name]Ayumi[line]Hehe, I'm so ugly right now.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line]That's⋯not true.[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](My heart is pounding.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](What am I getting so nervous for?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi might notice if my heart is beating this loudly.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Whew! Okay, just⋯ Just calm down.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi is just a little tired.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Oh.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A drop of water?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Glasses⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Sitting so lonely on top of the counter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](She's covering her face with her hands.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](If she were wearing glasses right now, they'd be digging into her face.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's really none of my business.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi's glasses are on the counter.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi took her glasses off.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who cares about the shadow?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's a shadow cast by the light.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](That's the faucet to my house.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I'll drink plenty of water later.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](The faucet⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Turning the right side gives me cold water, and the left side gives me hot water.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I know there's no need to explain how faucets work⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the time to look at that, is it?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](A systemized kitchen.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This is where Ayumi cooks.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Speaking of cooking, the only thing I can make is curry and rice⋯)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Who cares about curry?)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](There's some kind of water dripping in Ayumi's shadow.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi has her elbow leaning on it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Hm? It's in her shadow so it's hard to tell, but it looks like some kind of water is dripping.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Ayumi isn't herself right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I should look at Ayumi right now.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](It's not the time to look at that.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](No. That's not it.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](I can't use that here.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](Anyway, Ayumi is acting strange.)[%p]
[name]Takuya[line](This isn't the time to be using stuff.)[%p]
