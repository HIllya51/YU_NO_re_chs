(1) Specification changes
  (a) Added the following options to the Other settings in the Build settings:
      - To specify header file name.
      - To specify a prefix for program symbols defined in the headr file
      - To specify a suffix for program symbols defined in the headr file
  (b) Added the "Renumber all IDs by file name" command in the Edit menu, which renumbers ID from 0 for all the files.
      Previously, in the case where files are added to a CPK file, to access files in the order of IDs, they should have been renumberd manually.
  (c) The performance of adding a large amount of files are improved.
      [Example] 
      Under the condition that 23,498 files and 3,369 folders will be added,
      the processing time has been improved from 38.093sec to 12.121sec.

(2) Bug fixes
Fixed the following bugs:
  (a) The content of CSV file output was indefinite.
      If groups exist, it was output in the placement order.
      If groups do not exist, it was output in the ID order.

  (b) Updated the Visual C++ runtime from 2008 to 2010.

(2) Bug fixes
Fixed the following bugs:
  (a) Select a file mode that contains "Group", and perform the Clean Build with the configuration that the data alignment and the group file alignment are different.  After that, when performing the additional build with the Difference Part Only enabled, an error "Invalid alignment setting." occurs even though the alignment settings are changed.
  (b) When performing the additional build with the alignment setting changed, error checking process does not work, and therefore a CPK file with non-consistent alignment setting is created.
  (c) Adjusted highlight color in the selected row in the [File list] pane.
      Fixed a problem that characters are unreadable on some environmet.
  (d) When registering a large content file and then executing the trial compression, clicking a directory in the file pane causes an exception.
  (e) In the decompression process of CPK file, while decompressing a large content file, a slowdon occurs and temporarily indicates "no response."

  (f) If the decompression process of CPK file fails in the CPK File Viewer, no error message is displayed.
  (g) When WinRAR and CPK File Builder are used together, an exception may occur. 
  (h) Group alignment is not applied for the first non-compressed file in the group.
      If a smaller value than the minimum value of seek operation on the target is set to the attribute alignment, the first non-compressed file cannot be loaded or group-loaded.
  (i) The constant macro CPK_TOTAL_INFO_SIZE_ALIGNED, which was output in the header file, is not correct in the roundup calculation.
  (j) When performing the additional build in the "Filename+Id+Group" mode, all the content files become a target file regardless of changes to the content file.

(3) Specification changes
  (a) Corrected the description of items such as checkbox or selected items.
  (b) Even when "checkig" is performed by default, a file which extension is registered as non-compressed file will not be checked.
  (c) Packing order control is improved so that non-compressed and compressed files in a group can be separated and grouped into individual groups.
      In the case where non-compressed and compressed files are mixed in a group, the total size of groups is reduced, and the performance of group loading is improved.
  (d) Added the "Yes to all" button in some dialogs which can avoid answering for the same question multiple times, such as deleting many items.

(4) New features
  (a) Added an option to output the update range information also in the GUI version tool.
      [Build Options] -> [Other Settings] -> [Output update range info]
      Output file name: "<CPK file base name>_addrange.csv"
  (b) Added the display of work size required to buind a CPK file in the CPK File Viewer.
      [Notes]
      The size displayed in the CPK File Viwer is the size needed to bind a CPK file on the PC (x86) environment.
      The size to bind a CPK file is different depending on the platform, and so please consider it as a rough indication.

      .afs;.acx;.aax;.adx;.ahx;.aif;.aiff;.wav;.sfd;.m1v;.hca;.hcamx;.cpk;
      .aix;.awb;.acb;.acf;.usa;.usm;.usv;.self;.sprx;.sdat;.mself;.mpg;.mp3;
      .h264;.aac;.at9;.vag;.cwav;.p256

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 * 4. Revision History of CRI Packed File Maker for Console
 *--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
[2015-03-20 CRI Packed File Maker for Console Ver.2.48.00] ------------------
[Common]
(1) New features
  (a) Added the following option:
      -cpkroot=[Path]
      This option adds the specified path at the top of the content file path (CPK file path)

(2) Specification changes
  (a) Removed the waiting process for key-in during displaying the usage.

[2014-09-19 CRI Packed File Maker for Console Ver.2.47.04] ------------------
(1) New features
  (a) Added the following option:
      -noerrorstop
      This option disables a key-in waiting process even in the case of error.

[2014-08-01 CRI Packed File Maker for Console Ver.2.47.02] ------------------
(1) New features
  (a) Added the following option:
      - cpkproj
      This option creates a .cpkproj file for CPK File Builder after building a CPK file.

[2014-07-14 CRI Packed File Maker for Console Ver.2.47.00] ------------------
(1) Specification changes
  (a) If a file extension is specified as output file name, the file is output without changing the specified extension.
      Without file extension, it is set to .cpk.

[2014-03-05 CRI Packed File Maker for Console Ver.2.45.00] ------------------
(1) Bug fixes
Fixed the following bugs:
  (a) When performing the additional build with the alignment setting changed, error checking process does not work, and therefore a CPK file with non-consistent alignment setting is created.
  (b) Group alignment is not applied for the first non-compressed file in the group.
      If a smaller value than the minimum value of seek operation on the target is set to the attribute alignment, the first non-compressed file cannot be loaded or group-loaded.
  (c) The constant macro CPK_TOTAL_INFO_SIZE_ALIGNED, which was output in the header file, is not correct in the roundup calculation.
  (d) Enhanced the error checking for the additional build.
      Specifically, if the condition is not appropriate, a warning will be displayed to stop the process.
      Examples of non-appropriate conditions are shown below:
      - combination use of -nolocalinfo and -add options
      - combination use of -nolocalinfo and -add options
      - specifying -add option to the CPK file build with -nolocalinfo option
      - specifying -add option to the CPK file build with -nodatetime option
  (e) On the execution of additional build, the group search information in the CPK file becomes invalid, and therefore CPU load in the group loader related APIs cannot be reduced.
     (CPU load reduction in the additional build  was ineffective in cpkmakec Ver.2.41.01.)

(2) Specification changes
  (a) CompressAdd mode for the compression setting is added to resolve a problem that redundant file are added when adding files by CSV file.
      In the file addition with the old Compress/Uncompress option, there was some inconsistency in the CPK file.
      If the CompressAdd option is specified, a file that does not exist in the CPK is compressed, and a file that exists in the CPK file is processed depending on the compression settings.  As a result, useless redundant additions can be avoided.
      When repeating file additions by an automatically generated CSV file, specify the CompressAdd option for all the files.
  (b) Packing order control is improved so that non-compressed and compressed files in a group can be separated and grouped into individual groups.
      In the case where non-compressed and compressed files are mixed in a group, the total size of groups is reduced, and the performance of group loading is improved.

[2013-04-05 CRI Packed File Maker for Console Ver.2.42.00] ------------------
(1) Specification changes
  (a) CPK file with non-CPK file extension can be indentified to display its information.

          which is valid when using the group load feature.
      -attralign=<Attribute Alignment File List>
          Specifies a CSV file in which attribute name and alignment size 
          are enumerated, and specifies file alignment by attribute.

  (b) Added a CPK file verification feature.
      Using this feature, a CPK file already built can be verified against 
      the original file contents that are registered in the project.
      [Usage]
      cpkmakec <Input CSV File or Directory> <Input CPK File> -verify
